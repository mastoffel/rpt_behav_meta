The first purpose of this report is to give an overview of the distribution of these factors among the different taxonomical bacterial divisions and to determine the degree of conservation of the main structural features of the PLP binding domain. Complete proteomes of bacteria phyla were scanned with a hidden Markov model representative of the MocR family. Results indicate that presence of MocR factors is heterogeneous even within the single bacterial phylum: some species miss completely the factors, while others possess one or even more regulators. Absence of MocR factors is distinctive of some phyla such as Chlamydiae. The genomic distribution of MocR is, as expected, highly correlated to the size of the genome. At variance, phyla missing MocR regulators generally are characterized by compact genomes, of the order of 1.0-2.0 Mb, such as the case of Mollicutes or Chlamydiae. Apparently, the minimum genome size compatible with the presence of MocR genes is around 2.0-2.5 Mb. Conservation of the residues corresponding to those involved in the interaction with the cofactor pyridoxa1-5'-phosphate in the homologous 2-aminoadipate aminotransferase, was analyzed in the multiple sequence alignments of MocR within each phyla considered. In the vast majority of cases, residues are conserved or conservatively replaced. This result suggests that, in most cases, MocR factors preserve at least ability to bind the cofactor and very likely some catalytic abilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We develop exploitation-extinction theory for a mammal life history using R-0 < 1 as N goes to zero, and combine the criterion with several facts about mammal life histories.Conclusions: Extinction results if the ratio of the instantaneous mortality rate caused by hunting (F) divided by the adult instantaneous mortality rate (M, for the unexploited population) exceeds a critical value (F/M > C). The C value is determined mostly by the level of recruitment compensation as N declines, and C is likely very similar for different sized mammals. We use existing mammal life-history data to estimate C (-0.5). We then estimate the threshold of instantaneous mortality rate, F, as a function of adult body mass, W; it's a -0.25 power allometry. Finally, we extend the model to fish. C is expected to vary a lot between fish species, mostly because fish are expected to have much larger recruitment compensation than mammals, the recruitment may correlate with body size, and immature fish are often not exploited. We show how to combine these to predict C."

The classical interpretation of adaptation involves a process of successive substitution whereby a new dominant genotype arises by mutation from the genotype previously dominant and spreads more or less rapidly through the population until it is nearly fixed. The population is, thus, nearly uniform most of the time. Some observations suggest that the process may be more complicated, but it remains formidably difficult to assemble the phylogeny of an evolving culture in sufficient detail to be sure. We report experiments with an electronic microcosm inhabited by self-replicating computer programs whose phylogeny can be rendered completely transparent. The physiology of these programs is different in many respects from that of organic creatures, but their population biology has many features in common, including a very extensive, if not unbounded, range of variation. Experimental populations evolved through point mutations (many of which were quasineutral when they were viable) and through rearrangements that led to a change in genome size and often had large effects on fitness. As a general rule, smaller genomes execute fewer instructions in order to replicate, the rate of replication increases as the number of instructions executed declines, and the rate of replication in pure culture is a good predictor of success in mixture. When cultured with CPU (central processing unit) time as the sole limiting resource, smaller genomes, therefore, evolve as a correlated response to natural selection for faster replication. The genetic basis of adaptation was highly contingent and always differed in replicate experiments. The pattern of evolution depends on mutation rate. At low mutation rates of 0.01 per genome per generation or less, we observed classic periodic selection, with each dominant genotype descending from the previous dominant and rising to a frequency of 0.8 or more. At higher mutation rates of about 0.1 per genome per generation, the most abundant genotypes rarely exceeded a frequency of about 0.4, and rare genotypes present in a few copies comprised a large part of the population. New dominant genotypes did not usually descend directly from previous dominants but, instead, from one of the many rare or moderately abundant genotypes. We suggest that the conventional chemostat paradigm may hold only as a special case at very low mutation rates and that the dynamics and diversity of evolving populations, even in the simplest conditions, may be more complex than is usually recognized. Artificial genetic auto-adaptive systems are likely to be useful in constructing theory for situations that lie beyond the boundary of conventional population genetics."

Analysis of 3 80 PCR-amplified sequences, corresponding to a conserved domain of the subset of Ty1-copia reverse transcriptase (rt) gene amplifiable with degenerate standard primers, showed high levels of intra- and interspecific heterogeneity. Nucleotide diversity (Pi) of the copia fragments was high in all species and varied from 0.229 (H. angustifolia) to 0.412 (H. chillensis). Higher sequence heterogeneity correlates positively with larger genome size among analyzed species. Phylogenetic analyses of amplified fragments revealed different patterns of intraspecific heterogeneity within species, with most sequences forming one well-supported main clade while a few sequences fall into small clades or are left ungrouped. The combined analysis of all sequences revealed the presence of three main clades and showed that highly diverged species contain closely related Ty1-copia group retrotransposons. One of the main clades includes rt sequences of all South American species and three sequences of their putative ancestor, H. angustifolia, but no sequence of the Old World H. maculata. FISH with copia retrotransposons in four Hypochaeris species, including H. maculata and H. angustifolia and New World H. apargioides and H. spathulata, revealed differences in the chromosomal distribution between the two groups. In Old World species copia retroelements are distributed over the whole length of the chromosomes, excluding rDNA sites and some centromeres. In the South American species the two largest chromosome pairs are enriched in copia, while most of the long arms of the two small pairs of chromosomes are devoid of these elements. The patterns of heterogeneity and chromosomal distribution of Ty1-copia retrotransposons in Hypochaeris are discussed in the context of the origin, genome evolution and organization of the South American species.

Despite nearly six decades having passed since its first emergence, different studies have shown that type II FCoV represents only a small portion of the total FCoV seropositivity in cats; hence, there is very limited knowledge of the evolution of type II FCoV. To elucidate the correlation between viral emergence and FIP, a local isolate (NTU156) that was derived from a FIP cat was analyzed along with other worldwide strains. Containing an in-frame deletion of 442 nucleotides in open reading frame 3c, the complete genome size of NTU156 (28,897 nucleotides) appears to be the smallest among the known type II feline coronaviruses. Bootscan analysis revealed that NTU156 evolved from two crossover events between type I FCoV and canine coronavirus, with recombination sites located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and M genes. With an exchange of nearly one-third of the genome with other members of alphacoronaviruses, the new emerging virus could gain new antigenicity, posing a threat to cats that either have been infected with a type I virus before or never have been infected with FCoV."

The C value for H. midae was estimated to be 1.43 pg, which is smaller in comparison with other abalone species with the same number of chromosomes (2n = 36), namely H. corrugata, 2.14 pg; H. rufescens, 1.82 pg; and H. fulgens, 1.71 pg. In these Californian abalone species, a positive correlation between C value and the number of metacentric/submetacentric chromosomes with a subsequent loss of submetacentric/subtelocentric chromosomes was observed. Karyotypic analysis in H. midae indicates 6M + 10SM +2 ST (metacentric + submetacentric + subtelocentric) chromosome pairs, the lowest number of metacentric and the highest number of subtelocentric chromosomes when compared with the Californian species. This pattern, in the light of recent phylogenetic and cytogenetic evidence, leads us to hypothesize that during the evolution of the genus, there were some preferential karyotypic rearrangements. Research on the genome size of other abalone species in general and specifically South African species, combined with chromosome banding techniques, could provide more insight into the evolution of this genus."

Both phages exhibited a similar morphology consisting of a polyhedral head and a tail but differed considerably in their host specificities and the size and topology of their genomes. Phage PHIF1 contained a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of 85 +/- 5 kb in size and showed a broad host range including M. thermoformicicum strains Z-245, FTF, FF1, FF3 and CSM3, and M. thermoautotrophicum strain DELTAH. In contrast, PHIF3 phage particles contained a circular or terminally redundant linear genome, comprising approximately 36 +/- 2 kb double-stranded DNA, and could only be propagated on M. thermoformicicum strain FF3. Hybridization experiments did not reveal similarity between the genomes of PHIF1 and PHIF3 nor between both phages and genomic DNA from different thermophilic members of the genus Methanobacterium or DNA from phage PSIM1 of M. thermoautotrophicum Marburg. A physical map of both phage genomes was constructed. The DNA of phage PHIF1 was found to contain multiple GGCC sites which form the target for the restriction-modification (R/M) system MthTI of M. thermoformicicum THF. In contrast, the DNA of PHIFI contained only a single CTAG site recognized by the R/M systems MthZI and MthFI of M. thermoformicicum Z-245 and FTF, respectively. The distribution of these sites correlates well with the capacity of PHIFI to infect M. thermoformicicum strains Z-245 and FTF but not strain THF."

Measured concentrations (C) of atmospheric CO2 ranged from 369 to 475 ppm, while the 8(13)C values ranged from -12.0 to -8.1parts per thousand. These values contrast with a ""global"" concentration at the time of this study of approximately 367 ppm and a corresponding delta(13)C value of about -8.0parts per thousand. delta(13)C was linearly correlated with I/C for samples collected at heights of similar to2 m at 3 sites adjacent to streets with significant automobile traffic. Extrapolation of this two-component mixing line to I/C = 0 yielded a delta(13)C value of about -27parts per thousand for the CO2 input-i.e., the same as that of gasoline. A simple box model, incorporating photosynthesis, respiration, and anthropogenic addition of CO2, indicates that differences between downwind and upwind concentration-weighted 8(13)C values (Delta[C*delta(13)C]) of atmospheric CO2 may be linearly correlated with downwind and upwind differences in concentration (C*(d) - C*(u)), where C* is reported as mol/m(3). d U. The model predicts that measurable effects of photosynthetic withdrawal of atmospheric CO2 are manifested by data arrays with slopes more positive than about -16. This effect of photosynthesis is evident in a linear array of ""warm weather"", Dallas atmospheric CO2 data (slope of -12.7parts per thousand). Collectively, the data for all 8 sites exhibited considerable scatter about binary mixing lines that depict the addition of CO2 from combustion of natural gas and gasoline. However, when model slopes (m) were calculated for binary mixing between a ""background"" atmospheric CO2 and each individual sample, it was found that, in general, m increases with decreasing temperature. The effects of photosynthesis and respiration complicate this relationship, but the overall pattern suggests that, as temperature decreases, the proportion of anthropogenic CO2 derived from combustion of natural gas increases. This increase appears to reflect increased use of natural gas for home heating, etc., in cooler weather. Therefore, seasonally changing patterns of fossil fuel use are detectable in the atmospheric CO2 of this urban environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

RCI, denoted as k(C), was determined from the slope of a developed expression: % Delta L = A(C) exp. - k(C) C, where % Delta L is the percentage reduction in the powder column due to tabletting. The constant A(C) stands for the percentage reduction in the control (unlubricated) powder column due to tabletting. Magnesium stearate (MS) gave the smallest k(C) value and was therefore indicated as a reference lubricant. The percentage relative lubrication efficacy (%RLE) of an), tested lubricating material was calculated. It was in the case of granulation 77% with stearic acid, 32% with sodium lauryl sulfate and 25% with talc while in direct compression mixes it was 44% with stearic acid, 57% with sodium lauryl sulfate and 41% with talc, respectively. RCI or k(C) values were found to be correlated to the hardness and dissolution of the tablets."

The initiated cell lines (1992 until 1999) were maintained via secondary embryogenesis on P24 medium with 0.9 muM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) in regular subculture intervals of 6 weeks. Regenerated plants established in the greenhouse and in vitro plantlets derived from encapsulated somatic embryos were screened. The embryogenic cell lines were characterized as individual clones by isoenzyme analysis. Flow cytometric relative DNA content analysis of the first screening period revealed that somaclonal variation in form of tetraploidy occurred in two out of 26 tested somatic embryo clones (Alt and Jung). These two clones lost their ability to convert into plantlets. Intraspecific relative DNA content variation including technical variation was below 3%. In the second screening period, however, 3 out of 37 clones (Alt, E4.31H9 and P3.27H) contained tetraploid cells leading to the assumption that the frequency of tetraploidy seems to be correlated with the duration of in vitro culture. No chromosomal differences were detected in regenerated plants. However, tetraploidy occurred in 8% of the tested clones over a culture period of 7 years."

Although genome sequencing in Afrotheria is not complete, extensive homology with human has been revealed by chromosome painting. We provide new data on chromosome size and GC content in four Afrotherian species using flow karyotyping. Genome sizes are 4.13 Gb in aardvark, 4.01 Gb in African elephant, 3.69 Gb in golden mole and 3.31 Gb in manatee, whereas published results show a mean of 5.18 Gb for Afrotheria. Genome GC content shows a negative correlation with size, indicating that this is due to differences in the amount of AT-rich sequences. Low genome GC content and small variance in chromosome GC content are characteristic of aardvark and elephant and may be associated with the high degree of conserved synteny, suggesting that these are features of the Afrotherian ancestral genome.
