In fishes, these behaviors may increase individual vulnerability to angling. To test the predictions of the POLS concept, we quantified individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and boldness in both wild-caught and hatchery-reared Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). We found both SMR and boldness to be repeatable traits but detected no correlation between them. Individual vulnerability to angling was assessed in the hatchery-reared perch, but we found no difference in boldness or SMR between vulnerable and nonvulnerable perch. Wild-caught perch were ice fished using either natural or artificial bait, and we observed no differences in boldness or SMR with respect to bait type or capture order. Our findings do not support the predictions of the POLS concept and, consistent with earlier studies in perch, suggest that angling may not drive selection against boldness in this species.","10.1086/700434","1522-2152","1537-5293","ISI:000446603600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,174,267,"#000000",NA,""

More exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity.","10.1093/cz/zox053","1674-5507","2396-9814","ISI:000447424600004",NA,NA,NA,NA,2,184,245,"#000000",NA,""

However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations.","10.1371/journal.pone.0204619","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000446124700027","e0204619","Langbein, Jan/0000-0002-1170-5431",NA,NA,3,220,377,"#000000",NA,""

Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after 2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability; however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality research.","10.1007/s00265-018-2582-7","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000445192700005","UNSP 166","O'Neill, Samuel/0000-0002-1339-4681",NA,NA,4,198,347,"#000000",NA,""

We undertook two studies of cow behaviour as they passed a novel person, to validate these behaviours as emotional indicators, in addition to determining correlations to other indices of emotional state. Cows passing to the right were more likely to have a raised or tucked tail, sniff the ground, walk slowly and a faster exit when put in a crush, compared with those passing to the left, which had their ears held forwards. From a principal component analysis, it was determined that cows passing on the right side were also most likely to pass without turning their head towards the person, pass singly and defecate whilst passing. However, those passing to the left side were most likely to turn to look at the person and pass in pairs. Cows with high milk yields were more likely to pass on the right side. Measurements of side of passage were repeatable between experiments but those of ear position were not. It is concluded that side of passage past a person correlates with other behavioural indicators of the cow's emotional state, with those passing to the right (i.e. left eye/right brain hemisphere) apparently more anxious. Evidence was also provided that high yielding cows are more anxious, as assessed by right side passage. With further validation, side of passage past a person could be developed as a simple measure of emotional state in dairy cows that can be conducted under field conditions.","10.1016/j.applanim.2018.06.008","0168-1591","1872-9045","ISI:000445316300002",NA,NA,NA,NA,5,11,102,"#000000",NA,""

Yet, while there is a vast literature on repeatable individual differences in behaviour, relatively little is known about the repeatability of cognitive performance. To further our understanding of the evolution of cognition, we gathered 44 studies on individual performance of 25 species across six animal classes and used meta-analysis to assess whether cognitive performance is repeatable. We compared repeatability (R) in performance (1) on the same task presented at different times (temporal repeatability), and (2) on different tasks that measured the same putative cognitive ability (contextual repeatability). We also addressed whether R estimates were influenced by seven extrinsic factors (moderators): type of cognitive performance measurement, type of cognitive task, delay between tests, origin of the subjects, experimental context, taxonomic class and publication status. We found support for both temporal and contextual repeatability of cognitive performance, with mean R estimates ranging between 0.15 and 0.28. Repeatability estimates were mostly influenced by the type of cognitive performance measures and publication status.

It is, therefore, crucial to determine the relative extent of genetic versus environmental control of these among-individual differences in cognitive traits to understand their causes and evolutionary potential. We investigated heritability of associative learning performance and of a cognitive judgement bias (optimism), as well as their covariation, in a captive pedigree-bred population of red junglefowl (Gallus gallus, n. 300 chicks over 5 years). We analysed performance in discriminative and reversal learning (two facets of associative learning), and cognitive judgement bias, by conducting animal models to disentangle genetic from environmental contributions. We demonstrate moderate heritability for reversal learning, and weak to no heritability for optimism and discriminative learning, respectively. The two facets of associative learning were weakly negatively correlated, consistent with hypothesized trade-offs underpinning individual cognitive styles. Reversal, but not discriminative learning performance, was associated with judgement bias; less optimistic individuals reversed a previously learnt association faster. Together these results indicate that genetic and environmental contributions differ among traits. While modular models of cognitive abilities predict a lack of common genetic control for different cognitive traits, further investigation is required to fully ascertain the degree of covariation between a broader range of cognitive traits and the extent of any shared genetic control.

Clonal animals are ideal models for developmental studies because personality differences can be solely attributed to environmental factors. Here, I investigated the presence of personality within a species of clonal gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, at different developmental stages. For juveniles and adult geckos, I measured exploration (reaction to a novel situation) and boldness (risk-prone tendency) and evaluated repeatability and correlation of these behavioural traits. Each gecko exhibited different exploration and boldness with significant repeatability through time but no correlation between these behavioural traits. Small juveniles were composed of only bold and low explorative individuals but large juveniles and adults were composed of various personality type individuals. These results demonstrate that subject geckos have a similar personality structure across life stages and that exploration and boldness are independent personality without forming behavioural syndrome structure. Biased composition of personality type between life stages suggests that appearance of different personality type individuals during an early ontogenetic stage generates personality variation within the clonal population.

It has been proposed recently that not only mean behaviour (behavioural type), but the environmentally induced behavioural change (behavioural plasticity) might also differ between individuals within populations. While case studies presenting between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity have started to accumulate, the mechanisms behind its emergence are virtually unknown. We have recently demonstrated that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli during ontogeny are necessary for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes. However, it is unknown whether between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity is hard-wired or induced. Here, we tested whether experience with predation during development affected predator-induced behavioural plasticity in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We ran a common garden experiment with two ontogenetic predation treatments: tadpoles developed from hatching in either the presence or absence of olfactory predator stimuli. Then, we assayed all tadpoles repeatedly for activity and risk-taking both in the absence and presence of olfactory predator stimuli. We found that (a) between-individual variation in predator-induced behavioural plasticity was present only in the group that developed in the presence of olfactory stimuli from predators and (b) previous experience with predatory stimuli resulted in lower plastic response at the group level. The latter pattern resulted from increased between-individual variation and not from universally lower individual responses. We also found that experience with predation during development increased the predictability (i.e. decreased the within-individual variation unrelated to environmental change) of activity, but not risk-taking. In line with this, tadpoles developing under perceived predatory risk expressed their activity with higher repeatability. We suggest that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli are not only fundamental for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes, but also for individual variation in behavioural plasticity. Thus, experience is of central importance for the emergence of individual behavioural variation at many levels.","10.1111/1365-2656.12847","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000441246100007",NA,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,9,226,96,"#000000",NA,""

While controlling for the marked effects of habituation, we found clear between-population differences in the stress-induced cortisol response. Roe deer living in the area that was recently recolonized by lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolves (Canis lupus) expressed cortisol levels that were around 30\% higher than roe deer in the human-dominated landscape free of large carnivores.

Indeed, stress-induced cortisol levels were of similar magnitude and differed between populations to a similar extent in both neonates and adults. Finally, at an individual level, we found that both cortisol and docility levels were strongly repeatable, and weakly negatively inter-correlated, suggesting that individuals differed consistently in how they respond to a stressor, and supporting the existence of a stress-management syndrome in roe deer.","10.1007/s00442-018-4174-7","0029-8549","1432-1939","ISI:000441953300008",NA,NA,NA,NA,10,655,495,"#000000",NA,""

We applied a binary scoring system to code each participant's performance in each study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not (Social Information Score-'SIS'). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age, prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females were, depending on their rearing history, 15-24\% more likely to use social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However, there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience, and pedigree records indicated that SIS was not a strongly heritable trait.

These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that, depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent, suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding.

Here we quantified the effects of sex on individual foraging site fidelity (IFSF), both within and between years, in chick-brooding Campbell albatross Thalassarche impavida. Using bird-borne global positioning system loggers, we calculated route fidelity (nearest-neighbour distance), repeatability of site fidelity (terminal latitude and longitude), and foraging effort (total distance travelled and trip duration) during 2 to 10 repeat trips. Overall, Campbell albatrosses showed a high degree of site fidelity. Birds travelled to similar sites not only within the same year, but also between 2 consecutive years, suggesting that the within-year consistency is not simply in response to short-term patches of food. Moreover, within the same year, we found differences in terms of IFSF between the sexes. Females that foraged closer to the colony in neritic and shelf waters were more likely to follow similar routes on repeated foraging trips and were more consistent in their foraging effort than males.

However, this assumption remains largely untested. Here, we conducted an experiment with sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) whose behavioral plasticity was estimated both as the change in their personality traits or mating behavior across a social gradient and using their performance on a reversal-learning task. We found that the correlations between pairwise measures of plasticity were weak and non-significant, thus indicating that the most plastic individuals were not the same in all the tests. This finding might arise because either individuals adjust the magnitude of their behavioral responses depending on the benefits of plasticity, and/or individuals expressing high behavioral plasticity in one context are limited by neural and/or physiological constraints in the amount of plasticity they can express in other contexts. Because the repeatability of behavioral plasticity may have important evolutionary consequences, additional studies are needed to assess the importance of trade-offs between conflicting selection pressures on the maintenance of intra-individual variation in behavioral plasticity.","10.7717/peerj.5454","2167-8359",NA,"ISI:000441110200010","e5454","Gibelli, Julie/0000-0001-6158-5231",NA,NA,16,49,16,"#405d99","selected",""

The objectives of this study were to assess the phenotypic variability in core body temperature and sweating rate and to evaluate the effect of coat type, temperament, and BW on core body temperature and sweating rate in Brangus heifers. During August and September of 2016, 725 Brangus heifers were evaluated on pasture in four separate groups (n = 200, 189, 197, and 139). Environmental measurements of dry bulb temperature (T-db) and relative humidity (RH) were measured every 15 min during the entire time of data collection and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to quantify heat-stress potential. Coat score, sweating rate, chute score, exit score, and live weight were recorded as the animals passed through the chute. Vaginal temperature was recorded every 5 min for five consecutive days. There was significant variation in vaginal temperature between heifers in the same environmental conditions (sigma(2)(u) = 0.049), suggesting opportunities for selective improvements. A repeatability of 0.47 and 0.44 was estimated for sweating rate and vaginal temperature, respectively, suggesting that one measurement would be able to adequately describe the sweating capacity or ability to control the body temperature of an individual. Vaginal temperature increased as THI increased, with approximately 1 h lag time in the animal's response. Vaginal temperature (-0.047 degrees C, P = 0.015) and sweating rate were lower (-5.49 +/- 2.12 g/(m(2).h), P < 0.01) for heifers that demonstrated a calmer behavior in the chute. Animals with shorter, smoother hair coats had significantly lower vaginal temperatures when compared to animals with longer hair coats (P < 0.01).

Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, as the specific mechanisms driving this organization are difficult to identify in already organized groups typically found in the wild, the contribution of interindividual variation to group level behaviour remains enigmatic. Here, we present results of an experiment to create and compare groups that vary in social organization, and study how individual behaviour varies between these groups. We iteratively sorted individuals between groups of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by ranking the groups according to their directional alignment and then mixing similar groups. Over the rounds of sorting the consistency of the group rankings increased, producing groups that varied significantly in key social behaviours such as collective activity and group cohesion. The repeatability of the underlying individual behaviour was then estimated by comparing the experimental data to simulations. At the level of basic locomotion, individuals in more coordinated groups displayed stronger interactions with the centre of the group, and weaker interactions with their nearest neighbours. We propose that this provides the basis for a passive phenotypic assortment mechanism that may explain the structures of social networks in the wild.

Behavioral variation is known to influence animal invasions, yet comparatively less is known about how behavioral variation influences invasive-native species interactions. Here we examined how the mean and variance surrounding several behavioral traits in two sympatric species of praying mantis differ and how these behavioral types translate to actual prey capture success using the introduced European mantis, Mantis religiosa, and the native bordered mantis, Stagmomantis limbata. We assayed time spent in the open (risk proneness), response towards a novel prey, and voracity within a population of M. religiosa and S. limbata. We found that the native and invasive mantids displayed no differences in their average behavioral tendencies. The native exhibited significant levels of repeatability in voracity while the invasive did not. The lack of repeatability in the invasive appears to be driven by lower levels of among-individual variation in voracity. This may have evolutionary consequences for native S. limbata if it results in strong selection in native levels of mean and among-individual variation. Significant levels of among-individual differences were found in other behaviors (response to a novel prey and risk proneness) across species, suggesting less selection on invasive behavioral variation in these traits. Risk proneness and response towards a novel prey also formed a behavioral syndrome across species, yet neither behavior was correlated with voracity in either species. Our results illustrate the need to examine the ecological effects of behavioral variation of both invasive and native species to determine how that might impact invasive-native interactions.","10.1016/j.beproc.2018.05.011","0376-6357","1872-8308","ISI:000438833700012",NA,NA,NA,NA,23,64,308,"#000000",NA,""

Does this conflict with potential phenotypic plasticity which should be adaptive for animals facing various contexts and situations? This fundamental question has been tested predominantly in studies which were done in non-breeding contexts and under laboratory conditions. Therefore, in the present study we examined the temporal stability of behavioural correlations in a breeding context and under natural conditions. We found that in the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) females, the intensity of their nest defence formed a behavioural syndrome with two other traits: their aggression during handling (self-defence) and stress responses during handling (breath rate). This syndrome was stable across the nesting cycle: each of the three behavioural traits was highly statistically repeatable between egg and nestling stages and the traits were strongly correlated with each other during both the egg stage and the nestling stage. Despite this consistency (i.e., rank order between stages) the individual behaviours changed their absolute values significantly during the same period. This shows that stable behavioural syndromes might be based on behaviours that are themselves unstable. Thus, syndromes do not inevitably constrain phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that the observed behavioural syndrome is the product of interactions between behavioural and life history trade-offs and that crucial proximate mechanisms for the plasticity and correlations between individual behaviours are hormonally-regulated.","10.1016/j.beproc.2018.06.003","0376-6357","1872-8308","ISI:000438833700013",NA,"Grim, Tomas/0000-0002-5775-6269","Samas, Peter/E-3152-2016 ",NA,24,551,290,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks. Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive period for behavioural development.","10.1016/j.yhbeh.2018.06.010","0018-506X","1095-6867","ISI:000441368400015",NA,NA,NA,NA,27,154,508,"#000000",NA,""

Yet the factors driving variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion. Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ. Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of 36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range: 0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on T-set did not increase its repeatability.

Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We found a general decline in investment in cell construction and provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r0.15), and traits were loosely organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of independent evolutionary trajectories.","10.1111/jeb.13259","1010-061X","1420-9101","ISI:000437121200002",NA,"Prasifka, Jarrad/0000-0002-6165-7319 Royaute, Raphael/0000-0002-5837-633X Bowsher, Julia/0000-0001-6347-9635",NA,NA,31,442,57,"#000000",NA,""

Here we investigated if juvenile Port Jackson sharks could learn to associate a musical stimulus with a food reward, discriminate between two distinct musical stimuli, and whether individual personality traits were linked to cognitive performance. Five out of eight sharks were successfully conditioned to associate a jazz song with a food reward delivered in a specific corner of the tank. We observed repeatable individual differences in activity and boldness in all eight sharks, but these personality traits were not linked to the learning performance assays we examined. These sharks were later trained in a discrimination task, where they had to distinguish between the same jazz and a novel classical music song, and swim to opposite corners of the tank according to the stimulus played. The sharks' performance to the jazz stimulus declined to chance levels in the discrimination task. Interestingly, some sharks developed a strong side bias to the right, which in some cases was not the correct side for the jazz stimulus.","10.1007/s10071-018-1183-1","1435-9448","1435-9456","ISI:000435587400004",NA,"Vila Pouca, Catarina/0000-0001-6956-5198 Brown, Culum/0000-0002-0210-1820",NA,NA,32,245,655,"#000000",NA,""

We used acoustic telemetry to map the migration of the only remaining indigenous population by applying stationary hydrophones combined with manual tracking. Data suggested a total mortality of 26\%, with 30\% of the total mortality attributed to predation by great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), highlighting that North Sea houting conservation could be jeopardised by increased cormorant predation. Risk of cormorant predation was size-dependent, with smaller fish suffering higher risk of predation. The study found North Sea houting to exhibit disparate migration strategies and identified a lentic area in the estuary as an important habitat. Two newly established artificial lakes within the river system significantly reduced the migration speeds, possibly indicating constrained navigation through the lakes. The migration into the Wadden Sea correlated with temperature perhaps indicating osmoregulatory constraints of sea entry. Unlike many salmonid species, migration occurred both day and night. Moreover, fish exhibited repeatable individual differences in diel activity patterns, suggesting that individuals differ consistently in their migratory activity throughout the 24-hr period. Our study provides novel information on salmonid migration, which is crucial for the development of science-based conservation strategies.","10.1111/eff.12383","0906-6691","1600-0633","ISI:000434638800004",NA,"Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981",NA,NA,33,222,36,"#405d99","selected","diel activity"

This can be key in important social dynamics such as leadership, which is often positively related to personality traits such as boldness. Individuals consistently differ in how social they are (their sociability), so if other axes of personality variation, such as boldness, can be suppressed during social interactions, this suppression should be stronger in more sociable individuals. We measured boldness (latency to leave a refuge when alone) and sociability (time spent with a conspecific) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and tested the boldness-leadership association in pairs of these fish. Both boldness and sociability were repeatable, but were not correlated. When splitting the data between the 50\% most sociable and 50\% less sociable fish, boldness was more strongly associated with leadership in less rather than more sociable individuals. This is consistent with more sociable fish conforming to their partner's behaviour due to their greater social tendency. One axis of personality variation (sociability) can thus modulate the relationship between others (boldness and leadership), with potential implications for selection on personality variation in social animals.","10.1098/rspb.2018.0829","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000435198500026","20180829","Ioannou, Christos/0000-0002-9739-889X",NA,NA,34,472,582,"#000000",NA,""

The sea lamprey is invasive in the Upper Laurentian Great Lakes and the target of a binational control program. Trapping could be used for control if trapping efficiency is unbiased and effective. Our test involved comparing the behaviour of sea lamprey collected in the field from a trap (n = 42) at a barrier and electrofished (n = 9) downstream of the barrier. We quantified each individual's latency to exit an enclosure (a measure of exploration), proportion of time spent moving (a measure of general activity), and change in activity in response to a putative predator cue (a measure of boldness). CIDs were detected for each behaviour measured (intraclass correlations: 0.3-0.5). CIDs in behaviour also differed between trapped individuals and those collected downstream using electrofishing, irrespective of size, sex, and maturity status. Trapped individuals decreased their activity in response to a putative predator cue, while individuals collected using electrofishing increased their activity in response to the cue. Trapped individuals also tended to spend a greater proportion of time moving than individuals sampled downstream of the trap. However, the two samples of lamprey did not differ significantly in time taken to exit an enclosure. The behavioural differences between sea lamprey sampled from a trap and those sampled downstream of the trap suggest that CIDs in behaviour can influence an individual's vulnerability to trapping.

One possibility is that among-individual behavioural variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome' in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources, while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality variation observed in wild populations.

While this variability may have important ecological and evolutionary implications, how and why variation in animal personality is maintained in a natural population remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of environmental and biological sources of variation on behavioral responses measured along the shy-bold continuum in a long-lived, iteroparous marine mammal, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). Between 2008 and 2016, 469 females from the Sable Island, Nova Scotia breeding colony of gray seals were given a boldness score in response to a human approach, designed to stimulate maternal defense of offspring. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable between and within years. There were age differences in boldness, with younger females being less bold than older, more experienced females providing some support for the life history trade-off hypothesis. We further used GLMMs to assess sources of variation on offspring weaning mass. We found that young females that were bolder produced heavier pups than shyer counterparts, and that pups produced by bolder females were on average 2 kg heavier than pups of shy females. These results provide further evidence that personality influences life history strategies, and illustrates the evolutionary potential of animal personality in response to selection. Consistent individual differences in behavior influence various aspects of ecology including species interactions, species distributions, and life history strategies. However, how and why this individual variation is maintained in a natural population remains uncertain. In this study, we assessed the influence of boldness, specifically maternal defense of offspring, on a component of reproductive success in a long-lived marine mammal. We showed highly repeatable behavioral differences, and found that boldness varied with age, with younger individuals being less bold than older individuals. Younger individuals that were bolder produced heavier offspring than shyer counterparts. Our study contributes to an under-represented group of animals, wild marine mammals, in the personality literature, and further prompts the investigation into the proximate and ultimate factors influencing personality in an ecologically important marine predator.","10.1007/s00265-018-2515-5","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000434079000001","UNSP 100",NA,NA,NA,39,485,236,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we tested whether the metabolic phenotype of individual fish (x-ray tetras, Pristella maxillaris) determined their relative position within a moving shoal and their tendency to act as leaders. In contrast to previous work, we found that individuals with low maximal metabolic rates and low aerobic scope tended to be more likely to be found at the front of shoals and were more likely to act as leaders. We suggest that leadership by low-performing individuals leads to greater group cohesion.

Our objective was to quantify the effect of fire-altered landscapes on the locomotor performance of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Lizard sprint performance was compared among three habitats with different fire histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more than 60years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in 4years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6months prior to the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of 2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of free-ranging S.undulatus. Lizards had similar body condition among habitats suggesting that nutritional status did not play a role in performance plasticity. Habitats differed both structurally and thermally, and less restrictive thermal regimes in recently burned habitats appear to be the underlying mechanism permitting increased lizard locomotor performance.","10.1111/jzo.12545","0952-8369","1469-7998","ISI:000434146500004",NA,NA,NA,NA,41,238,130,"#000000",NA,""

Many animal social structures are organized hierarchically, with some individuals monopolizing resources. Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. 2. There are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. 3. We simulate interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and the steepness of the hierarchy affect the performance of five methods for inferring hierarchies, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty and steepness in the inferred hierarchy. 4. We find that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the steepness of the hierarchy and the method used. We show that David's score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the best methods when hierarchies are not extremely steep, where the original Elo-rating, the I\&SI and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. In addition, we show that two simple methods can be used to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level, and that the randomized Elo-rating repeatability provides researchers with a standardized measure valid for comparing the steepness of different hierarchies. We provide several worked examples to guide researchers interested in studying dominance hierarchies. 5. Methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust. We recommend that a ratio of observed interactions to individuals of at least 10 (for steep hierarchies), and ideally 20 serves as a good benchmark. Our simple procedures for estimating uncertainty in the observed data will facilitate evaluating whether sufficient data have been collected, while plotting the shape of the hierarchy will provide new insights into the social structure of the study organism.","10.1111/1365-2656.12776","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000430059900007",NA,"Schroeder, Julia/0000-0002-4136-843X Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo/0000-0002-2886-0649 Farine, Damien/0000-0003-2208-7613","Schroeder, Julia/B-1436-2010 ",NA,46,15,579,"#000000",NA,""

In reptiles, incubation temperature is a critical aspect of the early developmental environment. Incubation temperature influences morphology, physiology, and behavior of non-avian reptiles, however, little is known about how incubation temperature influences offspring phenotype and behaviors important to avian survival. To investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors, we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8, and 37.0 degrees C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further, duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative of a proactive-reactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However, neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior. This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained within populations.","10.1002/jez.2176","2471-5646",NA,"ISI:000444678500005",NA,NA,NA,NA,47,286,404,"#000000",NA,""

While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase. Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g. eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits, suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and vice versa.

Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is, activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age. Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits, the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals might affect the further development and survival of populations and thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the ecosystem.

The social environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness, activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation. Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on behaviour.

Breath rate and its change during and after handling {[}handling stress (HS) test] has been used to test individual response to stress. In previous laboratory research, the HS test has revealed a continuous decrease from peak values immediately after catching, which was consistent in adults of precocial and altricial species. Because of opposite trends in nestlings versus adults in altricial birds, we ask what breath rate pattern appears in precocial chicks in natural conditions? Advanced development during their early ontogeny compared to altricials could lead to breath rates similar to adults, but the effect of age, (in)experience, as well as environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, may significantly shape breath rate patterns in chicks in different ways than in adults. In this study, we examined patterns in breath rate in response to HS in chicks of different age in a precocial wader, the Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) in the wild. Factors responsible for variation were simultaneously identified. We show that breath rate significantly dropped after visual isolation in a textile bag, a pattern similar to that in adult birds, and increased with the age of chicks as well as with higher ambient temperature. Breath rate was individually repeatable, but did not reflect individual behaviour observed before capture. Our results suggest that, when controlled for ambient temperature and time before catching, the breath rate pattern has the potential to be used as a useful HS test for neonatal Northern Lapwing chicks in the field.","10.1007/s10336-017-1517-9","0021-8375","1439-0361","ISI:000428955900021",NA,NA,NA,NA,51,101,559,"#000000",NA,""

Moreover, we used census and delta H-2 values of feather and blood to evaluate migration. We found that individual sparrows inhabiting high elevations were larger and showed more intense exploratory behavior in comparison with those that were captured at lower elevation. Moreover, we observed a steady decline in sparrow abundance during the winter and similar delta H-2 values for blood collected in the winter and summer at this site, which were significantly lower than blood delta H-2 values observed at low elevation. This pattern suggests that individuals do not move long distances during winter, and likely they remain at similar elevations in refuge habitats.

However, personality (consistency within a behavioural trait) has not been well studied in the wild. Here we tested whether urban free-living male great tits show greater territorial aggression than rural counterparts. We also tested predictions that both behavioural syndromes and personality would show lower consistency in urban populations. We found that urban populations were more aggressive than rural populations and urban birds appeared to show lower levels of individual behavioural repeatability (personality) as predicted. However, we found no effect of urbanisation on behavioural syndromes (correlations between multiple behavioural traits). Our results indicate that urban environments may favour individuals which exhibit increased territorial aggression and greater within-trait flexibility which may be essential to success in holding urban territories.

Moreover, current studies show that besides interindividual differences, substantial intraindividual variations exist. Therefore, we assume that the potential of regulating affective well-being through sport activities varies situationally. This ambulatory assessment study analyzes affective reactions on sport activities in daily routine to identify possible factors for situational variability of changes in affective well-being. First, situational differences in affective well-being (valence, calmness, energetic arousal), goals for sport activities (e.g., regulation of body weight, activation), and activity characteristics (e.g., activity dose, perceived exertion) were analyzed. Second, associations between these parameters and activity characteristics were dissected. Third, associations with affective well-being after sport activities are identified. For 7 days, 25 women and 21 men (M-age = 32 years) participated. Activity characteristics were captured objectively (accelerometer, electrocardiogramm). Affective well-being, situational goals, and perceived exertion were gathered via smartphone. Multilevel analyses confirmed situational heterogeneity of affective well-being (e.g., intraclass-coefficient ICCvalence = 0.48), situational goals (e.g., ICCactivation = 0.59), and activity characteristics (e.g., ICCactivity (dose) = 0.21). Furthermore, we observed that higher feelings of calmness and stronger situational goals for body weight and activation are followed by a higher activity dose. This higher activity dose comes along with higher energetic arousal after sport activities, whereas higher perceived exertion is followed by lower feelings of calmness. Study results confirm intraindividual variation of affective well-being, specific goals, and activity characteristics. They emphasize the relevance of situational characteristics for the regulation of affective well-being through sport activities.","10.1007/s12662-017-0469-9","2509-3142","2509-3150","ISI:000431588000003",NA,NA,NA,NA,56,550,259,"#000000",NA,""

Objective: This paper aims to describe the development and initial validation of a Web-based, self-report screening instrument (the Screening Assessment for Guiding Evaluation-Self-Report, SAGE-SR) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the SCID-5-Clinician Version (CV) intended to make accurate, broad-based behavioral health diagnostic screening more accessible within clinical care. Methods: First, study staff drafted approximately 1200 self-report items representing individual granular symptoms in the diagnostic criteria for the 8 primary SCID-CV modules. An expert panel iteratively reviewed, critiqued, and revised items. The resulting items were iteratively administered and revised through 3 rounds of cognitive interviewing with community mental health center participants. In the first 2 rounds, the SCID was also administered to participants to directly compare their Likert self-report and SCID responses. A second expert panel evaluated the final pool of items from cognitive interviewing and criteria in the DSM-5 to construct the SAGE-SR, a computerized adaptive instrument that uses branching logic from a screener section to administer appropriate follow-up questions to refine the differential diagnoses. The SAGE-SR was administered to healthy controls and outpatient mental health clinic clients to assess test duration and test-retest reliability. Cutoff scores for screening into follow-up diagnostic sections and criteria for inclusion of diagnoses in the differential diagnosis were evaluated. Results: The expert panel reduced the initial 1200 test items to 664 items that panel members agreed collectively represented the SCID items from the 8 targeted modules and DSM criteria for the covered diagnoses. These 664 items were iteratively submitted to 3 rounds of cognitive interviewing with 50 community mental health center participants; the expert panel reviewed session summaries and agreed on a final set of 661 clear and concise self-report items representing the desired criteria in the DSM-5. The SAGE-SR constructed from this item pool took an average of 14 min to complete in a nonclinical sample versus 24 min in a clinical sample. Responses to individual items can be combined to generate DSM criteria endorsements and differential diagnoses, as well as provide indices of individual symptom severity. Preliminary measures of test-retest reliability in a small, nonclinical sample were promising, with good to excellent reliability for screener items in 11 of 13 diagnostic screening modules intraclass correlation coefficient [}ICC] or kappa coefficients ranging from .60 to .90), with mania achieving fair test-retest reliability (ICC=.50) and other substance use endorsed too infrequently for analysis.

These large (up to 7 kg) lizards exhibited a spectrum of boldness, as reflected in correlated scores of responses to approach, handling, and novel prey. Bolder lizards had larger core home ranges and higher mating success and spent more time in areas of high predator abundance, and their seasonal regimes of predation-induced mortality differed from those of shyer lizards.

We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate.

However, many endocrine traits, such as concentrations of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, exhibit adaptive plasticity and, therefore, do not necessarily respond to these pressures as predicted by among-individual phenotypic correlations. To improve our interpretations of among-individual variation in GC concentrations, we need more information about the repeatability of these traits within individuals. Many studies have already estimated the repeatability of baseline, stress-induced, and integrated GC measures, which provides an opportunity to use meta-analytic techniques to investigate (1) whether GC titers are generally repeatable across taxa, and (2) which biological or methodological factors may impact these estimates. From an intensive search of the literature, we collected 91 GC repeatability estimates from 47 studies. Overall, we found evidence that GC levels are repeatable, with mean repeatability estimates across studies ranging from 0.230 for baseline levels to 0.386 for stress-induced levels. We also noted several factors that predicted the magnitude of these estimates, including taxon, sampling season, and lab technique. Amphibians had significantly higher repeatability in baseline and stress-induced GCs than birds, mammals, reptiles, or bony fish. The repeatability of stress-induced GCs was higher when measured within, rather than across, life history stages. Finally, estimates of repeatability in stress-induced and integrated GC measures tended to be lower when GC concentrations were quantified using commercial kit assays rather than in-house assays. The extent to which among-individual variation in GCs may explain variation in organismal performance or fitness (and thereby inform our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes driving that variation) depends on whether measures of GC titers accurately reflect how individuals differ overall. Our findings suggest that while GC titers can reflect some degree of consistent differences among individuals, they frequently may not. We discuss how our findings contribute to interpretations of variation in GCs, and suggest routes for the design and analysis of future research.","10.7717/peerj.4398","2167-8359",NA,"ISI:000426518200003","e4398",NA,NA,NA,61,495,123,"#000000",NA,""

Previous research has highlighted how universal interaction rules shape collective behaviour, and that individual differences can drive group functioning. Groups themselves may also differ considerably in their collective behaviour, but little is known about the consistency of such group variation, especially across different ecological contexts that may alter individuals' behavioural responses. Here, we test if randomly composed groups of sticklebacks differ consistently from one another in both their structure and movement dynamics across an open environment, an environment with food, and an environment with food and shelter. Based on high-resolution tracking data of the free-swimming shoals, we found large context-associated changes in the average behaviour of the groups. But despite these changes and limited social familiarity among group members, substantial and predictable behavioural differences between the groups persisted both within and across the different contexts (group-level repeatability): some groups moved consistently faster, more cohesively, showed stronger alignment and/or clearer leadership than other groups. These results suggest that among-group heterogeneity could be a widespread feature in animal societies. Future work that considers grouplevel variation in collective behaviour may help understand the selective pressures that shape how animal collectives form and function.","10.1098/rspb.2017.2629","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000426469200009","20172629","Manica, Andrea/0000-0003-1895-450X","Manica, Andrea/B-5497-2008",NA,62,503,185,"#000000",NA,""

Some view R as a property of a dataset and a statistic to be interpreted agnostically with respect to mechanism. Others wish to isolate the contributions of `intrinsic' and/or `permanent' individual differences, and draw a distinction between true (intrinsic) and pseudo-repeatability arising from uncontrolled extrinsic effects. This latter view proposes a narrower, more mechanistic interpretation, than the traditional concept of repeatability, but perhaps one that allows stronger evolutionary inference as a consequence (provided analytical pitfalls are successfully avoided). Neither perspective is incorrect, but if we are to avoid confusion and fruitless debate, there is a need for researchers to recognise this dichotomy, and to ensure clarity in relation to how, and why, a particular estimate of R is appropriate in any case.","10.1002/evl3.40","2056-3744",NA,"ISI:000446762700001",NA,NA,NA,NA,63,279,75,"#000000",NA,""

However, few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk avoidance behaviour covary with life-history traits among individuals in natural populations, or how these links vary depending on the context and the way risk aversion is measured. We measured two different risk avoidance behaviours (latency to enter the nest and inspection time) in wild great tits (Parus major) in two different contexts-response to a novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during incubation-and related these behaviours to female reproductive success and condition. Females responded equally strongly to both stimuli, and although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate. Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number of offspring fledged. By contrast, inspection time was directly explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between risk aversion and fitness depend on how risk aversion was measured.

We use a reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which describes variation within an individual through time, and personality, which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored. Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual variation in intercept.

Our objective was to quantify the among-individual correlation (rind) and within-individual correlation (re) between locomotor performance and personality traits in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We repeatedly measured sprint speed, docility, and exploration behaviour and found that all traits were significantly repeatable. Sprint speed was not correlated with docility and time spent in the centre of the open field. However, sprint speed was significantly and negatively correlated with distance moved in the open field at both the among-individual (rind = -0.59) and the within-individual (re = -0.54) levels. Thus, individuals with high locomotor performance are less explorative in a novel environment, which is somewhat counter-intuitive and opposite to the predictions generated by the pace-of-life syndrome and the ``phenotypic compensation{''} hypotheses. Our results suggest that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are co-specialised traits as they can reinforce each other's effects in reducing predation risk. In refuging species such as chipmunks (i.e. individuals have to leave a refuge to forage), low exploration levels may reduce exposure to predators and high sprint speed may further reduce the probability of capture given an encounter with a predator. Thus, looking at how locomotor performance and behaviour interact and contribute to fitness is key to understanding the multivariate architecture of-and co-adaptations among-ecologically relevant complex phenotypes. Significance statement A large number of studies have looked at the relationships between locomotor performance and behaviour at the inter-specific, among-individual, and within-individual levels, with mixed results. We found a significant and negative relationship between sprint speed and distance moved during an open-field test, which goes against the prediction of the pace-of-life syndrome and the ``phenotypic compensation{''} hypotheses. Instead, these results support the Btrait co-specialisation{''} hypothesis. In refuging animals such as chipmunks, reactive behaviours (being shy and less exploratory) may reduce exposure to predators and high sprint speed may further the probability of escaping given an encounter with a predator. Taken all together, the negative among- and within-individual correlations and sensitivity to the same covariates (parasites, and to a less extent body mass) suggest that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are co-adapted in eastern chipmunks.","10.1007/s00265-018-2445-2","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000425418600011","UNSP 27","Careau, Vincent/0000-0002-2826-7837","Careau, Vincent/A-9778-2008",NA,68,602,110,"#000000",NA,""

In particular, changes in water availability during development may initiate a range of behavioral responses, such as natal dispersal, but the contribution of maternal effects from water stress in explaining behavioral variation has been overlooked so far. In this study, we examined behavioral plasticity of juvenile common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) in response to changes in pre-natal and post-natal hydric conditions. We exposed pregnant mothers either to a moderate water restriction or to ad libitum access to water. We used neutral arena tests to measure repeatedly activity and space use behaviors of their offspring, either in dry or wet soil conditions, at two distinct life stages (juveniles and yearlings) in order to quantify behavioral flexibility, age differences, and personalities (consistent inter-individual differences). Juveniles and yearlings had greater exploration scores in dry than wet conditions regardless of the pre-natal conditions. Pre-natal water restriction and dry post-natal conditions enhanced thigmotaxis (i.e., a behavior related to anxiety) in juveniles. Maternal environment did not influence behavioral flexibility nor the behavior of yearlings. Behaviors were barely repeatable in juveniles and inconsistent through early life. Assuming that dry conditions may initiate flight responses, these results suggest complex relationships between the developmental timing of water stress, exploration and anxiety behaviors, and dispersal syndromes. Significance statement Water restriction should initiate a range of behaviors related to a flight response. However, there is little evidence that changes in water availability across development influence offspring behavior in wild animals. Experiments with lizards demonstrate that maternal water restriction increased the anxiety of their juveniles, whereas their exploration was higher in dry environments. Thus, water availability may be a critical determinant of space use behavior and dispersal syndromes.","10.1007/s00265-018-2443-4","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000425418600010","UNSP 23",NA,NA,NA,69,651,210,"#000000",NA,""

This inequality in parental contribution is reduced when offspring survival is dependent on biparental care. However, this idea has received little empirical attention.

We performed parental care assays on 8 (n = 8 males, 8 females) mated pairs repeatedly over a 10-week period (i.e., 5-15 weeks of litter age) when pairs were first-time breeders (2011), and again as experienced breeders (2013). We quantified consistent individual variation (i.e., repeatability) in 8 care behaviors and examined within-and among-individual correlations to determine if behavioral plasticity within or parental personality across seasons varied by sex. Finally, we extracted hormone metabolites (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) from fecal samples collected during gestation to describe potential links between hormonal mechanisms and individual consistency in parental behaviors. Parents differed in which behaviors were repeatable: mothers demonstrated consistency in provisioning and pup-directed aggression, whereas fathers were consistent in pup checks. However, positive within-individual correlations for identical behaviors (e.g., maternal versus paternal play) suggested that the rate of change in all behaviors except provisioning was highly correlated between the sexes. Moreover, positive among-individual correlations among 50\% of identical behaviors suggested that personality differences across parents were highly correlated. Lastly, negative among-individual correlations among pup-directed aggression, provisioning, and gestational testosterone in both sexes demonstrated potential links between preparental hormones and labile parental traits.

Verbal models of individual stress coping style have proposed that the behavioural component of this variation can be described as a single axis, with each individual's coping style being consistent across time and stress contexts. Focusing on this behavioural component of stress response and combining repeated measures of multiple traits with a novel multivariate modelling framework, we test for the existence of coping style variation and assess its stability across contexts in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we test the following hypotheses: (1) there exists repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation (personality) within a mild stress context consistent with a risk-averse-risk-prone continuum of behavioural coping style, (2) there is population-level plasticity in behaviour as a function of stressor severity, (3) there is among-individual variation in plasticity (i.e. IxE), and (4) the presence of IxE reduces cross-context stability of behavioural coping style. We found significant repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation in the mild stress context (open field trial), represented as an I matrix. However, I was not readily described by a simple risk-averse-risk-prone continuum as posited by the original coping style model. We also found strong evidence for population-level changes in mean behaviour with increasing stressor severity (simulated avian and piscine predation risks). Single-trait analyses did show the presence of individual-by-environment interactions (IxE), as among-individual cross-context correlations were significantly less than +1. However, multitrait analysis revealed the consequences of this plasticity variation were minimal. Specifically, we found little evidence for changes in the structure of I between mild and moderate stress contexts overall, and only minor changes between the two moderate contexts (avian vs. piscine predator). We show that a multivariate approach to assessing changes in among-individual (co)variance across contexts can prevent the over-interpretation of statistically significant, but small, individual-by-environment effects. While behavioural flexibility enables populations (and individuals) to respond rapidly to changes in the environment, multivariate personality structure can be conserved strongly across such contexts.

An alternative means of detecting pain may be recognition of behavioral changes in ridden horses. It has been demonstrated that there are differences in facial expressions in nonlame and lame horses. The purpose of this study was to develop a whole horse ethogram for ridden horses and to determine whether it could be applied repeatedly by 1 observer (repeatability study, 9 horses) and if, by application of a related pain behavior score, lame horses (n = 24) and nonlame horses (n = 13) could be differentiated. It was hypothesized that there would be some overlap in pain behavior scores among nonlame and lame horses; and that overall, nonlame horses would have a lower pain behavior score than lame horses. The ethogram was developed with 117 behavioral markers, and the horses were graded twice in random order by a trained specialist using video footage. Overall, there was a good correlation between the 2 assessments (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.91). Behavioral markers that were not consistent across the 2 assessments were omitted, reducing the ethogram to 70 markers. The modified ethogram was applied to video recordings of the nonlame horses and lame horses (ethogram evaluation). There was a strong correlation between 20 behavioral markers and the presence of lameness. The ethogram was subsequently simplified to 24 behavioral markers, by the amalgamation of similar behaviors which scored similarly and by omission of markers which showed unreliable results in relation to lameness. Following this, the maximum individual occurrence score for lame horses was 14 (out of 24 possible markers), with a median and mean score of 9 (+/- 2 standard deviation) compared with a maximum score of 6 for nonlame horses, with a median and mean score of 2 (+/- 1.4). For lame horses, the following behaviors occurred significantly more (P < 0.05, chi-square): ears back, mouth opening, tongue out, change in eye posture and expression, going above the bit, head tossing, tilting the head, unwillingness to go, crookedness, hurrying, changing gait spontaneously, poor quality canter, resisting, and stumbling and toe dragging. Recognition of these features as potential indicators of musculoskeletal pain may enable earlier recognition of lameness and avoidance of punishment-based training. Further research is necessary to verify this new ethogram for assessment of pain in ridden horses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Wild young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon were captured from habitats of varying physical complexity and placed into semi-natural stream enclosures for 11 days while their behaviour was observed and tested in both open and structurally complex environments. We found evidence for personality, or consistent individual behavioural differences across contexts, for avoidance and site attachment, with repeatabilities of 0.287 and 0.206, respectively, but not for activity or frequency of aggression. Fish were significantly more active and aggressive in the open habitats, and more site-attached in the complex habitats. Active and aggressive fish also grew more in the wild, while site-attached fish grew less in the wild, but more in the enclosures. However, contrary to our expectation, the complexity of the original habitat was not a significant predictor of personality.

Knowledge of whether personality is heritable, and to what degree it is influenced by the social environment, is crucial to understanding its evolutionary significance, yet few estimates are available from natural populations. We tracked three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in adult boldness. We did not detect maternal effects on any traits, but we did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness, exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a behavioural syndrome, suggesting that selection could act independently on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that social context influences personality traits. Future efforts could separate whether personality traits differ in heritability because they have served specific functional roles in the evolution of the phenotype or because our concept of personality and the stability of behaviour needs to be revised.","10.1111/jeb.13197","1010-061X","1420-9101","ISI:000419307000007",NA,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182 Burke, Terry/0000-0003-3848-1244 Schroeder, Julia/0000-0002-4136-843X Simons, Mirre/0000-0001-7406-7708 Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo/0000-0002-2886-0649 Hsu, Yu-Hsun/0000-0002-0233-5045 Winney, Isabel/0000-0001-8606-3720","Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011 Burke, Terry/B-3196-2011 Schroeder, Julia/B-1436-2010 ",NA,77,265,462,"#000000",NA,""

The evolution of competitive ability, in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits. The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i) whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.","10.1111/evo.13398","0014-3820","1558-5646","ISI:000419245400014",NA,"Rosenthal, Gil/0000-0003-0342-9024","Rosenthal, Gil/E-6924-2015",NA,78,441,484,"#000000",NA,""

Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological environment, which could explain variation in fitness. 2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. 3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.","10.1111/1365-2656.12773","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000417935100012",NA,NA,NA,NA,79,41,90,"#000000",NA,""

Group-living is widespread among animals and comes with numerous costs and benefits. To date, research examining group-living has focused on trade-offs surrounding foraging, while other forms of resource acquisition have been largely overlooked. 2. Air-breathing has evolved in many fish lineages, allowing animals to obtain oxygen in hypoxic aquatic environments. Breathing air increases the threat of predation, so some species perform group air-breathing, to reduce individual risk. Within species, individual air-breathing can be influenced by metabolic rate as well as personality, but the mechanisms of group air-breathing remain unexplored. It is conceivable that keystone individuals with high metabolic demand or intrinsic tendency to breathe air may drive social breathing, especially in hypoxia. 3. We examined social air-breathing in African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus, to determine whether individual physiological traits and spontaneous tendency to breathe air influence the behaviour of entire groups, and whether such influences vary in relation to aquatic oxygen availability. 4. We studied 11 groups of four catfish in a laboratory arena and recorded air-breathing behaviour, activity and agonistic interactions at varying levels of hypoxia. Bimodal respirometry was used to estimate individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and the tendency to utilize aerial oxygen when alone. 5. Fish took more air breaths in groups as compared to when they were alone, regardless of water oxygen content, and displayed temporally clustered air-breathing behaviour, consistent with existing definitions of synchronous air-breathing. However, groups displayed tremendous variability in surfacing behaviour. Aggression by dominant individuals within groups was the main factor influencing air-breathing of the entire group. There was no association between individual SMR, or the tendency to obtain oxygen from air when in isolation, and group air-breathing. 6. For C. gariepinus, synchronous air-breathing is strongly influenced by agonistic interactions, which may expose subordinate individuals to risk of predation. Influential individuals exerted an overriding effect on risk-taking by the entire group, for reasons independent of their physiological oxygen requirements. Overall, this illustrates that social context can obscure interactions between an individual's physiological and behavioural traits and their tendency to take risks to obtain resources.","10.1111/1365-2656.12758","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000417935100021",NA,"Esbaugh, Andrew/0000-0002-7262-4408 Killen, Shaun/0000-0003-4949-3988","Esbaugh, Andrew/N-4452-2017 ",NA,80,32,446,"#000000",NA,""

Our laboratory recently developed a paradigm to measure the reinforcing value of food versus an alternative behavior (i.e., playing with bubbles) in infants using a computerized laboratory task, during which infants press a button to earn reinforcers following a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the short-term (within 2 weeks) repeatability of this measure, specifically the outcome of infant food reinforcing ratio (FRR), or how hard infants will work for food relative to the alternative. The secondary aim was to examine whether infant age and temperament dimensions related to novelty responsiveness (high intensity pleasure and approach) moderated the repeatability of FRR. Thirty-seven infants aged 9-18 months completed this study. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no differences between time 1 and time 2 in responding for food (F = 0.463, p = 0.501), bubbles (F = 1.793, p = 0.189), or overall FRR (F = 0.797, p = 0.378).

However, little work explores the fitness consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level, and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly, average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of predator-prey interactions.","10.1038/s41598-017-18359-x","2045-2322",NA,"ISI:000418644100022","18063",NA,NA,NA,82,332,178,"#000000",NA,""

Answering this question requires establishing the mix of intrinsic and contextual factors that contribute to social isolation. Using social network data spanning up to half of the median adult lifespan in a gregarious primate, we found that some measures of social isolation were modestly repeatable within individuals, consistent with a trait. By contrast, social isolation was not explained by the identity of an animal's mother or the group into which it was born. Nevertheless, age, sex and social status each played a role, as did kin dynamics and familiarity. Females with fewer close relatives were more isolated, and the more time males spent in a new group the less isolated they became, independent of their social status. These results show that social isolation results from a combination of intrinsic and environmental factors. From an evolutionary perspective, these findings suggest that social isolation could be adaptive in some contexts and partly maintained by selection.","10.1038/s41598-017-18104-4","2045-2322",NA,"ISI:000418359600041","17791",NA,NA,NA,83,394,394,"#000000",NA,""

It has long been suggested that these traits co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study, we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e. activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing. Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between metabolism and growth.","10.1242/jeb.167783","0022-0949","1477-9145","ISI:000417822800021",NA,"Fu, Shi-Jian/0000-0001-7665-9037",NA,NA,84,199,38,"#405d99","selected","multiple behaviours"

Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations.

In social contexts, animal behaviour is often studied in terms of group-level characteristics. One clear example of this is the collective motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to experimental data. 2. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each case. 3. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level repeatability of the underlying traits. 4. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals. Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments, and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence social behaviour.","10.1111/2041-210X.12813","2041-210X","2041-2096","ISI:000417239200010",NA,NA,NA,NA,86,40,77,"#000000",NA,""

Theories of partner selection and quantitative genetics assume that phenotypic resemblance of partners captures associations in intrinsically determined trait values. However, when considering traits with a repeatability below one (labile traits or traits measured with error), the correlation between phenotypes of paired individuals can arise from shared environmental effects on the phenotypes of paired individuals or correlated measurement error. We introduce statistical approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits or traits measured with error in the presence of shared environmental effects. These approaches include (1) the correlation between the mean phenotypes of males and females, (2) the correlation between randomized values of individuals and (3) the between-pair correlation derived from a bivariate mixed model. We use simulations to show that the performance of these different approaches depends on the number of repeated measures within individuals or pairs, which is determined by study design, and rates of survival and divorce. We conclude that short-term environmental effects on phenotypes of paired individuals likely inflate estimates of assortative mating when not statistically accounted for. Our approach allows investigation of this important issue in assortative mating studies for labile traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology, or metabolism) in both socially monogamous and other mating systems, and groupings of individuals outside a mating context.","10.1111/2041-210X.12837","2041-210X","2041-2096","ISI:000417239200027",NA,"Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612","Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008",NA,87,20,73,"#000000",NA,""

Stress responses nevertheless vary based on the type of stress, its duration, magnitude, and the organism's physiological status.

The two stress types applied were short-term cold stress and long-term low protein stress. The behavioral response variables were movement activity, preference to move along the test arena edges, latency to emerge from shelter, and preference for dark microhabitat, measured at two stages of the beetles' lives, as young adults after eclosion and one month later. Behavioral responses were stress-specific. Cold-stressed beetles moved over the longest distances but were also the most reluctant to leave an accessible shelter. We interpret this to mean that cold-stressed beetles were the most active under unfavorable conditions and least bold under more favorable, protected conditions. As beetles aged, their movement activity decreased and latency to emerge from shelter increased. Non-stressed beetles were the most consistent in their behavior across all behavioral tests. This finding is similar to those in previous studies and suggests that moderate stress reduces behavioral consistency. While all beetles gained mass during the study period, the two stress types led to different patterns of body mass increase, which was more moderate for cold stressed than for protein-stressed beetles.","10.1016/j.beproc.2017.10.008","0376-6357","1872-8308","ISI:000416617200014",NA,NA,NA,NA,88,172,134,"#000000",NA,""

However, little is known about the causes of variation in the repeatability of behavioral differences among species because rarely have comparative studies been undertaken to examine the repeatability of behavioral differences among individuals within their natural ecological settings. Using two species of endemic subtropical anemonefishes, Amphiprion mccullochi and A. latezonatus at Lord Howe and North Solitary Islands, Australia, we conducted an in situ comparative analysis of personality traits, examining the repeatability of boldness, sociability and aggression as well as the potential role of environmental and social factors on behavioral expression. For A. mccullochi, only boldness and aggression were highly repeatable and these behaviors formed a behavioral syndrome. For A. latezonatus, none of the three behaviors were repeatable due to low-inter-individual variation in behavior. We suggest that the harsher and more variable environmental and social conditions experienced by A. latezonatus have resulted in reduced repeatability in behavior, in contrast to A. mccullochi which typically inhabits a more stable lagoonal reef environment. Additionally, group size and size rank, rather than nearest-neighbor distance and anemone size, influenced the expression of these behaviors in both species, suggesting that behavioral variation was more sensitive to social than environmental factors. Overall, differences in repeatability between these closely related species likely reflect adaptations to contrasting environmental and social conditions, although alternative explanations must be considered. The differences in behavioral consistency between these two endemic anemonefishes could lead to disparity in their resilience to environmental or social change in the future.","10.1007/s00338-017-1625-2","0722-4028","1432-0975","ISI:000415691300031",NA,"Whalan, Steve/0000-0001-6786-8945 Scott, Anna/0000-0001-6894-8808",NA,NA,90,543,206,"#000000",NA,""

Six potential personality traits (within-flock activity, ability to escape, response to threat, isolation calling, boldness and neophobia) and dominance were measured four times in 96 domestic canaries Serinus canaria (48 males and 48 females): twice during a long photoperiod (Long Days) and 6months later twice during a short photoperiod (Short Days). Without regard to sex and photoperiod, most traits were highly repeatable, and bolder canaries were more dominant, less sensitive to an external threat and to isolation and less neophobic. In addition, the more active individuals within a flock were the more difficult to catch. Yet, both sex and photoperiod affected personality traits and behavioural profiles. Personality traits remained repeatable within each photoperiod though we observed behavioural plasticity and sex differences for response to threat, neophobia and within-flock activity. Concerning behavioural profiles, the negative relationship between boldness and neophobia remained homogenous in both sexes during Short Days as well as during Long Days. Then, the more active individuals within a flock were the more difficult to catch in Short Days but not in Long Days. Finally, the other correlations not only varied with photoperiod but also with sex. Our study highlights the importance of photoperiod and sex in the expression of personality traits and behavioural profiles, and of the need to measure them across the whole photoperiodic cycle.","10.1111/eth.12662","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000414867800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,91,426,662,"#000000",NA,""

To test this hypothesis, we used juvenile common-garden reared carp (Cyprinus carpio) within a narrow size range to investigate the mechanistic basis of behavioral selection caused by angling. We focused on one key personality trait (i.e., boldness), measured in groups within ponds, two morphological traits (body shape and head shape), and one life-history trait (juvenile growth capacity) and studied mean standardized selection gradients caused by angling. Carp behavior was highly repeatable within ponds. In the short term, over seven days of fishing, total length, not boldness, was the main predictor of angling vulnerability. However, after 20 days of fishing, boldness turned out to be the main trait under selection, followed by juvenile growth rate, while morphological traits were only weakly related to angling vulnerability. In addition, we found juvenile growth rate to be moderately correlated with boldness. Hence, direct selection on boldness will also induce indirect selection on juvenile growth and vice versa, but given that the two traits are not perfectly correlated, independent evolution of both traits is also possible. Our study is among the first to mechanistically reveal that energy-acquisition-related behaviors, and not growth rate per se, are key factors determining the probability of capture, and hence, behavioral traits appear to be the prime targets of angling selection. We predict an evolutionary response toward increased shyness in intensively angling-exploited fish stocks, possibly causing the emergence of a timidity syndrome.","10.1111/eva.12504","1752-4571",NA,"ISI:000414952000004",NA,"Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X",NA,NA,92,631,354,"#000000",NA,""

Such effects are often more strongly expressed when individuals are simultaneously exposed to other stress sources. Consequently, the behaviour of virgin and mated individuals often differs. Mated females, for example, search for suitable oviposition sites, whereas virgin females search more for mates. In the present study, we examine the effect of mating separately for females and males on four key behaviours of the red flour beetles: movement activity, movement along the edges of an arena, latency to emerge from shelter and preference for dark microhabitat. After mating, both sexes increase their activity at the same time as moving less along the arena edge, leading to a change in movement pattern. Females possibly change their movement pattern to locate suitable oviposition sites, whereas males perhaps do so to detect additional females with which to mate. Latency to emerge from shelter and dark preference are not influenced by mating, although they increase when measured again after 1week. Of these behaviours, only movement activity is consistent at the individual level. We also examine whether mating incurs a cost as expressed in the time required to recover from a chill-coma. The latter is a common proxy of cold tolerance in ectotherms. By contrast to our prediction, mating has no effect on chill-coma recovery time, suggesting that either a single mating event does not incur sufficient stress or that there is possibly no trade-off between the energetic cost of mating and of cold tolerance.","10.1111/phen.12195","0307-6962","1365-3032","ISI:000414567800002",NA,NA,NA,NA,93,356,451,"#000000",NA,""

State-dependence theory suggests that behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition, gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments. Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural predictability, but not in behavioural type.","10.1371/journal.pone.0187657","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000414572100030","e0187657","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011",NA,94,210,71,"#000000",NA,""

We used individual-based monitoring data from 98 GPS-collared brown bears in Scandinavia to estimate diel activity patterns before the fall hunting season. We extracted 7 activity measures related to timing and regularity of activity from individual activity profiles. We then used multivariate analysis to test for the existence of distinct activity tactics and their environmental determinants, followed by generalized linear regression to estimate the extent of within-individual repeatability of activity tactics. We detected 4 distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods. We did not find evidence of diel activity tactics influencing survival during the subsequent hunting season. We conclude that individual variation in activity deserves greater attention than it currently receives, as it may help account for individual heterogeneity in fitness and could facilitate within-population niche partitioning that can have population-or community-level consequences.","10.1093/beheco/arx122","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000415675000015",NA,NA,NA,NA,95,10,255,"#000000",NA,""

In this study, we used social networks to examine variation in individual social behaviour in wild Grant's gazelles, Nanger granti, and explored potential drivers and consequences of this variation. First, we quantified two aspects of individual network position (weighted degree and closeness) on a monthly basis for 12 consecutive months and examined life-history (age) and abiotic (rainfall) factors that could explain among-individual variation in network position. Next, we examined the level of within-individual repeatability in network position over time. We then tested for potential consequences of this variation focusing on parasite infection and diet quality. Rainfall and age were strong predictors of variation in closeness but not degree. Interestingly, we found that one aspect of individual network position (closeness) varied over time, while another (degree) was moderately repeatable. The difference in within-individual repeatability of the two measures may be explained by the dependence of closeness on rainfall. In addition, we found that individual network position had consequences for both parasitism and diet, but the magnitude and direction of these effects depended on parasite type, connectivity measure and environmental conditions. Overall, our results suggest that environmental and host factors strongly influence variability in certain aspects of social connectivity in Grant's gazelles, and that abiotic and biotic forces, together, mediate the consequences of social network position.

The objective of this study was to investigate reliability and validity aspects of four selected behavioural measures at the feeding gate (BM) and to compare them with existing breeding traits and with observations of cows' behaviour during milking. This included the analysis of criterion validity at animal and at herd level and of repeatability of the BM over time. Data on avoidance distances (AD), tolerance to tactile interaction (TTI), release behaviour (RB), and qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were collected on a total of 33 dairy farms. The breeding traits average milk flow (AMF), milking speed (MS), and milking temperament (MT) had been recorded per test-day or during linear description by milk testing or breeding associations. Inter- and intra-test associations were investigated by Spearman rank or Pearson correlation analysis. At animal level, significant correlations of different strengths were found within BM ranging from r(s) = 0.28 (p < 0.01, n = 1890) between AD and TTI to r(s) = 0.74 (p < 0.01, n = 582) between RB and QBA, and between MS and MT (rs = 0.62, p < 0.01, n = 269). No significant correlations were found between BM and breeding traits. For analyses at herd level, medians and percentages of certain categories were calculated and the average number of stepping (STEP) and kicking (KICK) per cow during milking was recorded. Between all BM closer correlations were found than at animal level. STEP correlated with KICK (r(s) = 0.80, p < 0.01, n = 24), while no further significant correlations were found between BM, STEP or KICK and breeding traits. For analysis of repeatability BM were applied repeatedly on three farms following a three-week interval. Correlations ranged from r(s) = 0.33 (p < 0.01, n = 67) for TTI to r(s) = 0.73 (p < 0.01, n = 23) for QBA. Apparently, behavioural measures at the feeding gate reflect partly similar and partly different aspects of cows' responsiveness towards humans. The present study underlines methodological problems that exist with MT and MS, and questions the relationship between milkability, milking behaviour and responsiveness in the barn. The analyses show that AD, TTI, and RB appear to be vulnerable to short- or mid-term influences. Overall, QBA turned out to be a promising measure for breeding and welfare assessment.","10.1016/j.applanim.2017.07.006","0168-1591","1872-9045","ISI:000413795800003",NA,NA,NA,NA,97,281,564,"#000000",NA,""

We investigated size, energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout. In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1 month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by recapture probability), but no significant differences between food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments. For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk. Significance statement In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab, but not realized in natural streams.","10.1007/s00265-017-2395-0","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000413741000001","UNSP 165",NA,NA,NA,98,393,370,"#000000",NA,""

Using a population of dunnocks (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age. Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as `personality'. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of personality-mediated speciation.

Subsequently, two observers blinded to the identity of records each analysed the video clips three times with the software Interact in intervals of 1-2 days between viewings. Frequency and duration of behaviour patterns such as head movement, tail flicking or defecation were recorded. In addition, each behaviour pattern was assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) and in the end of each observation an overall behaviour score on a numerical scale from 1 to 5 and on a VAS was assigned to each animal. Using variance components from mixed model analysis, results revealed that both inter- and intra-observer reliability (OR) were similar or superior for the majority of behaviour patterns when assessed with the VAS compared to the more time-consuming assessment of exact frequencies and durations (e.g. Intra-OR `tail flicking': Observer I: r(VAS) = 0.83 and r(Freq), = 0.26; Observer II: r(VAS) = 0.91, r(Freq) = 0.37 and r(Dur) = 0.87 for the tethering test; Inter-OR `body movement': r(VAS) = 0.81 and r(Freq) = 0.33 for the crush test).

However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length, mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25) that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of information can be conveyed to the receivers. Significance statement We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because individuals that changed residency between days sang with less consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers.","10.1007/s00265-017-2379-0","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000413565500005","UNSP 154","CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Zsebok, Sandor/0000-0003-4463-4753 Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Zsebok, Sandor/H-4768-2015 Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,103,533,189,"#000000",NA,""

For anadromous fishes requiring access to spawning habitat above obstructions, successful passage at fishways may at least in part be a function of an individual's behavioural type. The objectives of this study were to determine whether distinct behavioural typesbold and shycould be distinguished within a population of anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and, if so, whether passage success at a nature-like fishway varied relative to behavioural type. Field-caught rainbow smelt were tested for individual differences in boldness (i.e., willingness to engage in risk-taking behaviour) using the metrics of exploratory behaviour, general activity, and response to a simulated predator. After testing, 276 rainbow smelt were implanted with a passive integrated transponder tag, released below the fishway, and their movements monitored via a stationary antenna array. The results of our behavioural assays indicated the presence of a behavioural syndrome among rainbow smelt, and that behaviour was partially repeatable. In total, 41.7\% of fish entering the fishway passed successfully, but contrary to our initial prediction, boldness was not a significant predictor of successful passage. Instead, increasing water temperature and decreasing river discharge were consistent predictors of successful passage and greater distances moved through the fishway. Our findings indicate that the nature-like fishway did not select for a particular behavioural type and that individuals representing the spectrum of bold-shy behavioural types could pass.","10.1002/rra.3176","1535-1459","1535-1467","ISI:000412518100003",NA,"Wilson, Alexander/0000-0002-7696-1671",NA,NA,105,239,269,"#000000",NA,""

The population from a high-flow and high-predation habitat was significantly bolder than populations from low-predation and low-flow/stagnant habitats. Individuals were significantly bolder in the presence of shoal and predators than in the other contexts. In general, males were significantly bolder than females. Smaller individuals took greater risks to feed than larger individuals only within two populations. The high-predation, high-flow habitat fish also showed significantly lower between- and within-individual variation in boldness than all the low-predation and low-flow populations. Furthermore, we found significantly repeatable responses across contexts within all populations, indicating behavioral consistency. Differences in response to variations in experimental contexts and stress and individual differences in metabolic rates could possibly explain the observed between- and within-individual variation among populations.","10.1089/zeb.2017.1442","1545-8547","1557-8542","ISI:000412338600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,106,512,150,"#000000",NA,""

We investigated the possible link between personality traits and learning performance in the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops.

Host sociality is known to impact parasite risk with more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2years at a site in southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality.

Despite increasing evidence that highlights their importance {[}5-16], we still lack a unified mechanistic framework to explain and to predict how consistent inter-individual differences may drive collective behavior. Here we investigate how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and foraging performance of groups can emerge from inter-individual differences by high-resolution tracking of known behavioral types in free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) shoals. We show that individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a classic ``sociability'' assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a range of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership within groups as well as differences in structure and movement dynamics between groups. In turn, this trait, together with individual's exploratory tendency, measured by a classic ``boldness'' assay, explained individual and group foraging performance. These effects of consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of individuals differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain the emergence of collective behavior from consistent individual differences, including variation in the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups, across social and ecological scales. In addition, we demonstrate individual performance is conditional on group composition, indicating how social selection may drive behavioral differentiation between individuals.","10.1016/j.cub.2017.08.004","0960-9822","1879-0445","ISI:000411581800034",NA,"Couzin, Iain/0000-0001-8556-4558 Manica, Andrea/0000-0003-1895-450X Jolles, Jolle/0000-0001-9905-2633","Couzin, Iain/Q-6862-2018 Manica, Andrea/B-5497-2008 ",NA,109,131,193,"#000000",NA,""

The recording of slow pupillary oscillations in complete darkness is a promising approach for objective evaluation of daytime sleepiness at the physiological level. The aim of the present study was to analyze the magnitude of between-and within-subject variation of the pupillary unrest index (PUI) in a sample of healthy individuals. Materials and methods. The present data were collected within the framework of a mobile phone study on possible effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on the central nervous system. Pupillary behavior was monitored in 30 young healthy male volunteers (age 18-30 years) on ten non-consecutive experimental days at 11: 00 a.m. and 04:00 p.m., using infrared video pupillography (compact integrated pupillograph, CIP). Since RF-EMF had no impact on the PUI, data were pooled for the present analysis. Results. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed that the PUI was subject to higher interindividual variation as compared to intraindividual variation at both times of measurement. This resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients pointing to a substantial stability of these interindividual differences. A comparison of the PUI results with currently used cutoff values revealed that more than 50\% of recordings from young, healthy, non-sleep-disturbed males showed values beyond the ``normal{''} range. Conclusion. The significant interindividual variability implies that the PUI is not only a state marker. Evaluations of such measurements should therefore consider the PUI as a possible trait marker to ensure comparability and correct interpretation.","10.1007/s11818-017-0128-2","1432-9123","1439-054X","ISI:000415856700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,110,325,7,"#993f3f","excluded","human"

Recent work combining animal personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels relative to those with slower life history strategies, but empirical tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials. Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors, such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges.

A more nutritious diet, i.e., young leaves, had beneficial consequences on larval growth. Contrary to findings on adults, the behaviour of larvae was neither consistent over time nor across contexts, thus larvae did not show personality. Furthermore, larval behaviour was shaped independent of the diet, pointing to a stage-dependent receptivity towards diet conditions in this species. Besides, larval activity was significantly influenced by former test experience, with naive larvae being more active than previously tested larvae. In general, in insects memories in an olfactory or sexual behaviour context can lead to behavioural responses later in life. Mechanisms of memory-learning should be further explored in different contexts in insects.

Environmental change may nevertheless lead individuals to relocate to another site, although such relocations can be energetically costly or risky. Temperature and illumination are two important factors that undergo change in seasonal and daily cycles that may impact habitat quality. Animals must therefore either acclimate to the new conditions or relocate. Wormlions are sit-and-wait, trap-building predators whose success in foraging is highly dependent on their surroundings. Here, we manipulated temperature (high, low, and moderate) and let the wormlions choose between lit and shaded conditions. We found that the typical wormlion preference for shaded microhabitats decreased with increasing temperature. We then followed wormlion behavior under a fullfactorial design of two constant illumination conditions (light vs. shade) and three temperatures. Although both constant light and high temperature reduced foraging performance, expressed in pit construction tendency and pit area, the two conditions had a non-additive effect. Acclimation to extreme thermal conditions moderated the negative effects of such temperatures, expressed in a higher tendency to construct a pit, and equalized performance across temperatures. Finally, the high temperature reduced behavioral consistency while acclimation increased it, suggesting that consistency is impaired by unfavorable environmental change. To conclude, while an environmental change usually affects several environmental factors simultaneously, the induced behavioral change is neither synergic nor additive and can even differ from the response to each unfavorable environmental factor in isolation. Significance statement Choosing a suitable habitat is essential for survival and reproduction, especially for sedentary organisms, and requires the consideration of various environmental conditions. Acclimating to suboptimal conditions, however, might conduce to improving performance in a less suitable habitat. Testing the effect of several environmental conditions on habitat choice and foraging behavior, before and after acclimation, has rarely been carried out. Here, we tested the combined effects of temperature, illumination, and their interaction, on habitat choice and foraging performance of a sit-and-wait predator, the wormlion. Wormlions usually prefer shade, but their preference for light increases with decreasing temperature. Both temperature and illumination affect behavior but their joint effect is not additive. Acclimation, which took place for temperature but not for illumination, improved certain foraging behaviors. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating several environmental conditions and behaviors when studying habitat choice and foraging behavior.","10.1007/s00265-017-2362-9","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000410477800006","UNSP 137",NA,NA,NA,115,595,29,"#993f3f","excluded","unclear"

Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny. The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However, the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare. Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation, albeit at different time points in males and females.

Repeatability represents a key parameter in ecological and evolutionary research. Repeatability is underpinned by developmental plasticity and genetic variation but may become biased upwards by repeatable differences in environments to which individuals respond plastically. The extent of upward bias caused by the latter mechanism (causing ``pseudo-repeatability{''}) is important yet rarely investigated in ecological research. 2. We repeatedly assayed a key behaviour (flight initiation distance) affecting longevity in a wild cricket population (Gryllus campestris). We used naturally moving, translocated and forced-stationary individuals to study bias in repeatability caused by spatial variability in environmental conditions. 3. Our experiments acknowledged that translocations might themselves bias repeatability estimates if animals respond to handling procedures (a necessary component of translocations). Individuals were, therefore, either (i) repeatedly translocated and assayed or (ii) assayed at multiple burrows as part of natural movements. This enabled estimation of behavioural variance attributable to individual, burrow and residual components within each treatment; comparison across treatments addressed whether translocations caused bias. We also calculated repeatability for individuals that were forced to be stationary to investigate whether this led to upward bias of repeatability. 4. For adult crickets, individual explained 17.8\% versus 17.2\%, and burrow 8.7\% versus 10.3\%, of the behavioural variance in translocated versus natural-movement treatments. Repeatability for forced-stationary adults was 31.1\%, thereby demonstrating experimentally that certain study designs bias repeatability upwards. For translocated juveniles, individual explained 10.0\% and burrow 6.0\% of the variance, while in the natural-movement treatment, those components could not be separated as juveniles do not switch burrows. Translocations did not lead to detectable biases in behavioural mean or variance. 5. Repeatability was not biased for adults subjected to the natural-movement treatment because individuals were assayed under many different environments, facilitating the separation of individual from burrow effects. Upward bias would have occurred with less optimal sampling schemes: if individuals had been assayed repeatedly at the same burrow. We, therefore, recommend that translocation experiments are more commonly applied, particularly in stationary species, to ensure the unbiased estimation of repeatability.","10.1111/1365-2656.12688","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000407320500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,119,312,335,"#000000",NA,""

We found that within- individual variation at the among-dates-within-seasons and among-seasons scale, explained the dominant proportion of phenotypic variation. However, individuals also repeatedly differed in their expression of migration behaviour over the 2 year study duration. 5. These results reveal that diel migration variation occurs primarily due to short- term within-individual flexibility in depth use and diel migration behaviour. However, repeatable individual differences also played a key role in mediating partial diel migration. 6. These findings represent a significant advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms generating the important, yet poorly understood phenomena of partial diel migration. Moreover, given the pervasive occurrence of diel migrations across aquatic taxa, these findings indicate that individual differences have an important, yet previously unacknowledged role in structuring the temporal and vertical dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.","10.1111/1365-2656.12716","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000407320500026",NA,NA,NA,NA,120,388,612,"#000000",NA,""

Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4-10 months, 10 months-3 years, 3-6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; TuckerLewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate ``aggressive personality{''} trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.","10.1371/journal.pone.0183595","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000408693600048","e0183595","Newberry, Ruth/0000-0002-5238-6959 Goold, Conor/0000-0002-9198-0889",NA,NA,122,34,624,"#000000",NA,""

Another important and related question is whether RNs are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and food availability that were repeated in discrete `bursts' of sampling through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time for both temperature (R-slope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses (R-slope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment (R-intercept = 0.83).

One of the declared strengths of these populations are their robust temperament, which has not been described sufficiently to be utilized for breeding purposes. A horse personality questionnaire (HPQ), with grading of 43 behaviourally defined adjectives, was analysed with a factor analysis to condense the temperament of the four Norwegian breeds into main temperamental factors. The analysis consisted of 1018 horses and the respondents was in general handlers or owners of the objective horse. The Fjord horse, the Dole horse and the Nordland/Lyngen shared the same five factors in the analysis; `anxiousness', `agreeableness', `conscientiousness', `openness' and `dominance'. The Norwegian coldblooded trotter shared the same five factors, but in addition had a factor identified as `excitability'. In total, the factors explained a maximum of 44\% of the variance, which is somewhat less than other studies using the HPQ or similar. An expansion of number of adjectives compared to earlier studies, with skewness in which factor they load on to and more non-loading adjectives, could be an explanation of this. The use of HPQ has contributed to simplify the phenotypic landscape, but for future development of assessing temperamental traits for breeding purposes, a horse personality questionnaire is not recommended, as it is probably highly influenced by personal preferences or possible benefits of the owner. The alternative is impartial observers unknown to the horses, demanding a test arena for the horses, where the observers can base their ratings on the horses' performances.","10.1016/j.applanim.2017.03.015","0168-1591","1872-9045","ISI:000407539500009",NA,NA,NA,NA,125,569,498,"#000000",NA,""

The notion that behavioral flexibility facilitates exploitation of urban environments has received mixed support, but recent studies propose that between-individual differences are important. We leverage existing knowledge on three species of orb-web spider (Araneidae, Araneae) whose abundances differ along an urban-rural gradient to test predictions about between-and within-species/individual behavioral variation. We sampled Larinioides sclopetarius from their urban environment, and two species from suburban environments, Zygiella x-notata and Nuctenea umbratica. For each species, we quantified activity in a novel environment and within-species aggression. We analyzed between-and within-individual variation in behavior as well as their repeatability and correlations. As predicted, L. sclopetarius exhibited the highest activity in a novel environment and N. umbratica the lowest. Across all species, males were more aggressive than females and Z. x-notata was the most aggressive, followed by L. sclopetarius and N. umbratica. For all species, between-individual differences in activity and aggressiveness were repeatable; but the two behaviors were not correlated for any species. We next tested how group composition in relation to aggressiveness affects survival in high density conditions. Groups of Z. x-notata consisting of aggressive and tolerant spiders had higher survival rates than groups composed of only aggressive or tolerant individuals. Ultimately, we uncovered a complex pattern of behavioral variation between species as well as between and within individuals and we discuss the relative roles of this variation with respect to adapting to urban environments. Significance statement Urbanization has drastically changed biodiversity patterns. While the majority of species cope poorly with urban habitats, some species flourish in cities. Our understanding of behavioral characteristics that facilitate this exploitation, however, remains poor. We explored between and within species and individual variation in behaviors in ecologically similar orb-weaving spider species whose abundances differ along the urban-rural gradient. We detect both consistent individual differences and plasticity, in individuals' response to a novel environment, suggesting that some degree of flexibility in reaction to novelty may be crucial in an urbanized environment. We also found that variation in aggressiveness type enables survival in high density conditions, conditions typical for urban populations. Urban populations thus exhibit a complex pattern of behavioral flexibility and behavioral stability.","10.1007/s00265-017-2353-x","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000406285200007","UNSP 125",NA,NA,NA,126,168,367,"#000000",NA,""

Although behavioral coding is the most frequently utilized method for assessing primate personality, limitations in current statistical practice prevent researchers' from utilizing the full potential of their coding datasets. These limitations include the use of extensive data aggregation, not modeling biologically relevant sources of individual variance during repeatability estimation, not partitioning between-individual (co)variance prior to modeling personality structure, the misuse of principal component analysis, and an over-reliance upon exploratory statistical techniques to compare personality models across populations, species, and data collection methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for primate personality research designed to address these limitations. Our framework synthesizes recently developed mixed-effects modeling approaches for quantifying behavioral variation with an information-theoretic model selection paradigm for confirmatory personality research. After detailing a multi-step analytic procedure for personality assessment and model comparison, we employ this framework to evaluate seven models of personality structure in zoo-housed bonobos (Pan paniscus). We find that differences between sexes, ages, zoos, time of observation, and social group composition contributed to significant behavioral variance. Independently of these factors, however, personality nonetheless accounted for a moderate to high proportion of variance in average behavior across observational periods. A personality structure derived from past rating research receives the strongest support relative to our model set. This model suggests that personality variation across the measured behavioral traits is best described by two correlated but distinct dimensions reflecting individual differences in affiliation and sociability (Agreeableness) as well as activity level, social play, and neophilia toward non-threatening stimuli (Openness). These results underscore the utility of our framework for quantifying personality in primates and facilitating greater integration between the behavioral ecological and comparative psychological approaches to personality research.","10.1002/ajp.22670","0275-2565","1098-2345","ISI:000405690200006","e22670","Martin, Jordan/0000-0001-8704-6076",NA,NA,127,412,61,"#000000",NA,""

To experimentally manipulate the amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social interactions significantly influenced helping propensities.

Upon identifying stable and covarying behavioral and endocrine traits, we test the hypothesis that risk-averse personalities exhibit a neuroendocrine stress axis that is systemically potentiated characterized by stronger glucocorticoid reactivity and weaker negative feedback. We show high among-individual variation and covariation (i.e. personality) in risk-taking behaviors and demonstrate that four aspects of glucocorticoid physiology (baseline, stress response, negative feedback strength and adrenal sensitivity) are also repeatable and covary. Further, we establish that high expression of mineralocorticoid and low expression of glucocorticoid receptor in the brain are linked with systemically elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels and more risk-averse personalities.

A lack of detailed genetic information for wild populations has perpetuated assumptions regarding associations between individual differences in tool use and cognition and learning processes. However, captive birds and mammals can use tools in the absence of opportunities for social learning, indicating a genetic basis. Here, we used animal models and relatedness analysis to disentangle the role played by genetics and learning in tool use in an insular population of a long- lived vulture, Neophron percnopterus. Our results show a low heritability in this behaviour, perhaps because of the low variability observed among birds. However, not all individuals used stones to break eggs, and those that did so behaved consistently. Importantly, there was no evidence of learning at the timescale considered. Our results suggest that repeatability in tool use within individuals may indicate a link with some personality traits, with strong evolutionary and ecological consequences.

Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality.

We investigated the nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing support for the honest signalling hypothesis.

Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed.

An individual's foraging behaviour and time allocated to feeding have direct consequences for its fitness. Despite much research on population-level foraging decisions, few studies have investigated individual differences in fine-scale daily foraging patterns among wild animals. 2. Here, we explore the consistency and plasticity of feeding tactics of individual great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), using a grid of 65 automated feeding stations in a 385-ha woodland, during three winters. We use a principal component analysis to describe individual variation in six feeding parameters and examine how these differences covary with dominance-linked attributes (species, age and sex), the personality trait `exploration behaviour', distance to territory and local competition intensity. 3. Analysis of 933 086 feeder visits by 3134 individuals revealed that the majority of variation in the timing of feeding was explained by two principal components. PC1 ('binge-eating'), accounting for 38\% of variation, captured temporal clustering of feeding, with high repeatability both within and between years (r range: 0.42-0.55). PC2 ('transience'), accounting for 27\% of variance, described how much individuals used feeders and was also repeatable (r: 0.34-0.62). While exhibiting consistent individual differences, birds also showed flexibility in foraging patterns, binge-eating less and using feeders more when they experienced greater local competition. 4. Individuals in behaviourally dominant states (great tits, males and adults) binged more than subordinate birds (blue tits, females and juveniles) when their territories were distant from feeding stations. Moreover, great tits and males used feeders more than blue tits and females respectively, while birds feeding further from their territory used feeders less than those feeding closer. `Exploration behaviour' was unrelated to both measures of daily foraging behaviour. 5. This study presents some of the first evidence that birds use consistent alternative foraging tactics at a fine temporal scale. Individuals are consistent in their tactics, and also adjust their foraging behaviour with changes in local competition. Hence, studies of foraging behaviour should consider the extent to which such individual-level variability in foraging behaviour is under selection.","10.1111/1365-2656.12651","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000403146400012",NA,"Sheldon, Ben/0000-0002-5240-7828",NA,NA,133,628,179,"#000000",NA,""

The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis is an extended concept of the life-history theory that includes behavioural traits. The studies challenging the POLS hypothesis often focus on the relationships between a single personality trait and a physiological and/or life-history trait. While pathogens represent a major selective pressure, few studies have been interested in testing relationships between behavioural syndrome, and several fitness components including immunity. 2. The aim of this study was to address this question in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a model species in immunity studies. The personality score was estimated from a multidimensional syndrome based of four repeatable behavioural traits. 3. In a first experiment, we investigated its relationship with two measures of fitness (reproduction and survival) and three components of the innate immunity (haemocyte concentration, and levels of activity of the phenoloxidase including the total proenzyme and the naturally activated one) to challenge the POLS hypothesis in T. molitor. Overall, we found a relationship between behavioural syndrome and reproductive success in this species, thus supporting the POLS hypothesis. We also showed a sex-specific relationship between behavioural syndrome and basal immune parameters. 4.

Theoretical food webs have suggested that species-rich and highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence. Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research. Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new insights into community stability and biodiversity.","10.1111/oik.03642","0030-1299","1600-0706","ISI:000404628700001",NA,NA,NA,NA,135,652,161,"#000000",NA,""

However, examining the variation in behaviour among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk), (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness and IN in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant differences in IIV among different individuals within the population. Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IW in their boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results definitively demonstrate that IN itself varies across individuals and is linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for behavioural interactions.","10.1016/j.beproc.2017.04.014","0376-6357","1872-8308","ISI:000403623300021",NA,"Chevallier, Clement/0000-0002-0956-5978",NA,NA,136,626,490,"#000000",NA,""

We allowed Temnothorax rugatulus rock ants, who create nests by building walls within narrow rock gaps, to repeatedly build nest walls in a fixed crevice but under two environmental conditions. We find that colonies consistently differ in their architecture across environments and over nest building events. Colony identity explained 12-40\% of the variation in nest architecture, while colony properties and environmental conditions explained 5-20\%, as indicated by the condition and marginal R-2 values. When their nest boxes were covered, which produced higher humidity and lower airflow, colonies built thicker, longer, and heavier walls. Colonies also built more robust walls when they had more brood, suggesting a protective function of wall thickness. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to explicitly investigate the repeatability of nestbuilding behavior in a controlled environment.

It has been measured using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation. Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature). During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions) after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures, supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We also estimated the heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age, was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at 0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only, individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival.

We assessed several candidates for personality variables measured in various tests with different contexts over several life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and the agonistic behavioural profile was found.

In our population of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), parental care and nest defense aggression toward a heterospecific are repeatable. We tested the hypothesis that repeatability of testosterone levels within individuals underlies repeatable behaviors observed in our population. We measured nestling provisioning and aggressive nest defense against a heterospecific. After behavioral observations we captured either the male or female bluebird, and determined initial testosterone levels and maximum capacity of the gonads to secrete testosterone by injecting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We found among-individual variation in initial testosterone levels for males and females. Individual males were repeatable in both initial and GnRH-induced testosterone levels across behavioral contexts, while individual females were repeatable in GnRH-induced testosterone levels. However, testosterone levels were not significantly related to parental or nest defense behaviors, suggesting that repeatable testosterone levels may not drive repeatable parental and heterospecific nest defense behaviors in this population. The absence of a relationship between testosterone and parental and heterospecific nest defense behaviors might be due to among-individual variation in testosterone levels. Considering the sources of variation in testosterone levels may reveal why some populations exhibit high individual variation in hormone levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Testosterone, through its pleiotropic effects, plays a crucial role in coordinating morphology, physiology and behavior in a reproductive context. The concentration of circulating testosterone, however, varies over the course of the day and in response to other internal or external stimuli, potentially making it difficult to relate testosterone sampled at one time point with traits of interest. Many researchers now utilize the administration of exogenous GnRH to elicit a standardized stimulation of testosterone secretion. However, it has remained unclear if and how this exogenously stimulated activation of the HPG axis is related with endogenously regulated testosterone that is capable of influencing testosterone related traits. Repeated measures of a hormone can uncover consistent individual variation in hormonal differences at the HPG axis level, variation that potentially stems from underlying genetic variation in a population experiencing identical environmental cues. Thus, we asked, using the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), how daily endogenous variation in testosterone profiles relates to GnRH-induced testosterone secretion. Further, we explore the relationship between endogenous daily testosterone peaks and GnRH-induced testosterone with badge size, a morphological trait related with status within a social group. We found that GnRH-induced testosterone levels reflect a highly repeatable hormonal phenotype that is strongly correlated with nighttime testosterone levels. The results demonstrate the usefulness of GnRH-induced testosterone in studies aimed at understanding individual variation and selection on endogenously regulated testosterone levels and the potential importance of nighttime testosterone levels to physiology and behavior.

This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in which only part of a population migrates while the other remains resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species. Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S. selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus. The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between migratory and resident flies.

We found that male and/or the larger skinks within social pairs were dominant. Developing within this social environment reduced skink growth, and subordinate skinks were more prone to tail loss. Thus, living with a conspecific was costly for E. striolata. The predicted negative effects of isolation failed to materialize. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in behavioural traits depending on the social environment ( isolated, dominant or subordinate member of a pair). Isolated skinks were more social than subordinate skinks. Subordinate skinks also became more aggressive over time, whereas isolated and dominant skinks showed invariable aggression. Dominant skinks became bolder over time, whereas isolated and subordinate skinks were relatively stable in their boldness. In summary, our study is evidence that isolation rearing does not consistently affect behaviour across all social taxa. Our study also demonstrates that the social environment plays an important role in behavioural development of a family-living lizard.","10.1098/rsos.161082","2054-5703",NA,"ISI:000402541800018","UNSP 161082","Noble, Daniel/0000-0001-9460-8743 Whiting, Martin/0000-0002-4662-0227 Riley, Julia/0000-0001-7691-6910","Noble, Daniel/H-6214-2013 Whiting, Martin/E-2999-2010 ",NA,150,193,55,"#000000",NA,""

So, if behavioral ecology already takes an evolutionary approach to variation in behavior, we ask what is personality research about exactly? This question is particularly pertinent now the focus of personality research shifts and the field moves away from being mainly descriptive to include quantitative frameworks.

To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon, enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4 behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance).

Individuals often differ in behavior in a consistent way, including in aggression, thereby showing differences in personality. However, the relative importance of recent experience and aspects of personality in determining rank, as well as the extent to which winning or losing affects aggression, has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate these questions using male domestic fowl. We matched males for body size, comb size, and aggression in pair-wise duels to: 1) study the effect of contest outcome on aggression and 2) compare the effect of individual aggression and contest experience on future social status in small groups. We found that aggression was a highly repeatable personality trait and that aggression increased after winning and decreased after losing. Nevertheless, such winner-loser effects were not enough to increase the odds of becoming dominant in a small group. Instead, aggressiveness measured prior to a contest experience best predicted future rank. Boldness and exploration did not predict rank and of the 2, only boldness was positively correlated with aggressiveness. We conclude that for male domestic fowl in contests among phenotypically matched contestants, aggressiveness is more important for obtaining high rank than winner-loser effects, or other aspects of personality.","10.1093/beheco/arx053","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000401942800037",NA,"Leimar, Olof/0000-0001-8621-6977","Leimar, Olof/L-3781-2014",NA,154,290,435,"#000000",NA,""

The aim of this study was to analyze exploratory behavior and boldness of wild black rats and its changes over time to determine whether exploratory behavior is a personality trait in black rats. Studies on animals with unreduced variability are necessary for determination of normal range of behaviors. The behavior in the open field and hole board tests yielded 1 multivariate variable representing exploratory behavior and 1 representing boldness. The hole board test additionally provided an axis representing exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior showed moderate to high repeatability, even though we observed a considerable effect of habituation. Exploratory behavior was also strongly correlated across contexts; therefore, our results suggest that the black rat responds to heterogenous selection pressure by developing personality types. We also found a strong effect of litter identity on some aspects of the exploratory behavior. Boldness was less repeatable, which we interpret as high behavioral flexibility in this behavioral trait. In concordance with our hypothesis, the personality types in exploratory behavior, but not in boldness, are possibly maintained by heterogenous selection pressure created by human pest management.","10.1037/com0000070","0735-7036","1939-2087","ISI:000401085800007",NA,"Frynta, Daniel/0000-0002-1375-7972 Landova, Eva/0000-0001-8365-8710 Zampachova, Barbora/0000-0002-6285-0495","Frynta, Daniel/L-7350-2016 Landova, Eva/R-8759-2017 Zampachova, Barbora/R-9320-2017",NA,155,132,388,"#000000",NA,""

We studied such within-litter differences in behavior in European rabbit pups Oryctolagus cuniculus prior to weaning, and whether and how these differences co-varied with other individual characteristics such as postnatal body temperature and early growth. The study was conducted under semi natural conditions in a colony of rabbits of wild origin, where the young were born and developed in nursery burrows. We equipped two siblings per litter with interscapular skin temperature loggers on postnatal day 2 and recorded temperature profiles for 48 h. Individual body (skin) temperatures of pups within litters were repeatable across time, indicating the existence of consistent individual differences. Such differences within litters were associated with relative differences in pre-weaning growth, revealing that relatively warmer pups showed a greater increase in body mass during the nest period. Between postnatal days 12 and 17, after the pups had reached a developmental stage of greater mobility, we carried out different behavioral tests: a handling-restraint test, an open field test and a jump-down test from a platform. Individual responses in the former two tests were associated, as those pups showing a quicker straggling response to restraint during handling also exhibited greater exploratory activity in the open field. This correlation across contexts suggests the existence of personality types in wild rabbits at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, pups' behavioral responses were strongly associated with their relative Within-litter body mass at testing. Animals with a lower body mass compared to their siblings showed a relatively quicker struggle response to handling restraint and covered a relatively larger distance in the open field, suggesting greater reactivity and responsiveness of relatively lighter pups in these tests. In contrast, relatively heavier pups jumped sooner from the platform, which may have been due to their greater physical maturation. In conclusion, our study shows that individual differences in behavior and associated differences in body temperature and growth are already present during early postnatal life, although such relationships can be easily overlooked, as they predominantly emerge as relative differences among littermates.

We conducted an experiment in which caged Nm fish were exposed twice to each Vm fish in natural habitats. Results indicated repeatable individual variations in Vm aggression towards Nm. Moreover, diving observations indicated that Nm fish frequently used some of Vm territories inside their own territories, but rarely or never used others. This uneven use of Vm territories by the Nm fish was negatively correlated with individual variations in Vm aggression. We conclude that the preferential access of Nm to Vm territory is gained by Nm's recognising more tolerant Vm fish or discriminating among sites for their territories.","10.1007/s10750-016-2822-7","0018-8158","1573-5117","ISI:000396043800008",NA,"Hata, Hiroki/0000-0001-9438-0646",NA,NA,158,6,232,"#000000",NA,""

It is therefore important to accurately partition phenotypic variances into their within- and between-individual components. Partitioning covariances into both components can also inform about underlying mechanistic pathways that potentially interlink trait expression. In the current study, we applied such a (co) variance partitioning approach to test key predictions of two central hypotheses in behavioral ecology, namely the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis and the challenge hypothesis. To this end, we assessed potential pleiotropic effects of testosterone on male sexual signaling, immune function, and parental care. We here repeatedly measured a set of relevant traits in 47 breeding pairs of captive canaries (Serinus canaria). We found that a within-individual increase in female testosterone level suppressed immune function. Furthermore, testosterone levels were positively related to male song repertoire size as an important component of sexual signaling at the between-male level. These were, however, the only relevant significant correlations. Overall, our data do therefore not convincingly support the hypotheses tested and suggest rather limited hormonal pleiotropic effects of testosterone on immune function, parental care, and male sexual signaling, at least in our study system. Significance statement Phenotypic variances and covariances can nowadays be partitioned easily into within- and between-individual components. These components inform about trait repeatability and the extent to which multiple traits form phenotypic suites of traits, as well as about their joint underlying mechanistic pathways. Testosterone for example, may be key to mediate the expression of suites of traits in many vertebrate species. We here used captive canaries and repeatedly measured male and female traits, relevant in the context of endocrinology, sexual signaling, immune function, and parental investment. For both sexes, we report particularly weak correlations between testosterone and all other measured traits at both within-and between-individual levels. Our case study thus questions the pleiotropic effects of testosterone, but exemplifies the applicability and relevance of (co)variance partitioning in behavioral ecological research.","10.1007/s00265-017-2308-2","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000404164800007","UNSP 74",NA,NA,NA,159,656,62,"#000000",NA,""

Consistent differences between individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals' states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different conspecifics with which individuals associated (their `choosiness' of social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more selective about group members when there was more food, and when they were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences exist among females in this population, and females' measures of sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals' states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females' patterns of sociability over shorter periods.

Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome.

Specifically, we report the effect of boldness on (1) juvenile survivorship in an outdoor pond containing natural prey and predators and (2) adult reproductive success in three outdoor ponds across three reproductive seasons (years). Juvenile survival was negatively affected by boldness, with bolder juveniles having a lower probability of survival than shyer juveniles. In contrast, bolder adult male bass had greater reproductive success than their shyer male counterparts. Female reproductive success was not affected by boldness. These findings demonstrate that boldness can affect fitness differently across life stages. Further, boldness was highly consistent across years and significantly heritable, which suggests that boldness has a genetic component. Thus, our results support theory suggesting that fitness trade-offs across life stages may contribute to the maintenance of personality variation within populations.","10.1086/690909","0003-0147","1537-5323","ISI:000398685600007",NA,NA,"Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013",NA,162,240,99,"#000000",NA,""

Further, behavioural traits (personality traits) form behavioural syndromes, characterised by correlations between different behaviours. Mechanisms maintaining these correlations could be constrained due to underlying relationships with cognitive traits. There is growing evidence for the non-independence of animal personality and general cognitive abilities in animals, but so far, studies on the direction of the relationship between them revealed contradictory results. Still, it is hypothesised that individuals may exhibit consistent learning and decision styles. Fast behavioural types (consistently bolder and more active individuals) are expected to show faster learning styles. Slow behavioural types in contrast are assumed to learn slower but more accurately. This can be caused by a speed-accuracy trade-off that individuals face during decision making. We measured the repeatability of three personality and four spatial cognitive traits in adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We analysed correlations among personality traits (behavioural syndrome). We further investigated the relationships between personality and spatial cognitive traits as a first step exploring the potential connection between personality and cognition in this species. Results: Our results showed that exploration, activity and boldness were repeatable in adult mice. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was also significantly repeatable, as well as spatial learning performance and decision speed. We found no repeatability of decision accuracy. Harvest mice showed a behavioural syndrome as we observed strong positive correlations between personality traits. The speed-accuracy trade-off was not apparent within, nor between individuals.

Increased encounters should in turn drive vulnerability to capture by passively operated gears. However, empirical evidence documenting a relationship between activity-based behaviours and vulnerability to capture by passive fishing gear in the wild is limited. Using whole-lake acoustic telemetry, we first documented significant repeatabilities over several months in a suite of encounter rate-associated behaviours (swimming distance, activity space size, time on baited feeding sites, switching frequency among baited feeding sites, distance to the lake bottom) in two recreationally important benthivorous cyprinid species, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tench (Tinca tinca). We then experimentally targeted both species using stationary angling on baited feeding sites. Individual fish regularly visited the angling sites, documenting that the fishes encountered the angling baits. When attempting to explain individual variation in vulnerability as a function of repeatable behavioural traits, we found no evidence of a significant relationship among various encounter-based behaviours and vulnerability to angling for both species. There was also no evidence for size selection or for energetically less conditioned fish to be more vulnerable. The data cumulatively suggest that fine-scale behaviours after encountering a bait (e.g., frequency of bait intake) may be ultimately decisive for determining vulnerability to angling in benthivorous fish. Based on our work, fishing-induced selection on encounter-based behaviours in recreational angling for benthivorous fish in the wild appears unlikely.","10.1371/journal.pone.0173989","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000396318300106","e0173989","Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X",NA,NA,165,206,403,"#000000",NA,""

Heart rate (HR) (beats per minute (BPM)) is associated with feed efficiency and influenced by autonomic activity and peripheral metabolism, suggesting HR could be used as a proxy for feed efficiency. Objectives were to assess associations between overnight HR, lying patterns and RFI, and between acute stress HR and RFI. Heifer calves (n=107; 408 +/- 28 days of age, 341 +/- 42.2 kg) and yearling heifers (n=36; 604 +/- 92 days of age, 539 +/- 52.2 kg) were exposed to a performance test to determine productive performance. Overnight HR (electrode based) and lying patterns (accelerometer based) were monitored on a subgroup of heifer calves (n=40; 20 lowest RFI; 20 highest RFI). In the 10-min acute stress assessment, all heifers were individually exposed to the opening and closing of an umbrella and HR before (HRBEF), in response to (HRMAX), after (HRAFT) and change (HRCHG; HRAFT-HRBEF) as a result of exposure were determined. Using polynomial regression, rate of HR decrease pre-exposure (beta(1)) and rates of HR increase (beta(2)) and decrease (beta 3, beta(4)) post-exposure were determined. Heifer calves in the overnight assessment were classified into equal RFI groups (low RFI; high RFI) and HR means were treated as repeated measures and compared using multiple regression. In the acute stress assessment, heifers were classified within cattle category into equal RFI groups (low RFI; high RFI) and means and polynomial regression parameters were compared using multiple regression. Low-RFI heifer calves had a lower overnight HR (69.2 v. 72.6 BPM), similar HR change from lying to standing intervals (8.9 v. 9.2 BPM) and similar time lying (61.1\% v. 64.5\%) compared with high-RFI heifer calves. Low-RFI heifer calves had a higher absolute HRMAX (162.9 v. 145.7 BPM) and beta(2) (-0.34 v. -0.20) than high-RFI heifer calves. Low-RFI yearling heifers had similar acute stress HR means and a lower beta(1) (0.003 v. 0.006) than high-RFI yearling heifers. Overnight HR and acute stress HR are potential indicators of RFI in heifer calves. However, acute stress HR results varied in yearling heifers, suggesting previous handling experience and/or age influence stress response. Pending further development (predictive ability, repeatability), the acute stress assessment could have potential for on-farm application as a feed efficiency proxy in young heifers with minimal handling experience.","10.1017/S1751731116001695","1751-7311","1751-732X","ISI:000398132900011",NA,NA,NA,NA,167,54,164,"#000000",NA,""

In this field study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain between-individual variation in risktaking behaviour in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within-and between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day. We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall, time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour, but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect immediate risk-taking decisions.","10.1007/s00265-017-2276-6","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000396123300009","UNSP 54","CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,168,214,289,"#000000",NA,""

Labile characters allow individuals to flexibly adjust their phenotype to changes in environmental conditions. There is growing evidence that individuals can differ both in average expression and level of plasticity in this type of character. Both of these aspects are studied in conjunction within a reaction norm framework. 2. Theoreticians have investigated the factors promoting variation in reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes (level of plasticity) of a key labile character: behaviour. A general prediction from their work is that selection will favour the evolution of repeatable individual variation in level of plasticity only under certain ecological conditions. While factors promoting individual repeatability of plasticity have thus been identified, empirical estimates of this phenomenon are largely lacking for wild populations. 3. We assayed aggressiveness of individual male great tits (Parus major) twice during their egg-laying stage and twice during their egg-incubation stage to quantify each male's level of seasonal plasticity. This procedure was applied during six consecutive years; all males breeding in our plots during those years were assayed, resulting in repeated measures of individual reaction norms for any individual breeding in multiple years. We quantified among-and within-individual variation in reaction norm components, allowing us to estimate repeatability of seasonal plasticity. Using social pedigree information, we further partitioned reaction norm components into their additive genetic and permanent environmental counterparts. 4. Cross-year individual repeatability for the intercepts (average aggressiveness) and slopes (level of seasonal plasticity) of the aggressiveness reaction norms were 0.574 and 0.516 respectively. The mean of the posterior distributions suggested modest heritabilities (h(2) = 0.260 for intercepts; h(2) = 0.266 for slopes), but these estimates were relatively uncertain. Males behaved more aggressively in areas with higher breeding densities, and became less aggressive and less plastic with increasing age; plasticity thus varied within individuals and was multidimensional in nature. 5. This empirical study quantified cross-year individual repeatability, heritability and agerelated reversible plasticity in behaviour. Acknowledging such patterns of multi-level variation is important not only for testing behavioural ecology theory concerning the evolution of repeatable differences in behavioural plasticity but also for predicting how reversible plasticity may evolve in natural populations.","10.1111/1365-2656.12621","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000397968700007",NA,NA,NA,NA,170,499,656,"#000000",NA,""

However, it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i) for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability estimates because these two indices carry different information. We discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies, including meta-analyses.","10.1111/1365-2435.12779","0269-8463","1365-2435","ISI:000395347300014",NA,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182","Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011",NA,171,361,221,"#000000",NA,""

The phenotypic composition of the breeding population changed throughout the study period (4-5 harrier generations), with a gradual disappearance of shy individuals, leading to a greater proportion of bolder ones and a more behaviourally homogeneous population.

While fitness relates to the performance of animals in the wild, most of the research on evolutionary potential of behavioural traits has used captive or mesocosm settings, especially with aquatic organisms. We investigated the individual level consistency (personalities) and correlations (behavioural syndromes) of fitness-related behavioural traits displayed by a harvested marine fish in the natural environment, and the potential of such individual level behaviour to constrain adaptive evolution. For this, we acoustically tracked 303 individuals of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, over a period of 3 years from two populations in southern Norway. We then estimated repeatability and correlations between four behavioural traits: diel vertical migration, activity, home range and dispersal. Average autonomy was estimated as a measure of the potential of the observed behavioural syndromes to constrain evolution. We found a moderate to high individual consistency in all behavioural traits (mean repeatability 0.41, range 0.22-0.66) suggesting that they reflect fish personalities. Also, behavioural traits were structured into behavioural syndromes, where one population displayed a more integrated behavioural syndrome (all the four traits correlated) than the other (only home range and dispersal correlated). In both populations, the magnitude of these behavioural syndromes could potentially constrain evolution, as revealed by average autonomy values significantly below 1. Our study provides strong empirical support to the idea that natural and human-induced selection on behavioural traits can indeed drive adaptive evolution, and, further, that such evolutionary responses may be constrained by the correlational structure among multiple traits.

In songbirds, a number of singing behaviors have been proposed to be aggressive signals used in territory defense, including song rate. Although aggressive signaling in songbirds has received considerable research attention, adequate evidence for most putative aggressive signals is not available. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether the song rate of male wood warblers Phylloscopus sibilatrix is a signal of their aggressive intent in male-male interactions. We found that males responded differentially to simulated territorial intrusions depending on the song rate of an intruder. Moreover, males that continued to sing during territorial contests increased their song rates, and this behavior predicted the strength of aggressive escalation by the signaler. These results suggest that song rate is an aggressive signal during male-male interactions in the wood warbler. We also found high intra-individual repeatability in the strength of aggressive response to simulated intrusions, likely reflecting differences in personality (aggressiveness) or quality of male wood warblers. We conclude that changes in singing rate may be an efficient mechanism of signaling immediate shifts in motivation of signalers during territorial contests, especially in species that lack large repertoires or have simple songs.","10.1111/jav.00969","0908-8857","1600-048X","ISI:000395430600010",NA,"Kuczynski, Lechoslaw/0000-0003-3498-5445 Szymkowiak, Jakub/0000-0002-4595-1876","Kuczynski, Lechoslaw/E-5525-2011 ",NA,174,546,416,"#000000",NA,""

Phenotypic variation exists in and at all levels of biological organization: variation exists among species, among-individuals within-populations, and in the case of l within-populations abile traits, within-individuals. Mixed-effects models represent ideal tools to quantify multilevel measurements of traits and are being increasingly used in evolutionary ecology. Mixed-effects models are relatively complex, and two main issues may be hampering their proper usage: (i) the relatively few educational resources available to teach new users how to implement and interpret them and (ii) the lack of tools to ensure that the statistical parameters of interest are correctly estimated. In this paper, we introduce Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences (SQuID), a simulation-based tool that can be used for research and educational purposes. SQuID creates a virtual world inhabited by subjects whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined phenotypic equation, which allows easy translation of biological hypotheses into quantifiable parameters. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences currently models normally distributed traits with linear predictors, but SQuID is subject to further development and will adapt to handle more complex scenarios in the future. The current framework is suitable for performing simulation studies, determining optimal sampling designs for user-specific biological problems and making simulation-based inferences to aid in the interpretation of empirical studies. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences is also a teaching tool for biologists interested in learning, or teaching others, how to implement and interpret linear mixed-effects models when studying the processes causing phenotypic variation. Interface-based modules allow users to learn about these issues. As research on effects of sampling designs continues, new issues will be implemented in new modules, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian data.","10.1111/2041-210X.12659","2041-210X","2041-2096","ISI:000395092500013",NA,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261 Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011 Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,175,556,419,"#000000",NA,""

Here we examined the effect of exposure to seawater-borne copper on the startle response behaviour of European hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus across these levels. Copper exposure rapidly led to longer startle responses on average, but did not lead to any change in repeatability indicating that individual differences were present and equally consistent in the presence and absence of copper.

While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the expression of these variance components were sex-specific. Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein. We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood. Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males, and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in female body weight. Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'), though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such as behaviour and body weight.","10.1186/s12862-016-0852-4","1471-2148",NA,"ISI:000392452900001","8",NA,NA,NA,179,659,449,"#000000",NA,""

As charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at distances of <= 3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified two distinct turtle personality types, `bold' and `timid', based upon 145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further, turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of turtles.","10.1007/s00442-016-3804-1","0029-8549","1432-1939","ISI:000411577400027",NA,"Gagne, Tyler/0000-0002-8584-6368 Wilson, Alexander/0000-0002-7696-1671",NA,NA,180,314,572,"#000000",NA,""

We found that dominants that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover, changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative tendencies.

We provided 98 juvenile crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development, throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3 weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the 2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats.

While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to reveal linkages or trade - offs. In animals, these validations have widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The animals did not learn to ``always choose the larger item{''} in the cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual differences.

This would be problematic if particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate, skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions, with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific, predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions, yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition. Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or females. While participation among males in high body condition was consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females, regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later, rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex, body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual differences in cognition difficult to interpret.

Exploration may influence learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality. Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90 degrees (vertical, the S+) and 135 degrees (the S-). After training pigeons underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the direction towards the S-. These results suggest that birds with different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned information.

We repeatedly observed 13 territorial male pupfish and measured individual aggression, focusing on defensive chases against gambusia and interactions with other pupfish. Short-distance chases at gambusia and chases of territorial neighbors were significantly repeatable, indicating that pupfish show behavioral consistency, or personality.

I examined whether wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, were consistent in their responses to diverse novel objects, and tested whether experimentally assayed boldness predicted the number of times individuals were observed inspecting naturally occurring snakes at close range. Boldness was repeatable across three novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections predicted approach of this item. Age-sex class differences in boldness and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder than adult females and had higher snake inspection counts. These age-sex differences fit well with expected variation in risk-reward ratios of exploratory risk-taking behaviour considered within a life history framework for this species.

We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity.

Using a design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components. Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals are observed.

Key in this regard is the, often untested, assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for significant between-individual correlations between the investigated traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have important implications for the social organization within complex social environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant processes.

In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles. Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic female resistance.","10.1111/eth.12575","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000390697900007",NA,NA,NA,NA,197,70,483,"#000000",NA,""

Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter-and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability).","10.1242/jeb.146712","0022-0949","1477-9145","ISI:000391279300006",NA,"Careau, Vincent/0000-0002-2826-7837 Roche, Dominique/0000-0002-3326-864X","Careau, Vincent/A-9778-2008 ",NA,199,157,265,"#000000",NA,""

In addition, we consider recent advances in studies of relationships between personality traits and particular types of behavioral plasticity, including statistical methods which facilitate analyses of relationships between personality traits, contextual plasticity, temporal plasticity and intraindividual variability, and empirical tests of predicted relationships between personality traits and other types of behavioral plasticity (flexibility, learning rates). As the field of animal personality and behavioral plasticity moves from a largely descriptive to a predictive phase, we suggest that there is ample room for empirical tests of recent models that predict individual differences in behavioral developmental trajectories, and for the development of new formal models that make strong predictions about relationships between personality traits and specific types of behavioral plasticity.","10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.08.008","2352-1546","2352-1554","ISI:000395324100005",NA,NA,NA,NA,200,406,101,"#000000",NA,""

Personality traits, consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies so far have investigated the link between personality traits and dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups, dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance hierarchies found in nature.

Populations of Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits. Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex, while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that fish caught from environments without predators and with probable intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes, relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of studying temperament within a community ecology context.

Wormlion larvae are sit-and-wait dipteran predators that inhabit shaded microhabitats in the field and also prefer shade in the laboratory. The aim of the present study was to examine wormlion larvae behavioural repeatability in general and specifically in the context of habitat preference. In order to achieve this, three experiments were conducted to determine whether, to what extent and under which conditions wormlion preference for shaded microhabitats is repeatable. 3. Individual tendency to relocate when the environment conditions deteriorate was also assessed, by switching between shaded and illuminated conditions, either with or without pit destruction. 4. Larvae showed a highly repeatable preference for shade. Repeatability was detected in additional behavioural traits: pit construction, pit area and tendency to relocate. 5. This behavioural repeatability was demonstrated under constant microhabitat conditions, with distinct behaviours in each setting. Under constant illumination, wormlions constructed smaller pits, moved over longer distances and were found at the tray edges more frequently than under constant shade conditions, suggesting that illuminated environments are perceived as risky or unsuitable. 6. Switching between the two microhabitat conditions without pit destruction induced fewer relocations than switching with pit destruction, suggesting that wormlions do not tend to abandon their pits, even if their microhabitat conditions deteriorate.","10.1111/een.12347","0307-6946","1365-2311","ISI:000388585300009",NA,NA,NA,NA,204,259,628,"#000000",NA,""

These differences are often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for the development of personality in animals. Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is, individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this study, we observed that personality differences were not present at juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that the decline in behavioral plasticity with age may represent a relevant mechanism for behavioral differentiation in animals, in agreement with evidences from the human literature on age-related loss in behavioral plasticity.","10.1007/s00265-016-2206-z","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000387656900005",NA,"Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X","Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008",NA,205,205,561,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \% more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral strategy.","10.1007/s00265-016-2215-y","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000387656900012",NA,NA,NA,NA,206,555,369,"#000000",NA,""

Each mare was first exposed to two stallions (haphazardly selected out of seven) and her behavior recorded. The mare was then returned to her box (i.e., no contact to stallions during that time). Approximately 4.5 hours later, venous blood samples were collected every minute during 30 minutes preceding exposure to one of the two previously used stallions, 6 minutes during exposure, and 30 minutes after exposure back in the mare's box. The procedure was repeated in the consecutive estrus cycle, with the difference that the mare was each exposed to the other of the two stallions during oxytocin measurements. In 20 of the 26 trials, oxytocin concentrations were significantly elevated during exposure to the stallion, without significant associations to cortisol and estradiol concentrations. We found no significant association between oxytocin secretion and preferences in the previous choice situation. While estradiol concentration showed a high repeatability over the two cycles, we found considerable intraindividual differences in oxytocin and cortisol plasma concentration among the two cycles. Partially, the variation in oxytocin concentrations could be linked to the time of ovulation, with lower oxytocin plasma concentrations in mares which ovulated later than expected. In conclusion, when teasing under experimental conditions, we found high interindividual and intraindividual variation among mares in the increase of oxytocin plasma concentrations, depending on the timing of ovulation. However, oxytocin levels seemed to be no predictor of mare preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using an automated acoustic telemetry system, we tracked individual positions of adult perch in a whole natural lake for about 1 year and compared several model frameworks for the individual responses to water temperature. The best-fit model revealed that rising water temperature led to an increase in both between-and within-individual variation in activity, thereby stabilizing behavioral repeatability across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent individual differences in behavior could be partially explained by factors such as slowly changing states in the wild.

We assayed aggressiveness toward a prey cue, and boldness while individuals resided on their own web versus after being translocated onto webs built by conspecifics. We quantified the importance of individual differences in aggressiveness and boldness while accounting for differences in web characteristics. We tested for relationships between web building, aggressiveness, and boldness. Web characteristics affected spider aggressiveness and interacted with individual web-building behavior to explain up to a fifth of the variation in foraging aggression, but did not affect spider boldness. Even after accounting for web characteristics, individuals still exhibited important differences in aggressiveness. We detected no relationship between an individual's aggressiveness behavioral type and the characteristics of the web it built. Surprisingly, web characteristics impacted aggressiveness differently from one individual to the next. Hence the effect of web characteristics on foraging behavior might depend on condition or past experience. Webs contributed mostly to the variation in aggressiveness within-individuals.

When these behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted within the ``coping style{''} framework. As studying inter-individual variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second, explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was considerable covariation among the stress response parameters, describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level. Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food acquisition tactics and demographic performance.

It has earlier been shown that spot density is a heritable trait, and may be used as an indicator of stress coping style in Arctic charr. Individuals with few spots tend to be more aggressive and less responsive to stress (proactive) than those with many spots (reactive). Here, we evaluate the potential of grading individuals into proactive and reactive individuals by the density of light-coloured spots. This non-invasive method would be useful for selective breeding and to reduce within-treatment variation in biological research. Our aim was to investigate stability of spot density over time and to compare methods to estimate spottiness on Arctic charr, using photographs as well as live fish. The consistency of spot density was significant over a period of 8months, but with stronger correlations between September and December than between May and September. Also, repeatability of spot number was higher between the two last months than when including May. The spots were more stable on the left than the right side, thus, it is more reliable to estimate spottiness on the left side. There was a significant relationship between the ratio of spotted area (rsa) from automated image analysis and number of spots from visual counts. Both methods fitted well into a visual grading into three categories (few, medium and many spots). In another test, a large number of live fish were visually categorized according to spot density. The previous validation process, in combination with a significant family effect showed that large numbers of fish can be effectively graded.","10.1111/jzo.12374","0952-8369","1469-7998","ISI:000387130000007",NA,"Backstrom, Tobias/0000-0003-1984-9533",NA,NA,212,173,349,"#000000",NA,""

Environmental variation can lead to divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish, Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours, the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world could serve as a valuable conservation tool.

The costs and benefits of neophobia may vary throughout the year if predation pressure, resource distribution or conspecific competition changes seasonally. Despite such variation, neophobia levels are often assumed to be temporally and individually stable. Whether or not neophobia expression changes seasonally and fluctuates equally for all individuals is crucial to understanding the drivers, consequences and plasticity of novelty avoidance. We investigated seasonal differences and individual consistency in the motivation and novelty responses of a captive group of rooks, Corvus frugilegus, a seasonally breeding, colonial species of corvid that is known for being neophobic. We tested the group around novel objects and novel people to determine whether responses generalized across novelty types, and considered whether differences in dominance could influence the social risk of approaching unknown stimuli. We found that the group's level of object neophobia was stable year-round, but individuals were not consistent between seasons, despite being consistent within seasons. In contrast, the group's avoidance of novel people decreased during the breeding season, and individuals were consistent year-round. Additionally, although subordinate birds were more likely to challenge dominants during the breeding season, this social risk taking did not translate to greater novelty approach. Since seasonal variation and individual consistency varied differently towards each novelty type, responses towards novel objects and people seem to be governed by different mechanisms. Such a degree of fluctuation has consequences for other individually consistent behaviours often measured within the nonhuman personality literature. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Behaviourally mediated responses to landscape modification may generate behavioural divergence among populations along environmental gradients. We tested whether movement behaviour of red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, is repeatable and whether it varies within and between forest stands of different ages in a fragmented landscape in New York, U.S.A. Water loss is a major constraint on P. cinereus mobility, and forest fragmentation creates spatial variation in desiccation risk. We quantified multiple components of individual movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment in the laboratory and used ordination to identify behavioural variation among individuals in multivariate space. We tested for repeatability of individual behaviour and then examined behavioural differences between individuals captured from populations at two spatial scales where desiccation risk was expected to vary: (1) between edge and interior locations within forest stands and (2) between forest stands varying in time since agricultural abandonment. Variation in movement behaviour among individuals was characterized by three components: total movement activity (e.g. surface activity, distance moved, boundary crossings), substrate use (time on moist soil versus dry sand) and latency to initial movement. Each behavioural component was significantly repeatable. At the population level, individuals from old forest stands (>= 77 years) showed greater movement activity than individuals from young stands. Movement behaviour did not differ between individuals from edge and interior locations within forest stands. Our results demonstrate that P. cinereus individuals show consistent differences in movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment. Moreover, we show that movement behaviour can be spatially structured within fragmented landscapes, but that behavioural divergence among populations depends on spatial scale.

Regarding the coping style of individuals, recent studies on personality-dependent space use within a habitat indicate that `proactive' individuals are wider ranging than `reactive' ones. However, such studies are still scarce and cover limited taxonomic diversity, and thus, more research is needed to explore whether this pattern generalises across species. We examined the link between coping style and space use in a population of crows (Corvus corone) freely inhabiting the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria. We used a binary docility rating (struggle during handling vs. no struggle) and a tonic immobility test to quantify individual coping style. Individual space use was quantified as the number of different sites at which each crow was observed, and we controlled for different number of sightings per individual by creating a space use index. Only the binary docility rating showed repeatability over time, and significantly predicted space use. In contrast to previous studies, we found that reactive crows (no struggle during handling) showed wider ranging space use within the study site than proactive individuals (who struggled during handling). The discrepancy from previous results suggests that the relationship between behavioural type and space use may vary between species, potentially reflecting differences in socioecology.","10.1111/eth.12536","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000385572700004",NA,"Ringler, Max/0000-0002-4530-4919 Miller, Rachael/0000-0003-2996-9571 Deventer, Sarah/0000-0001-6188-5023","Ringler, Max/J-4821-2012 ",NA,217,73,144,"#000000",NA,""

However, the general relationship between individuals' body state and various personality metrics/average behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals' body condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals' average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A. studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A. studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial effects on individuals' average personality type and the correlations between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust positive relationship between food availability and the signature of consistent individual differences in behavior. Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and boldness but not correlations between these traits.

In many animals, male and female behaviour often diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring the very strong possibility that key components of personality, behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that explains the delicate skink's successful invasion history via accidental introductions. We found that females were more social than males and showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were consistently more active explored environments faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade. Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual's personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome.

Furthermore, elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves, and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this, we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e., variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences. Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that individuals face throughout their lives. Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel environment).

Hence, alterations to endocrine factors may dramatically affect individual behavior that has subsequent fitness consequences. Yet it is unclear how hormonal or behavioral traits change with environmental stressors or over multiple reproductive opportunities, particularly for biparental fauna. To simulate an environmental stressor, we exposed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs to novel coyote odor attractants (i.e. commercial scent lures) mid gestation to influence territorial behaviors, fecal glucocorticoid (FGMs) and fecal androgen metabolites (FAMs). In addition, we observed coyote pairs as first-time and experienced breeders to assess the influence of parity on our measures. Treatment pairs received the odors four times over a 20-day period, while control pairs received water. Odor-treated pairs scent-marked (e.g. urinated, ground scratched) and investigated odors more frequently than control pairs, and had higher FAMs when odors were provided. Pairs had higher FAMs as first-time versus experienced breeders, indicating that parity also affected androgen production during gestation. Moreover, repeatability in scent-marking behaviors corresponded with FGMs and FAMs, implying that coyote territoriality during gestation is underpinned by individually-specific hormone profiles. Our results suggest coyote androgens during gestation are sensitive to conspecific olfactory stimuli and prior breeding experience. Consequently, fluctuations in social or other environmental stimuli as well as increasing parity may acutely affect coyote traits essential to reproductive success.

This variation will probably have broad biological and methodological implications to the study of trait variation in labile traits, such as behaviour and physiology, though we currently need studies to quantify variation in rIIV, using more standardized and powerful methodology. Focusing on activity rates in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we provide a model example, from sampling design to data analysis, in how to quantify rIIV in labile traits. Building on the doubly hierarchical generalized linear model recently used to quantify individual differences in rIIV, we extend the model to evaluate the covariance between individual mean values and their rIIV.

In response to nest predation, many bird species produce specific sounds, such as the hissing calls in incubating great tits (Parus major), that may provoke an acoustic startle response in the predator. However, it is still unclear whether the propensity of incubating females to produce hissing calls towards nest predators depends on the reproductive investment. With our 3-year study, we show that response type (females that do not hiss versus females giving hissing calls) to a potential nest predator, the woodpecker, is a repeatable trait. We found no differences in the studied reproductive traits between hissing and non-hissing birds. Interestingly, among hissing birds, fast-responding females started egg-laying earlier than slow-responding ones. Among non-hissing birds, heavier birds initiated clutches earlier. We also revealed that hissing birds breed in areas with decreased nest-box occupancy, suggesting either that they potentially select different areas to breed or that territory size is larger as a result of hissing birds being more aggressive. These findings demonstrate that response type is not related to the early reproductive value of the brood across distinct behavioural groups. However, our results do suggest that non-hissing and hissing females differ in terms of individual quality or dominance or personality related aspects.","10.1007/s10211-016-0239-y","0873-9749","1437-9546","ISI:000385628400003",NA,NA,NA,NA,223,337,383,"#000000",NA,""

A field experiment","PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR","2016","164","A","400-406","OCT 1","Several studies have shown that individuals with higher metabolic rates (MRs) feed at higher rates and are more willing to forage in the presence of predators. This increases the acquisition of resources, which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking. We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR) over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The effect size observed in the present study was small (similar to 1\%) and would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an open question.

However, evidence for whether behavior correlates across asocial and social settings is mixed, and no study has linked observed trends with underlying mechanisms. Consistent differences between individuals in boldness, which describes willingness to accept reward over risk, are likely to be under strong selection pressure. By testing three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in a risky foraging task alone and repeatedly in shoals, we demonstrate that the expression of boldness in groups is context-specific. Whereas personality is repeatable in a low-risk behavior (leaving a refuge), the collectively made consensus decision to then cross the arena outweighs leadership by bolder individuals, explaining the suppression of personality in this context. However, despite this social coordination, bolder individuals were still more likely to feed. Habituation and satiation over repeated trials degrade the effect of personality on leaving the refuge and also whether crossing the arena is a collective decision. The suppression of personality in groups suggests that individual risk-taking tendency may rarely represent actual risk in social settings, with implications for the evolution and ecology of personality variation.","10.1126/sciadv.1600892","2375-2548",NA,"ISI:000383734400019","UNSP e1600892","Rands, Sean/0000-0002-7400-005X Ioannou, Christos/0000-0002-9739-889X","Rands, Sean/B-2243-2008 ",NA,230,122,452,"#000000",NA,""

To explore the relationship between individual differences in behavior and architectural constructions, we quantified 1) the level of consistent individual variation in several elements of web structure and 2) the level of consistent individual variation in foraging behavior and its relationship with web structure. We controlled for condition-dependent or environmental effects by satiating all spiders prior to assays and maintaining them in standardized conditions. Spiders exhibited consistent differences in the number of gumfooted lines they built for capturing preys and overall web weight, but not in the number of structural lines.

We tested for a trade-off between speed and accuracy in foraging great tits. We found support for a speed-accuracy trade-off among-individuals but not within-individuals. These findings thereby imply that these patterns were level-specific, and caused by multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously. This study may be used to guide further empirical studies focusing on level-specificity of relationships between behavioral and cognitive traits.Animals often face a conflict between the speed and accuracy by which a decision is made. Decisions taken quickly might be relatively inaccurate, whereas decisions taken more slowly might be more accurate. Such ``speed-accuracy trade-offs{''} receive increasing attention in behavioral and cognitive sciences. Importantly, life-history theory predicts that trade-offs typically exist only at certain hierarchical levels, such as within rather than among individuals. We therefore examined within- and among-individual correlations in the speed and accuracy by which decisions are taken, using a foraging context in wild-caught great tits (Parus major) as a worked example. We find that great tits exhibit among-individual variation in speed-accuracy trade-offs: some individuals predictably made relatively slow but accurate decisions, whereas others were predictably faster but less accurate. We did not, however, find evidence for the trade-off at the within-individual level. These level-specific relationships imply that different mechanisms acted across levels. These findings highlight the need for future work on the integration of individual behavior and cognition across hierarchical levels.","10.1093/beheco/arw077","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000384650600036",NA,"Mathot, Kimberley/0000-0003-2021-1369","Mathot, Kimberley/A-2544-2017",NA,232,14,28,"#405d99","selected","speed-accuracy trade off behaviour"

Under this hypothesis, individuals with consistently high levels of behavioral activity should also have high resting metabolic rate (RMR) as it can reflect capacity to process food and generate energy. We tested for the predicted positive covariance between RMR and three behaviors that differ in energy demands in 30 male guppies, using multivariate mixed models; we repeatedly measured their activity (10 times each), courtship displays (nine times), voracity (10 times), and metabolism (four-times). Resting metabolic rate (measured overnight in respirometry trials) did not consistently differ among males, whereas initial peak metabolism measured during those same trials (R=0.42), and all behaviors were repeatable (R=0.33-0.51). RMR declined over time suggesting habituation to the protocol, whereas peak metabolism did not. Initial peak metabolism was negatively correlated with courtship display intensity, and voracity was positively correlated with activity, but all other among-individual correlations were not significant. We conclude that RMR does not provide a proximate explanation for consistent individual differences in behavior in male guppies, and therefore the potential for independent evolution of these physiological and behavioral traits seems possible. Finally, we identify peak metabolism as a potential measure of the stress response to confinement, which highlights the value of considering various aspects of metabolic rates recording during respirometry trials.","10.1002/ece3.2373","2045-7758",NA,"ISI:000384527200009",NA,NA,NA,NA,233,558,599,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we used free-living African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context. Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts. Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific syndrome in this species.

(ii) What are the contributions of genetic and plastic effects to this behavioural divergence? (iii) And to what extent are responses to predation and parasitism repeatable across independent evolutionary lineages? We addressed these questions using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (i) varying in their exposure to dangerous fish predators and Gyrodactylus ectoparasites for (ii) both wild-caught F0 and laboratory-reared F2 individuals and coming from (iii) multiple independent evolutionary lineages (i.e. independent drainages). Several key findings emerged. First, a population's history of predation and parasitism influenced behavioural profiles, but to different extent depending on the behaviour considered (activity, shoaling or boldness). Second, we had evidence for some genetic effects of predation regime on behaviour, with differences in activity of F2 laboratory-reared individuals, but not for parasitism, which had only plastic effects on the boldness of wild-caught F0 individuals. Third, the two lineages showed a mixture of parallel and nonparallel responses to predation/parasitism, with parallel responses being stronger for predation than for parasitism and for activity and boldness than for shoaling. These findings suggest that different sets of behaviours provide different pay-offs in alternative predation/parasitism environments and that parasitism has more transient effects in shaping intraspecific variation of behaviour than does predation.","10.1111/jeb.12880","1010-061X","1420-9101","ISI:000382500100012",NA,NA,NA,NA,239,382,547,"#000000",NA,""

We employed four behavioural assays to document the existence of two distinct behavioural types (bold' and shy') in this species. We found consistent metabolic differences between individuals of a given behavioural type across an environmental gradient: shy individuals had overall lower aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and standard metabolic rate than bold individuals in both high (25 ppt) and low (3 ppt) salinity. These behavioural and metabolic differences translated into divergent physiological responses during acute stress: shy individuals adopted a passive freeze-hide' response by reducing their oxygen consumption rates (akin to shallow breathing) whereas bold individuals adopted an active fight-flight' response by increasing their rates of respiration. These distinct defence strategies were repeatable within individuals between salinity treatments. Although it has been suggested theoretically, this is the first empirical evidence that the metabolic response to stressful situations differs between bold and shy individuals.

Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation, and whether or not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs, and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system. Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of `novel object exploration', `boldness' and `activity in an unknown area' to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females' strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/ or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared when the size difference between the stimulus males was small. Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating decisions, respectively.","10.1186/s12862-016-0712-2","1471-2148",NA,"ISI:000378675100002","138","Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-0223-1254 ARIAS RODRIGUEZ, LENIN/0000-0002-8025-5569 Jourdan, Jonas/0000-0002-2745-2520","Riesch, Rudiger/A-5787-2008 ",NA,243,186,39,"#000000",NA,""

To address this issue, we investigated whether the disparity in territorial aggression of urban and rural male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, is individually consistent within a breeding period. Additionally, to better understand the physiological and ecological factors underlying this behavioural difference, we examined whether territoriality was associated with plasma testosterone, a hormone that contributes to elevated aggression in vertebrates, and/or conspecific density, a factor often positively related to aggression. The urbanization-related difference in territoriality was individually consistent within a breeding period. However, the elevated territorial aggression of urban birds was not associated with plasma testosterone and, counter to our predictions, conspecific density was lower in urban compared with rural areas. We suggest that other aspects of testosterone signalling and features of the socio-ecological environment, such as the availability of breeding sites, may underlie increased territorial aggression in urban birds.","10.1098/rsbl.2016.0315","1744-9561","1744-957X","ISI:000386717900022","20160315","Sewall, Kendra/0000-0002-9347-5878",NA,NA,244,35,272,"#000000",NA,""

Here we show that acoustic signalling rate is repeatable and strongly related to personality in a highly social mammal, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica). Furthermore, acoustic signalling varied between environments of differing quality, with males from a poor-quality environment having a reduced vocalization rate compared with females and males from an enriched environment. Such differences may be mediated by personality with pigs from a poor-quality environment having more reactive and more extreme personality scores compared with pigs from an enriched environment. Our results add to the evidence that acoustic signalling reflects personality in a non-human mammal.

Although empirical studies have investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different levels (between-partner, or partner `personality', and within-partner levels, or partner `plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test whether partners represent a component of the social environment affecting the expression of labile traits.

This study aimed to measure and quantify trait anxiety using novel behavioural paradigms. Diazepam is an anxiolytic drug which can be used to validate behavioural paradigms that are designed to measure anxiety. Greyhound dogs from a Canine Blood Bank were recruited. Dogs were individually tested in two behavioural paradigms, named the modified open field and the unconditioned substrate preference. The modified open field test consisted of a standard open field test of 10 min duration, followed by six individual 10 kHz 110 dB 1-second tones played every 30s, interspersed with continuous white noise played at increasing intensity from 10 dB up to 90 dB. For one group of dogs, the test was repeated three times, with two weeks between each test. The greyhounds were pre-treated orally with either an empty gel capsule (sham) or 1 mg/kg diazepam 90 min before the third trial (n=39). A second group was treated 90 min before a single naive exposure to the test (n=24). Video recordings of the trials were analysed using software which tracked the position of the dog over time. Total distance travelled demonstrated a high test-retest repeatability within subjects (Spearman's r=0.813, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.90, P<0.001) and was increased on average in both test-naive (167.6 m, 95\% CI: 54.8-280.4, P=0.005) and test-experienced (139.0 m, 95\% CI: 89.1-189.0, P<0.001) dogs that had been pre-treated with diazepam when compared with sham. A noise tone as a distance-increasing signal over time had a reduced effect on mean midline distance following diazepam pre-treatment when compared with sham in the test-naive (-0.79, 95\% CI: -1.6 to 0.0, P=0.047), but not to the same extent in the test-experienced (-0.47, 95\% CI: -1.5 to 0.6, P=0.370) dogs. The unconditioned substrate preference test consisted of a room that had a concrete floor with half the flooring covered with plastic (a floor substrate unfamiliar to the greyhounds). There was little effect of diazepam pre-treatment on preference for the novel plastic floor substrate. This study suggests that the anxiolytic effect of diazepam on dog behaviour may be measured through an increase in exploratory behaviour and a reduction in noise aversion. Furthermore, exploratory behaviour and noise aversion may represent aspects of underlying trait anxiety as these behaviours have reliable test-retest repeatability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, according to the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis, individual variation in metabolic expenditure and stress physiology should be linked with exploration, aggression, or risk-taking behaviors. Previous studies have uncovered stable individual differences in metabolic expenditure and circulating glucorticoids in common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). We tested the correlations between standard metabolic rates (SMR), glucorticoid stress response, and behavioral traits (activity, aggressiveness, risk taking, and sociability) in males. In ectotherms, the thermal dependence of SMR should be included in the POLS hypothesis; we therefore measured SMR at three temperatures from rest to preferred body temperature. Activity, aggressiveness, and risk taking, but not sociability, exhibited significant, short-term repeatability, and little correlation was found between behavioral traits. The SMR of lizards with a low metabolism at rest increased faster with body temperature. The SMR at rest was negatively correlated with behavioral variation in sociability and activity but not with risk-taking behavior. In addition, the plasma corticosterone level after an acute handling stress increased slightly but not significantly with aggressiveness. We discuss alternative interpretations for these relationships and conclude that the link between inter-individual variation in physiology and behavior is trait-dependent in the common lizard. Selection better promotes the evolution of consistent differences in behavior, or personalities, when they are coupled with differences in physiology. In adult common lizards, inter-individual differences in metabolic expenditure and glucocorticoid stress response are consistent and could play a crucial role in the maintenance of personalities. This study supported partially this hypothesis. We found that more sociable and active personality types had a lower metabolic expenditure, while more aggressive personality types tended to have a higher physiological stress response. At the same time, physiology was not correlated with individual differences in risk-taking behavior and drove little part of behavioral variation. The coupling between personalities and physiology appears to be trait-dependent, suggesting that behaviors may be relatively free to evolve independently from physiology.","10.1007/s00265-016-2117-z","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000376122600012",NA,"Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-5965-9868","Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/E-8702-2011",NA,249,179,270,"#000000",NA,""

However, the presence of consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones.

However, studies examining whether these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare. Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014 we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of personality on reproductive success differed between changing environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments.

We examined here the behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge). We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies. We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage, and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important, because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on differences between males and females, probably indicating on differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging. Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.","10.1007/s00265-016-2098-y","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000374563600010",NA,NA,NA,NA,254,62,5,"#405d99","selected",""

Thus, prey species should be able to discriminate between different predator types and adjust their response to the imminent predation risk. In our current study, we evaluated the relative importance of innate versus learned components of predator recognition and avoidance in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). We used a feral guppy population occurring in Germany and compared avoidance reactions of each focal individual towards both coevolved piscine predators from their original distribution range and novel, presently co-occurring predator species. Wild-caught, predator-experienced as well as laboratory-reared, predator-na < ve individuals showed strong avoidance responses towards all predator animations. Avoidance was stronger in small-bodied than in large-bodied individuals in both cohorts; however, this effect was significant only in predator-na < ve fish. Moreover, wild-caught individuals showed a significantly higher within-individual variance (across the six predator species) along with a lower among-individual variance in predator avoidance, which resulted in a lower behavioral repeatability in this cohort. Our results suggest that consistent individual differences in risk-taking behavior (also referred to as the personality trait `boldness') are modified by predator exposure and learning about predators.","10.1007/s10164-016-0460-1","0289-0771","1439-5444","ISI:000374170400008",NA,NA,NA,NA,255,454,465,"#000000",NA,""

Individual variation in baseline hormone levels or hormonal similarity within a breeding pair may be related to reproductive success, as suggested by the corticosterone-fitness hypothesis and the hormonal similarity hypothesis, respectively. In a population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) with repeatable behavioral expression and coordination of behavior within pairs, we tested if baseline androgen and corticosterone levels are related to behavioral expression, if coordination in behavior within pairs is facilitated by hormonal coordination, and if baseline hormone levels are related to fledging success at the individual or pair level. We found no significant relationship between hormone levels and nest visit rate or nest defense for either sex. Androgen and corticosterone levels were not correlated within pairs, but pairs in which males exhibited more aggressive nest defense behavior than females were also more different in androgen levels. Females with higher baseline corticosterone levels fledged more young, but hormonal similarity within pairs was not related to fledging success. Our results provide support for the corticosterone-adaptation hypothesis, which suggests that elevation of baseline corticosterone levels may occur during breeding to meet increased energetic demands.

In this study, we assessed boldness-indicating behaviors of Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis using individually conducted experiments measuring the time taken to explore a novel arena containing predator (burbot, Lota lota) cues. We studied if individual differences in boldness would explain vulnerability of individually tagged perch to experimental angling in outdoor ponds, or if fishing would impose selection on boldness-indicating behavior. Perch expressed repeatable individual differences in boldness-indicating behavior but the individual boldness-score (the first principal component) obtained using principal component analysis combining all the measured behavioral responses did not explain vulnerability to experimental angling.

Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks, Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects' participation and success were consistent within the same problems and across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise from inherent motivational differences alone and hence be achieved without inferring more complex cognitive processes.

Underlying this concept is the assumption that individuals will display consistent levels of performance in fitness-related traits and interest has focused on individual variation and broad sense repeatability in a range of behavioural and physiological traits. Despite playing a central role in maintenance and growth, and with considerable inter-individual variation documented, broad sense repeatability in rates of protein synthesis has not been assessed. In this study we show for the first time that juvenile flounder Platichthys flesus reared under controlled environmental conditions on the same plane of nutrition for 46 days maintain consistent whole-animal absolute rates of protein synthesis (A(s)). By feeding meals containing N-15-labelled protein and using a stochastic end-point model, two non-terminal measures of protein synthesis were made 32 days apart (d(14) and d(46)). A(s) values (mass-corrected to a standard mass of 12 g) showed 2- to 3-fold variation between individuals on d(14) and d(46) but individuals showed similar A(s) values on both days with a broad sense repeatability estimate of 0.684 indicating significant consistency in physiological performance under controlled experimental conditions. The use of non-terminal methodologies in studies of animal ecophysiology to make repeat measures of physiological performance enables known individuals to be tracked across changing conditions. Adopting this approach, repeat measures of protein synthesis under controlled conditions will allow individual ontogenetic changes in protein metabolism to be assessed to better understand the ageing process and to determine individual physiological adaptive capacity, and associated energetic costs of adaptation, to global environmental change.","10.1371/journal.pone.0152239","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000372807800035","e0152239","Owen, Stewart/0000-0003-1398-7142","McCarthy, Ian/B-4803-2012 ",NA,259,318,109,"#000000",NA,""

Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits.","10.1093/conphys/cow007","2051-1434",NA,"ISI:000375206900001","UNSP cow007","Adriaenssens, Bart/0000-0001-8631-2993","Adriaenssens, Bart/G-3552-2010",NA,260,144,427,"#000000",NA,""

Therefore, individuals are expected to choose a partner that is alike in behavioral type. However, mate searching is very costly and does not guarantee finding a matching partner. If mismatched individuals pair, they may benefit from increasing their similarity after pairing. We show in a monogamous fish species-the convict cichlid-that the behavioral similarity between mismatched partners can increase after pairing. This increase resulted from asymmetrical adjustment because only the reactive individual became more alike its proactive partner, whereas the latter did not change its behavior. The mismatched pairs that increased their similarity not only improved their reproductive success but also raised it up to the level of matched pairs. While most studies assume that assortative mating results from mate choice, our study suggests that postpairing adjustment could be an alternative explanation for the high behavioral similarity between partners observed in the field.

Individual differences in metabolic rate have been linked with variations in behaviour and key life-history traits and can affect ecological patterns within animal populations. Yet, almost nothing is known of the plasticity of the metabolic response under dynamically changing conditions that are representative of the natural environment. This is surprising since the capacity for animals to cope with rapidly changing environments depends on phenotypic variation and plasticity among members of the population. 2. We measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) of 60 juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) under acclimation conditions (35ppt salinity, 29 degrees C, normoxia) and when the fish were sequentially faced with low salinity (10ppt), high temperature (35 degrees C) and hypoxia (45\% air saturation) with each treatment separated by approximate to 12days. 3. The overall degree of interindividual variation in body-mass-standardised SMR, MMR and AS changed with environmental conditions, and a metabolic coupling was revealed between SMR and MMR when the fish were faced with the environmental changes. The metabolic response to environmental change differed widely and predictably at an individual level. Individuals that had elevated metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions showed little change in SMR, MMR or AS in response to low salinity and high temperature, but MMR and AS were greatly depressed by hypoxia. In contrast, individuals with low-metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions displayed a substantial increase in SMR, MMR and AS in response to high temperature and (to a lesser extent) low salinity, but hypoxia had very little effect. 4. These findings reveal how phenotypic diversity in key physiological traits can create differential plasticity towards environmental change within a population by showing how individual fish can remain metabolically insensitive to one environmental stressor at the cost of being highly sensitive to another.","10.1111/1365-2435.12503","0269-8463","1365-2435","ISI:000372949000004",NA,"Clark, Timothy/0000-0001-8738-3347","Malte, Hans/J-6018-2013 Clark, Timothy/K-7129-2012",NA,263,171,649,"#000000",NA,""

Owls showed a considerable individual consistency in all movement parameters and made repeated use of similar routes while moving within fixed home ranges. Thus, movement parameters varied much less between repeated nightly trajectories than between different individuals. Furthermore, when we compared different individuals inhabiting the same territory in different years, within-group repeatability was low or non-significant suggesting that the spatial configuration of habitat does not always represents one of the main drivers in animal movement behaviour. Similarly, male individuals appeared to exhibit greater repeatability than females.

We used random coefficients in resource selection functions (RSFs) and repeatability estimates to test for variability in habitat selection. We applied our method to a detailed dataset of GPS relocations of brown bears (Ursus arctos) taken over a period of 6 years, and assessed whether they displayed repeatable individual differences in habitat selection toward two habitat types: bogs and recent timber-harvest cut blocks. In our analyses, we controlled for the availability of habitat, i.e. the functional response in habitat selection. Repeatability estimates of habitat selection toward bogs and cut blocks were 0.304 and 0.420, respectively. Therefore, 30.4 and 42.0 \% of the population-scale habitat selection variability for bogs and cut blocks, respectively, was due to differences among individuals, suggesting that consistent individual variation in habitat selection exists in brown bears. Using simulations, we posit that repeatability values of habitat selection are not related to the value and significance of beta estimates in RSFs. Although individual differences in habitat selection could be the results of non-exclusive factors, our results illustrate the evolutionary potential of habitat selection.","10.1007/s00442-015-3500-6","0029-8549","1432-1939","ISI:000371637000007",NA,"Leclerc, Martin/0000-0002-4429-697X Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524",NA,NA,266,463,27,"#405d99","selected","habitat selection"

In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed to estimate the individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for marsh harriers. This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for marsh harriers (corridor migration) and a higher degree of repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among marsh harriers, while individual ospreys were more flexible. Our findings suggest that individuality in space and time is not a shared trait complex among migrants, but may show adaptive variation depending on the species' life history and ecology.

The ``killer shrimp{''} Dikerogammarus villosus is a highly predatory amphipod that has spread readily across Central Europe and recently the UK and its arrival has been associated with the significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its behavioral ecology are sparse, even though its behavior may contribute to its invasion success. For the first time, we investigated antipredator ``fleeing{''} behavior in D. villosus and how this changed with water temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis. First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but consistent among-individual differences in behavior. These are driven by a combination of mean level among-individual differences and within-individual relative consistency in behavior, and provide the key marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were not influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus, indicating a capacity for individual learning. We suggest that the antipredator behavior of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and that consistent among-individual differences in behavior may promote biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous, particularly in an era of global climate change, where average temperatures could be elevated and less predictable.","10.1093/cz/zov001","1674-5507","2396-9814","ISI:000374258900007",NA,"Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538","Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013",NA,268,509,619,"#000000",NA,""

Lizards from one of the urban populations were more active, and more likely to forage for food, than individuals from the other three populations, but there was no difference in activity or foraging behaviour between urban and non-urban populations overall. Skinks from urban and non-urban habitats did not differ in their exploratory or basking behaviours. Activity, exploratory behaviour and foraging behaviour were all repeatable, and a behavioural syndrome linking high activity with increased exploration was evident. Our study documents the impact of urbanization on an understudied taxonomic group in the Southern Hemisphere, where urbanization has occurred relatively recently, and suggests that the influence on behaviour might be related to the degree of urbanization that has occurred.","10.1111/jzo.12288","0952-8369","1469-7998","ISI:000369997200004",NA,NA,NA,NA,269,606,424,"#000000",NA,""

Deliberate introductions of non-native species offer opportunities to investigate how such genes differ between native and introduced populations and how polymorphisms in the genes are related to variation in behaviour. Here, we compared the genetic variation of the two personality' genes, DRD4 and SERT, between a native (United Kingdom, UK) and an introduced (New Zealand, NZ) population of dunnocks, Prunella modularis. The NZ population showed a significantly lower number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the UK population. Standardized F'(st) estimates of the personality genes and neutral microsatellites indicate that selection (anthropogenic and natural) probably occurred during and post the introduction event. Notably, the largest genetic differentiation was found in the intronic regions of the genes. In the NZ population, we also examined the association between polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT and two highly repeatable behavioural traits: flight-initiation distance and mating status (promiscuous females and cobreeding males). We found 38 significant associations (for different allele effect models) between the two behavioural traits and the studied genes. Further, 22 of the tested associations showed antagonistic allele effects for males and females. Our findings illustrate how introduction events and accompanying ecological changes could influence the genetic diversity of behaviour-related genes.","10.1111/mec.13514","0962-1083","1365-294X","ISI:000369869600004",NA,"Santos, Eduardo/0000-0002-0434-3655 Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182 Lara, Carlos Esteban/0000-0001-5425-0935","Santos, Eduardo/B-4449-2008 Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011 IB/USP, Zoologia/G-1759-2017 ",NA,270,449,12,"#405d99","selected",""

However, little attention has been paid to possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial. These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role of social carryover effects.

Shoaling and risk taking were repeatable within individuals in both experimental and control fish. Individual willingness to shoal increased over time in both experimental and control groups, but there was no evidence that shoaling changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this behaviour is plastic.

Sleep reactivity has been termed a ``trait-like{''} vulnerability; however, evidence of its long-term stability is lacking. The main objective of the current psychometric study was to investigate the temporal stability of the FIRST over two 6-mo intervals in a population-based sample of adults with and without insomnia. The temporal stability of the FIRST was also compared with the temporal stability of other scales associated with insomnia (trait-anxiety, arousability). Methods: Participants included 1,122 adults (mean age = 49.9 y, standard deviation = 14.8; 38.8\% male) presenting with an insomnia syndrome (n = 159), insomnia symptoms (n = 152), or good sleep (n = 811). Participants completed the FIRST, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait-anxiety), and the Arousal Predisposition Scale (arousability) on three different occasions: baseline and at 6-and 12-mo follow-up. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed for all scales (baseline to 6 mo and 6 to 12 mo). Results: The FIRST yielded strong temporal stability from baseline to 6 mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.81), symptoms (ICC = 0.78), and good sleep (ICC = 0.81). Similar results were observed for 6 to 12 mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.74), insomnia symptoms (ICC = 0.82), and good sleep (ICC = 0.84). The stability of the FIRST was not comparable with the stability of trait-anxiety, but was somewhat comparable with the stability of arousability. Conclusions: Overall, the FIRST is a temporally reliable stable scale over 6-mo intervals. Future research is needed to corroborate the stability and trait-like measures of sleep reactivity with physiological, behavioural and personality measures.","10.5664/jcsm.6192","1550-9389","1550-9397","ISI:000389993900008",NA,"Drake, Christopher/0000-0002-5486-3587","Drake, Christopher/L-6274-2017",NA,273,572,116,"#000000",NA,""

We used a repeated measures approach, assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support for among-individual variation in metabolic traits.

The struggle test was effective, and repeatable inter-individual docility differences were observed.

Individuals that differ consistently in their behaviours from others of the same population are considered to exhibit different personalities. Personality can be easily quantified with repeat tests on animals held in captivity. However, captive-based tests may not always be possible for logistical reasons and tests conducted in captivity can alter naturally occurring behaviours. Development of methods to assess personality in the field over short-term capture is an important alternative to long-term captive tests. Aims To develop and refine field-based tests that can be used to easily define personality traits of wild common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), eliminating the need to bring individuals into captivity for an extended period of time. Methods We developed a series of short-term capture protocols to quantify personality traits of the common brushtail possum in the field, using handling-bag tests, modified open-field tests, trap-behaviour tests and release tests. Key results Personality traits of brushtail possums could be measured in several different ways, but refining methods was crucial to reveal traits efficiently. Behaviours related to several personality traits (boldness, docility and activity/exploration) could be measured rapidly in the field with our methods, and were repeatable over time. Conclusions Rapid, reliable and easy-to-perform quantification of personality of brushtail possums in the field is possible. This may sometimes be the only available option, and has advantages over long captive trials in terms of animal welfare and cost.

Even in cases where a person stands in no relation to another particular person, but with a particular authority or an organized community of citizens, a public organization, s/he ultimately comes in a certain relationship with another person. Distinctive features of social relations are commonness and repeatability. It is generally accepted that the part of the spectrum of social relations regulated by the law is called legal relations. The law cannot regulate all relations between people in the literal sense. Interpersonal relations in everyday life, neighbor relations, friendship, intimate relations between a husband and a wife: this is not a complete list of relations between people that are not governed by the law, but at the same time play an important role in everyone's life. Every person since his/her birth enters the system of already established and settled legal relations. In any case, any legal relations are the result of conscious human activity. At the heart of every relationship is a conscious activity of people. This is the first point the author focuses his attention on. Public relations becoming legal ones acquire a number of new properties. Since legal relations are those established by the state, they are not only the content of certain legal norms, but they also receive a mandatory property of their execution. The government initially lays a possibility of legal enforcement in the rule of law and the resulting legal relations, because it is common knowledge that the rule of law without the possibility of its forced execution is actually no longer the rule of law: it is a well-intentioned wish, recommendation, advice, but not the rule of law. Another feature of legal relations is that by regulating relations between people they generally govern relations that are socially desirable and approved. At the same time, however, socially censured actions, actions that violate the requirements of legal norms: offenses and, in their extreme form, crimes, are not excluded. Still, law-abiding and infringing behavior is a result of the behavior of specific individuals, their intentional motivated behavior. Thus, any behavioral act regulated by a legal norm should distinguish actions themselves and their results: the impact of actions and the personality of the subject who committed these actions. Indeed, all actions are committed by a person. This is the second point the author focuses his attention on.","10.17223/15617793/402/26","1561-7793","1561-803X","ISI:000379505100026",NA,NA,"Vedernikov, Nikolay/O-8387-2014",NA,278,4,410,"#000000",NA,""

Ratings of observed social disinhibition were correlated with the disinhibition domain scores of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Disinhibition (NPI-D) and with Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS) scores. A regression analysis was undertaken to determine whether formal measures of disinhibition could predict observed disinhibition. Results: The interrater absolute agreement for the social disinhibition ratings was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = .69. Participants with TBI were rated as significantly more disinhibited than comparison participants, t(25.05) = -2.07, p = .049. The ratings were positively correlated with the NPI frequency score (r = .45, p = .038) and distress score (r = .45, p = .035). The ratings were not related to change in employment or in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS, and formal measures of disinhibition were unable to predict observed social disinhibition.

We tested how individual climbing tendency was related to the event of fishway passage experienced in the field and classified fish climbing profiles as climbing `leaders', `followers', `finishers' and `no climbers'. Moreover, we analysed the brain transcription level of genes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and compared it to climbing profiles. We found that fish from the upstream segments of an impounded river had a higher climbing propensity. Their behaviour was also more repeatable throughout the whole test than the obstacle-naive fish from the downstream segment. Moreover, we found that boldly climbing `leaders' had lower levels of transcription of synapse-related genes than the climbing `followers'. These differences could be related to coping styles of fish, where proactive `leaders' express a routine and risky behaviour, whereas reactive fish need an environmental assessment before exploratory behaviour.

Recently, it has been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result, certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications-from the way we conduct ecological research to the management and conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable? Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing) in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5 behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of animals to novelty.","10.1093/beheco/arv123","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000374768300014",NA,NA,NA,NA,281,342,45,"#000000",NA,""

Estimates of repeatability of emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions. Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as well as morphology.","10.1163/1568539X-00003343","0005-7959","1568-539X","ISI:000371351300004",NA,"Brown, Gregory/0000-0002-2924-9040","Brown, Gregory/F-9897-2011",NA,284,88,177,"#000000",NA,""

When females were unexposed to fluoxetine, boldness was consistent within a context and correlated across assays. Fluoxetine exposure affected behavior within and among individuals on multiple levels. Exposure reduced overall boldness levels, made females behave in a less consistent manner, and significantly reduced correlations over time and across contexts. Fluoxetine exerted its effects on female Betta splendens behavior in a dose-dependent fashion and these effects persisted even after females were housed in clean water. If fluoxetine exposure impacts behaviors such as exploration that are necessary to an individual's success, this may yield evolutionary consequences. In conclusion, the results show that fluoxetine exposure alters behavior beyond the level of overall response and highlights the importance of studying the behavioral effects of inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure in multiple contexts and with different dosing regimes.","10.1007/s10646-015-1568-8","0963-9292","1573-3017","ISI:000370715500007",NA,"Dzieweczynski, Teresa/0000-0002-5182-9914",NA,NA,285,244,26,"#405d99","selected","boldness, treatments"

In Spain, the Pura Raza Espanol horse (PRE) Breeding Program focuses mainly on the selection of horses for satisfactory dressage ability. Studying the genetic parameters of eye temperature (ET) using infrared thermography (IR) as an indicator of stress in horses could highlight the suitability of this parameter to be included as a selection criterion in the PRE Breeding Program. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of ET measured with IR in Young Horse Dressage tests (YHDT) from the Breeding Program. Accordingly, 343 PRE were measured during 3 YHDT final competitions held in Spain. From these animals, 1746 ET measurements were taken on 3 different moments during each competition: 3 h before the competition (ET\_B), just after the competition (<5 min after the dressage exercise) (ET\_JA), and 3 h after the competition, when the animal was resting (ET\_A). Moreover, 6 different dressage score records were taken for each animal during the competitions: walk, trot, canter, general impression, submission and total score. The genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian procedure. The environmental effects (Age, Stud, Trip, Training, Event-Year and Rider) that were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for each temperature trait were used in the genetic models. The pedigree file included a total of 3350 PRE. The correlations between the ET and expected breeding values for dressage (EBV), as well as the coincidence between the animals' genetic rankings by their EBV, were also studied. Heritabilities for temperature traits ranged from 0.14 (ET\_JA) to 0.50 (ET\_A), while heritabilities for performance traits ranged from 0.44 (walk) to 0.37 (submission) and repeatability ranged from 0.25 (ET\_JA) to 0.79 (walk). The dressage EBV and the ET EBV just after exercise showed statistically significant correlations with r(2) = 0.21. Finally, the range of matching animals was higher (from 17\% to 40\%) when the top 25\% of the animals for both parameters was selected. Our findings indicate that the selection of the best animals for dressage performance would also involve selecting the animals with higher ET values, showing a higher level of physiological stress. Hence, despite selection using ET in horses is achievable, more evidence about its validity, sensitivity and specificity is still needed in order to include ET as an additional selection criteria in Breeding Programs.

Parasitism is known to significantly influence the evolution of animal personality at least in part because more explorative individuals may meet parasites more frequently than less explorative ones. Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and exploration) were repeatable. Furthermore, firebugs with a stronger immune response behaved more boldly but also less actively. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We failed to find support for a maladaptive spillover of voracious female personality. While females exhibited consistent inter-individual differences in voracity towards prey, voracity did not correlate with female aggressiveness towards males. Instead, we show that female D. fimbriatus adjusted their tendency to attack courting males according to their size relative to the male. Females commonly attacked males during or after copulation, but sexual cannibalism depended on relative mate size difference, with mating success tending to be compromised in females with lower body weight.

Urban animals are often less wary of humans than their non-urban counterparts, which could be explained by habituation, adaptation or local site selection. Under local site selection, individuals that are less tolerant of humans are less likely to settle in urban areas. However, there is little evidence for such temperament-based site selection, and even less is known about its underlying genetic basis. We tested whether site selection in urban and non-urban habitats by black swans (Cygnus atratus) was associated with polymorphisms in two genes linked to fear in animals, the dopamine receptor D-4 (DRD4) and serotonin transporter (SERT) genes. Results: Wariness in swans was highly repeatable between disturbance events (repeatability = 0.61) and non-urban swans initiated escape from humans earlier than urban swans. We found no inter-individual variation in the SERT gene, but identified five DRD4 genotypes and an association between DRD4 genotype and wariness. Individuals possessing the most common DRD4 genotype were less wary than individuals possessing rarer genotypes. As predicted by the local site selection hypothesis, genotypes associated with wary behaviour were over three times more frequent at the non-urban site. This resulted in moderate population differentiation at DRD4 (F-ST = 0.080), despite the sites being separated by only 30 km, a short distance for this highly-mobile species. Low population differentiation at neutrally-selected microsatellite loci and the likely occasional migration of swans between the populations reduces the likelihood of local site adaptations. Conclusion: Our results suggest that wariness in swans is partly genetically-determined and that wary swans settle in less-disturbed areas. More generally, our findings suggest that site-specific management strategies may be necessary that consider the temperament of local animals.","10.1186/s12862-015-0533-8","1471-2148",NA,"ISI:000366169100001","253","Robinson, Randall/0000-0001-8425-0709",NA,NA,290,644,160,"#000000",NA,""

For instance, direct environmental effects during ontogeny (phenotypic plasticity) as the proximate mechanism behind the emergence of consistent individual differences in behavior are usually overlooked compared to environmental effects operating across generations (genetic adaptation). Here, we tested the effects of sociality and perceived predation risk during ontogeny on the strength of behavioral consistency in agile frog (Rana dalmatina) tadpoles in a factorial common garden experiment. Tadpoles reared alone and without predatory cues showed zero repeatability within (i.e., lack of personality) and zero correlation between (i.e., lack of syndrome) activity and risk-taking. On the other hand, cues from predators alone induced both activity and risk-taking personalities, while cues from predators and conspecifics together resulted in an activity - risk-taking behavioral syndrome. Our results show that individual experience has an unequivocal role in the emergence of behavioral consistency. In this particular case, the development of behavioral consistency was most likely the result of genotype 9 environment interactions, or with other words, individual variation in behavioral plasticity.","10.1002/ece3.1804","2045-7758",NA,"ISI:000368136600010",NA,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Hettyey, Attila/0000-0003-0678-0936","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 ",NA,291,374,120,"#000000",NA,""

We conducted experiments to determine whether checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may underlie the behaviours and performance tested.

Individual consistency in behavioural responses to challenge has been documented across the animal kingdom. Comparatively few studies, however, have examined inter-individual variation in the physiological response, namely glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels, the stress hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively. Variation in coping styles between individuals may be explained in part by differences in social rank and sex. Using 20 Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrota) we: (1) investigated the existence of consistent inter-individual variation in exploratory behaviour and the hormonal stress response, and tested for correlations as predicted by the coping styles hypothesis; and (2) evaluated whether inter-individual behavioural and hormonal variation is related to social rank and sex. Salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase, chromogranin A) were assessed in the presence and absence of a stressor consisting of social isolation in a crate for 10 min. Principal components analysis on a set of behavioural variables revealed two traits, which we labelled exploratory tendency and neophobia. Neither exploratory tendency nor neophobia predicted the physiological stress response. Subordinate pigs exhibited higher catecholamine levels compared to dominant conspecifics. We observed sex differences in the repeatability of salivary stress markers and reactivity of the stress systems. The results do not provide support for the existence of behavioural physiological coping styles in pigs. Sex is an important determinant of the physiological stress response and warrants consideration in research addressing behavioural and hormonal variation.

Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly.

Although clinical screeners categorically ascertain risk of ASD in early childhood, rapid methods for quantitative measurement of RSB in toddlers are not yet established. Such measurements are critical for tracking developmental trajectories and incremental responses to intervention. Methods: We developed and validated a 20-min video-referenced rating scale, the video-referenced rating of reciprocal social behavior (vrRSB), for untrained caregivers to provide standardized ratings of quantitative variation in RSB. Parents of 252 toddler twins {[}Monozygotic (MZ) = 31 pairs, Dizygotic (DZ) = 95 pairs] ascertained through birth records, rated their twins' RSB at two time points, on average 6 months apart, and completed two developmental measures, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory Short Form (MCDI-s). Results: Scores on the vrRSB were fully continuously distributed, with excellent 6-month test-retest reliability ({[}intraclass correlation coefficient] ICC = 0.704, p < .000). MZ twins displayed markedly greater trait concordance than DZ twins, (MZ ICC = 0.863, p < .000, DZ ICC = 0.231, p < .012). VrRSB score distributions were highly distinct for children passing versus failing the M-CHAT (t = -8.588, df = 31, p < .000), incrementally improved from 18-24 months, and were inversely correlated with receptive and expressive vocabulary on the MCDI-s. Conclusions: Like quantitative autistic trait ratings in school-aged children and adults, toddler scores on the vrRSB are continuously distributed and appear highly heritable. These ratings exhibited minimal measurement error, high inter-individual stability, and developmental progression in RSB as children matured from 18-24 months, supporting their potential utility for serially quantifying the severity of early autistic syndromes over time and in response to intervention. In addition, these findings inform the genetic-environmental structure of RSB in early typical development.","10.1111/jcpp.12391","0021-9630","1469-7610","ISI:000366512300008",NA,NA,NA,NA,296,470,341,"#000000",NA,""

One way to understand the evolution of such a group-level phenomenon is to compare horizontally patterns of correlations among populations (or species) or follow longitudinally the same population over years in the light of parallel differences in the environment. We applied the longitudinal approach to 8-year field data and analyzed phenotypic correlations, and their within- and between-individual components, among three behaviors (novelty avoidance, aggression, and risk-taking) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, in a meta-analytic framework. The phenotypic correlation between novelty avoidance and aggression varied heterogeneously (it was positive in some years, while it was negative in other years), while the other pair-wise correlations were consistently positive over the study period. We investigated four potential socio-ecological factors, and found evidence that the among-year alterations in the demographic structure of the population (density, age composition) can be responsible for the heterogeneous effect sizes. Comparing within- and between-individual correlations across pairs of traits, we found that the correlation between aggression and risk-taking at the among-individual level was the strongest suggesting that this relationship has the highest potential to form a behavioral syndrome. Within-year repeatabilities varied among traits, but were systematically higher than between-year repeatabilities. Our study highlights on an empirical basis that there can be several biological and statistical reasons behind detecting a phenotypic correlation in a study, but only few of these imply that fixed behavioral syndromes are maintained in a natural population.

Although older, experienced individuals often occupy keystone roles such as leader or dominant individual, few studies have performed manipulations to study their impact. Here, we investigate how juvenile collective foraging behaviour is influenced by adult presence in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. Our manipulation of age demography revealed that the presence of a few mature females drastically increased a groups' foraging aggressiveness, demonstrating that adults indeed act as keystone individuals in juvenile spider groups. Interestingly, the magnitude of their positive impact on collective foraging was mediated by group size: adult presence shortened latency to attack prey more strongly in large groups than in small groups. Conversely, adult presence increased the number of attackers only in small groups. Surprisingly, intergroup variation in collective foraging, which is known to be consistent in mature social spiders, was not repeatable in juvenile groups. Thus, juvenile groups seem to behave more erratically or need more time to develop collective personalities. Together, our results suggest that adult presence can have profound, catalytic effects on juvenile collective foraging behaviour, and that these effects are modulated by group size.

Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Current literature indicates pain as a common experience for children with IDD, yet no such reports have been made in regard to adults with IDD. Purposes This study aimed (1) to re-establish the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers; (2) to evaluate the pain experience of adults with IDD by caregivers' proxy report; and (3) to assess the sensitivity of the Non-Communicating Adult Pain Checklist (NCAPC) as a pain scale for chronic pain (CP) in individuals with IDD. Method Frothy-three caregivers, working for more than 3 years with adults with IDD, performed pain assessments of 187 individuals living in a residential facility. Two caregivers evaluated whether each resident suffers from pain and assessed the intensity, causes and duration of pain experience. Further-more, 52/187 residents {[}26 with CP and 26 pain free (PF) based on medical record and caregiver reports] were evaluated by an additional seven caregivers using the NCAPC in order to establish the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers. Results According to caregivers' report, 48\% of adults with IDD suffer from pain at a mean level of 6/10, with more than 10\% suffering from high levels of pain on a constant basis. Inter-rater agreement was found mostly high with intraclass correlation values ranging between 0.73 and 0.93. Using the NCAPC, we were able to identify CP and PF individuals with a significant score difference (P = 0.003). Conclusions The results support the use of the NCAPC as a scale to evaluate CP in adults with IDD. The findings reiterate the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers and the importance of involving them in identifying pain behaviours of their protegees.

Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here, we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals. Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However individuals can also differ in their intra-individual (residual) variation, but to our knowledge, this has only been studied once before in free-living animals. Here we studied the distances moved and changes in nest height and concealment between successive nesting attempts of marked pairs of grey fantails (Rhipidura albiscapa) in relation to nest fate, across the breeding season. We predicted that females (gender that decides where the nest is placed) should on average show adaptive behavioral responses to the experience of prior predation risk such that after an unsuccessful nesting attempt, replacement nests should be further away, higher from the ground, and more concealed compared with replacement nests after successful nesting attempts. We found that, on average, females moved greater distances to re-nest after unsuccessful nesting attempts (abandoned or depredated) in contrast to after a successful attempt, suggesting that re-nesting decisions are sensitive to risk. We found no consistent across-individual differences in distances moved, heights, or concealment. However, females differed by 53-fold (or more) in their intra-individual variability (i.e., predictability) with respect to distances moved and changes in nest height between nesting attempts, indicating that either some systematic variation went unexplained and/or females have inherently different predictability. Ignoring these individual differences in residual variance in our models obscured the effect of nest fate on re-nesting decisions that were evident at the mean level.","10.1007/s00265-015-1974-1","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000360845600007",NA,"Beckmann, Christa/0000-0002-7904-7228","Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009 Beckmann, Christa/G-2754-2012",NA,303,269,425,"#000000",NA,""

This practice produces a readily available clumped resource for many scavengers such as seabirds, but in the face of declining stocks and via policy change, the amount of discards produced is set to decline in the future. To understand how discards have influenced seabird foraging in the past and how birds may respond to future change requires studies examining consistent individual foraging choices. There is increasing evidence that populations may be made up of generalist or specialist foragers and this is key to the population's ability to adapt to change. Here we test for consistent individual foraging behaviour of northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to fishing vessels and examine consequences of scavenging behaviour in terms of foraging effort and body condition. Using a combination of bird-borne bio-logging devices (GPS and Time Depth Recorders) with high resolution GPS data acquired through vessel monitoring systems on fishing boats, we examined the overlap between birds and fisheries. We found that during repeat foraging trips in the same breeding season, gannets regularly foraged at fishing boats but there were also clear among individual differences in the extent of fisheries overlap. Furthermore, we show for the first time that these differences represent consistent strategies - individual differences in scavenging were highly repeatable across multiple trips within a period of several weeks. However, despite this finding, we found no differences in foraging effort or body condition between scavengers and non-scavengers. Moreover, scavenging strategy did not appear to influence diving behaviour or vary by sex. Scavenging on discards appears to be a strategy employed consistently by a subsection of the population and future work should examine whether these specialisations persist throughout and between years and what causes these individual differences, exploring possible demographic and fitness consequences in light of global changes to fish stocks and fisheries management.","10.1111/jav.00660","0908-8857","1600-048X","ISI:000363732600001",NA,"Grecian, James/0000-0002-6428-719X Votier, Stephen/0000-0002-0976-0167 Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129","Grecian, James/A-7689-2012 ",NA,305,304,519,"#000000",NA,""

If it stays, it may decide to freeze or display a threat and if it displays a threat, it may choose from several alternative forms of display. Here we argue that instead of being analyzed using traditional nonparametric statistics or a series of separate analyses split by response categories, this kind of data can be more holistically analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework extended to binomial response trees. Originally devised for the social sciences to analyze questionnaires with multiple-choice answers, this approach can easily be applied to behavioral data using existing GLMM software.

Fluctuating selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we investigated the relationship between individual personality differences and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a 1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability. Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.","10.1093/beheco/arv074","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000361373500012",NA,"THIBAULT, Martin/0000-0002-2386-4501","Baudry, Emmanuelle/G-4005-2010 ",NA,307,573,274,"#000000",NA,""

Given recent climate change and the degree of habitat modification currently experienced by many organisms, it is therefore critical to quantify the degree of phenotypic variation present within populations, individual capacities to change and what their consequences are for fitness. Flexibility in standard metabolic rate (SMR) may be particularly important since SMR reflects the minimal energetic cost of living and is one of the primary traits underlying organismal performance. SMR can increase or decrease in response to food availability, but the consequences of these changes for growth rates and other fitness components are not well known. We examined individual variation in metabolic flexibility in response to changing food levels and its consequences for somatic growth in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). SMR increased when individuals were switched to a high food ration and decreased when they were switched to a low food regime. These shifts in SMR, in turn, were linked with individual differences in somatic growth; those individuals that increased their SMR more in response to elevated food levels grew fastest, while growth at the low food level was fastest in those individuals that depressed their SMR most. Flexibility in energy metabolism is therefore a key mechanism to maximize growth rates under the challenges imposed by variability in food availability and is likely to be an important determinant of species' resilience in the face of global change.","10.1111/1365-2656.12384","0021-8790","1365-2656","ISI:000360093400026",NA,"Metcalfe, Neil/0000-0002-1970-9349 Salin, Karine/0000-0002-3368-9639","Metcalfe, Neil/C-5997-2009 ",NA,308,242,10,"#993f3f","excluded",""

Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as `breeders' and `nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and `escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In this paper, we devise a framework for describing the behavioral phenomenon, betweenindividual/between-population variation, and between/across context variation. This framework can be used to give unique definitions of the three terms, supported by previous literature, giving clarity moving forward in the field of animal behavior. Abstract: Ethologists use a variety of terminology such as ``personality{''}, ``temperament{''} and `` behavioral syndromes{'' almost interchangeably to discuss the phenomenon of individuals within a population of animals consistently varying from one another in their behavioral responses to stimuli. This interchangeable usage of terminology has contributed to confusion within the field of animal behavior and limits the study of the phenomenon. Here we use a rapid, non-exhaustive and repeatable search strategy literature review to investigate where there were unique distinctions between these three terms and where there was an overlap in their usage. We identified three main areas of confusion in terminology: historical usage which is not updated; a lack of precision between different fields of study; and a lack of precision between different levels of variation. We propose a framework with which to understand and define the terms based on the levels of variation ethologists are interested in. Consistent individual animal behavioral variation relates to the different structures of variation of between-individual/between-population and between and across contexts. By formalizing this framework we provide clarity between the three terms which can be easily defined and understood.","10.3390/ani5030366","2076-2615",NA,"ISI:000422944700001",NA,"MacKay, Jill/0000-0001-7134-4829","MacKay, Jill/L-3102-2016",NA,310,130,338,"#000000",NA,""

The presence of age-related plasticity in behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of study in many systems.

Such within-individual behavioral variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual's phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate on among-individual variation and present examples for how variation in corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness, and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to environments. In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm approaches might be a fruitful way forward. We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the functional implications and the evolution of hormone-behavior relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals. This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust hormonally-mediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions.","10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S7","1742-9994",NA,"ISI:000363472300007","S7","Goymann, Wolfgang/0000-0002-7553-5910",NA,NA,312,208,346,"#000000",NA,""

Here we explore the possibility to integrate offspring separation (distress) calls into the study of consistent individual differences in behaviour in two species of mammals, the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) and the mound-building mouse (Mus spicilegus). Such vocal responses in young mammals are a potentially useful test option as they represent an important element of mother-offspring communication with strong implications for offspring survival. In addition, the neural control of vocalisation is closely associated with emotional state. Results: We found marked similarities in the pattern of individual responses of the young of both species to separation from their mother and littermates. In the domestic cat as well as in the mound-building mouse, individual differences in the frequency of calls and to a lesser extent in locomotor activity were repeatable across age, indicating the existence of personality types. Such consistencies across age were also apparent when only considering relative individual differences among litter siblings. In both species, however, individual patterns of vocalisation and locomotor activity were unrelated. This suggests that these two forms of behavioural responses to isolation represent different domains of personality, presumably based on different underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Conclusions: Brief separation experiments in young mammals, and particularly the measurement of separation calls, provide a promising approach to study the ontogeny of personality traits. Future long-term studies are needed to investigate the association of these traits with biologically meaningful and potentially repeatable elements of behaviour during later life.","10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S12","1742-9994",NA,"ISI:000363472300012","S12","Banszegi, Oxana/0000-0002-1704-3539 Rodel, Heiko/0000-0003-0228-2884 Hudson, Robyn/0000-0002-5526-9555",NA,NA,313,553,104,"#000000",NA,""

It is unknown, for example, what physiological traits make some individual fish more susceptible to capture by commercial fisheries. Active fishing methods such as trawling pursue fish during harvest attempts, causing fish to use both aerobic steady-state swimming and anaerobic burst-type swimming to evade capture. Using simulated trawling procedures with schools of wild minnows Phoxinus phoxinus, we investigate two key questions to the study of fisheries-induced evolution that have been impossible to address using large-scale trawls: (i) are some individuals within a fish shoal consistently more susceptible to capture by trawling than others?; and (ii) if so, is this related to individual differences in swimming performance and metabolism? Results provide the first evidence of repeatable variation in susceptibility to trawling that is strongly related to anaerobic capacity and swimming ability. Maximum aerobic swim speed was also negatively correlated with vulnerability to trawling. Standard metabolic rate was highest among fish that were least vulnerable to trawling, but this relationship probably arose through correlations with anaerobic capacity. These results indicate that vulnerability to trawling is linked to anaerobic swimming performance and metabolic demand, drawing parallels with factors influencing susceptibility to natural predators. Selection on these traits by fisheries could induce shifts in the fundamental physiological makeup and function of descendent populations.","10.1098/rspb.2015.0603","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000362050000019","20150603","Killen, Shaun/0000-0003-4949-3988",NA,NA,315,649,1,"#993f3f","excluded","behaviour unclear"

As part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993) suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus, referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample of domestic piglets (n = 3555). By using a statistical resampling analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26 days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably represents a unimodal distribution with a `ceiling-effect'. The intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation (r(S)) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r(S) = 0.19-0.45, p < 0.001; R = 0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum from active to passive coping behaviour. This means that individuals show both behavioural consistency and flexibility in behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As cognitive remediation (CR) has recently been found to improve cognition in younger patients with schizophrenia, we investigated the efficacy, feasibility, and fidelity of a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program in youth with 22q11DS. Methods: A longitudinal design was implemented in which 21 participants served as their own controls. Following an eight month baseline period in which no interventions were provided, cognitive coaches met with participants remotely for CR via video conferencing three times a week over a targeted 8 month timeframe and facilitated their progress through the intervention, offering task-specific strategies. A subset of strategies were examined for fidelity. Outcomes were evaluated using a neurocognitive test battery at baseline, pre-treatment and post-treatment. Results: All participants adhered to the intervention. The mean length of the treatment phase was 7.96 months. A moderately high correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73) was found for amount and type of strategies offered by coaches. Participants exhibited significant improvements (ES=.36-.55, p <=.009) in working memory, shifting attention and cognitive flexibility. All significant models were driven by improvements in pre to post-treatment scores. Conclusions: Based on our preliminary investigation, a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program can be implemented with 22q11DS youth despite geographic location, health, and cognitive deficits. It appears effective in enhancing cognitive skills during the developmental period of adolescence, making this type of CR delivery useful for youth with 22q11DS transitioning into post-school environments.

First, individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves. We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional relationships between individual behavior and energetics.","10.1007/s00265-015-1947-4","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000358734700011",NA,NA,NA,NA,318,578,642,"#000000",NA,""

The first steps have been taken to characterize sleep in free-living birds, but it is unclear to what extent these results can be generalized between species. To describe sleep behaviour in the wild, we videorecorded great tits, Parus major, in their roosting boxes during two consecutive winters and individuals in captivity for comparison. Here, we examined endogenous and exogenous correlates of sleep behaviour in free-living great tits and addressed the potential confounding issues of studying avian sleep in captivity. Like that in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, sleep behaviour in great tits was strongly related to season, and was affected by sex, age and the environment. Although literature suggests relationships between sleep and risk-taking behaviours, possibly arising from stable differences in physiological state, sleep behaviour appeared to be plastic in great tits, and was not predicted by between-individual variation in exploratory tendencies. Captive tits initiated sleep later than wild individuals, even under natural photoperiodic conditions, suggesting that captivity alters timing and duration of sleep in great tits. Long-term repeatability in sleep behaviour was low for all variables, except morning latency (high repeatability) and evening box entry time, evening latency and frequency of awakenings (no detectable repeatability). Variation in sleep behaviour may largely represent within-individual differences in daily sleep requirements. Our study describes how different observable components of sleep are intercorrelated by providing evidence for significant within-individual correlations between sleep behaviours, which represent the integration of plasticity between traits. Consistent with low repeatability, low between-individual correlations suggest substantial behavioural plasticity in sleep, rather than a correlational structure leading to clear sleep `syndromes'. Our study provides quantitative evidence for the factors producing phenotypic plasticity in behavioural sleep in an ecological context. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Three main hypotheses have been suggested to explain the evolution of behavioral syndromes. The constraint hypothesis suggests that behaviors originate from a shared mechanism with a strong genetic or physiological basis. In contrast, according to the adaptive hypothesis, behavioral syndromes depend on specific selective pressures in each environment, and thus should evolve when specific behavioral combinations are advantageous. Finally, behavioral syndromes can also arise owing to neutral stochastic processes. We tested here for variation in the foraging syndromes of pit-building antlions originating from different populations along a climatic gradient. Although inter-population variation existed in some traits, foraging syndromes were similar across populations, supporting the constraint hypothesis. These findings suggest that stabilizing selection, acting on the foraging behavior of antlions during their larval phase, outweighs local selection pressures, resulting in ``constraint syndromes.{''} We also explored behavioral repeatability of foraging-related traits within and among habitats (natural, novel and disturbed habitats), and detected different levels of repeatability: pit diameter was more repeatable than response time to prey, followed by prey exploitation efficiency. Behavioral repeatability of the same trait differed according to context, suggesting that repeatability is a trait in itself and should not be considered identical even when studying the same behavioral trait.","10.1007/s00442-015-3284-8","0029-8549","1432-1939","ISI:000358089400010",NA,NA,NA,NA,320,249,474,"#000000",NA,""

With organisms being increasingly exposed to rapid environmental changes, there is growing interest in understanding individual phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in predation pressure. Behavioural and physiological responses to predator exposure are of particular interest as differences in predation pressure are often reflected in correlated suites of behavioural and hormonal profiles across populations. Within populations, the association between endocrine profiles and behaviour is less understood and often lacking. Adopting a reaction norm approach and a repeated measures design, we assessed within-population effects of changes in perceived predation risk on endocrinology and behaviour in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly exposed subjects to a robotic model predator and assessed their behavioural response. The fish showed consistent behavioural profiles and were less active and shyer when predation risk was higher. Using non-invasive waterborne hormone analysis, we assessed basal cortisol as well as the cortisol response to changes in predation risk. Individuals showed significantly higher cortisol levels following exposure to the model predator. Individual post-predator exposure cortisol was repeatable but unrelated to behavioural responses. Accounting for between versus within-subject effects, we found that basal cortisol and shyness were positively related within individuals, that is individuals overall were shyer on days they had higher cortisol levels. We also tested if basal testosterone predicted risky behaviour and found no evidence for this hypothesis. No individual differences in hormonal or behavioural responses to changes in predation risk were found, suggesting that individuals are not constrained by their personalities in their ability to cope with a potentially harmful threat. Overall, we show that individuals of different personalities are equally flexible' in their response to changes in predation pressure. Our study offers novel insight into consistent individual differences and plasticity in hormones and behaviour as well as their interplay within populations. Future studies should assess the applicability of these findings to other changes in the environment, as well as the effects of social context on endocrine and behavioural reaction norms.","10.1111/1365-2435.12400","0269-8463","1365-2435","ISI:000357738300008",NA,"Furtbauer, Ines/0000-0003-1404-6280",NA,NA,321,433,280,"#000000",NA,""

Although sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post- exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23\% lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial alteration of personality differences even in absence of a population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations, exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on non-targeted fauna.","10.1111/1365-2435.12413","0269-8463","1365-2435","ISI:000357738300011",NA,"Royaute, Raphael/0000-0002-5837-633X Buddle, Christopher/0000-0002-7494-9732",NA,NA,322,634,287,"#000000",NA,""

The behavioural phenotype of a conspecific is likely to affect the outcome of a social interaction, so an individual must be able to accurately assess behavioural phenotypes in order to optimize behavioural responses during mate choice, cooperative relationships and agonistic interactions. However, behavioural assessment based on dyadic interactions in different contexts can be costly because it may require significant time, increase the risk of predation and often necessitates special cognitive abilities. Different colour cues are associated with different life history strategies in many species, so coloration might also correlate with behavioural phenotype. Thus, conspecifics could use coloration as a single cue for the mediation of social interactions. We investigated the relationship between personality and coloration in the monogamous, biparental convict cichlid. This species has black melanin-based stripes with interindividual variation in the intensity of these stripes. In addition, females have bright orange spots on their abdomens. Using repeatable measures of boldness, exploration and aggressiveness, we were able to define a behavioural syndrome and quantified the behavioural type of each individual. Behavioural types were predicted by colour traits. In particular, proactive individuals (more aggressive, bolder and quicker to resume behaviour after being startled) were more likely to be dark and, among females, have smaller orange areas. Our results support the hypothesis that coloration in the convict cichlid is related to personality. Thus, coloration could play an important role in mediating social interactions, allowing a quick and reliable assessment of conspecifics' behavioural types.

Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability). However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power. Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability, and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies. Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time (if present).

Similarly, the effects of age of dam and age of lamb were significant for almost all variables. The estimates of heritability and repeatability for the behavioral variables ranged from low to moderate magnitudes, with high standard errors, for VOC: 0.19 +/- 0.17 and 0.15 +/- 0.05, MOV: 0.21 +/- 0.07 and 0.065 +/- 0.02, TEN: 0.27 +/- 0.19 and 0.16 +/- 0.13, EB: 0.16 +/- 0.12 and 0.13 +/- 0.03, EP: 0.23 +/- 0.19 and 0.21 +/- 0.15, GS: 0.22 +/- 0.16 and 0.13 +/- 0.11 and FS: 0.165 +/- 0.13 and 0.11 +/- 0.06, respectively, indicating low possibility of direct selection and lowly repeatable behavioral responses over time. Discussion: The results showed the significant influence of type of management on the majority of variables, fact that may be explained by different management systems to which the animals were subjected, in addition to the weaning effect. The absence of significant effect of sex on reactivity variables contradicts previous findings, in which males were found to be less reactive than females. Regarding the genetic parameters, few estimates of heritability for reactivity traits have been reported for sheep, mainly assessed in the arena test. Such results differ from those obtained in the present study which were lowly and moderately heritable, but with high standard errors, probably due to the small number of animals and the structure of the relationship matrix. The coefficients of repeatability for the evaluated traits during and after weighing were also low, thus measurements in the first evaluations were relatively poor predictors of the same behavioral responses on subsequent situations. Although a relatively small number of animals were used in the present study, it was possible to estimate genetic parameters for reactivity traits assessed during and after weighing. Thus, it is necessary to invest in selection, as reactivity has important influence on ease of handling and animal welfare.",NA,"1678-0345","1679-9216","ISI:000358619800004","1289",NA,NA,NA,325,211,658,"#000000",NA,""

We examined this rarely tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity. We focused on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies: shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly context-specific.

Only recently have studies of individual variation in dispersal behavior become a focus of research. A better understanding of individual variation in dispersal behavior is likely to improve our understanding of population dynamics. In particular, the dynamics of critically small populations (endangered species) and large populations (pest species) may be driven by unique dispersal variants. Here we documented individual variation in the ballooning dispersal behavior of Western black widow spiderlings Latrodectus hesperus, an urban pest species found in superabundant infestations throughout cities of the desert Southwest USA. We found a great deal of family-level variation in ballooning dispersal, and this variation was highly consistent (repeatable) across time. Maternal egg investment was a poor predictor of this ballooning dispersal. Instead, we show that spiderlings reared in isolation are significantly slower to disperse than spiderlings raised in a more natural setting surrounded by full siblings. Thus, our study examines a widespread but poorly understood dispersal behavior (ballooning), and suggests urban pest population dynamics are likely driven by the interaction of variation in individuals, families and social environments.","10.1093/czoolo/61.3.520","1674-5507",NA,"ISI:000356968400014",NA,NA,NA,NA,327,307,328,"#000000",NA,""

Although widely described as ``reliable and valid{''} in research reports, several recent field studies have suggested that PCL-R scores provided by examiners in forensic cases are significantly less reliable than the interrater reliability values reported in research studies. Most of these field studies, however, have had small samples and only examined SVP civil commitment cases. This study builds on existing research by examining the reliability of PCL-R scores provided by forensic examiners in a much more extensive sample of Canadian criminal cases. Using the LexisNexis database, we identified 102 cases in which at least 2 scores were reported (of 257 total PCL-R scores). The single-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICCA1) was .59, indicating that a large percentage of the variance in individual scores was attributable to some form of error. ICC values were somewhat higher for sexual offending cases (. 66) than they were for nonsexual offending cases (.46), indicating that poor interrater reliability was not restricted specifically to the assessment of sexual offenders. These and earlier findings concerning field reliability in legal cases suggest that the standard error of measurement for PCL-R scores that are provided to the courts is likely to be much larger than the value of 2.90 reported in the instrument's manual.","10.1037/pas0000048","1040-3590","1939-134X","ISI:000355939000009",NA,"Edens, John/0000-0002-2218-0650",NA,NA,328,275,133,"#000000",NA,""

Male threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) experienced three different contexts (single female, single male, paired female-male) over the course of 8 days, with an experimental group of males receiving EE2 after the first day. Exposure to EE2 disrupted responsiveness, behavioral consistency, and behavioral variation in all three social contexts.

An understanding of this inter-individual variation is essential to improve our knowledge of the adaptive value of behaviour. Coping styles may have implications in diverse fields, so the development of appropriate screening methods for each species appears to be the most effective way to extend our knowledge and to incorporate behavioural responses into selection-based breeding programmes, to improve the domestication and welfare of farmed fish. We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation, aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact. By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and long-term). These tests therefore appeared to be the most relevant for the characterisation of coping style in European seabass. Furthermore, the results of these tests were also predictive of cortisol stress response. These tests are simple to perform and can be used to screen large numbers of fish, the first step in selection programmes including behavioural profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In crustaceans, HD is directly proportional to protein concentrations, and thus indicative of physiological condition. HD was highly repeatable, and crabs showed consistent individual differences in their behavioural responses to a novel environment, thus indicating individual consistency in both physiology and behaviour. Furthermore, HD was significantly correlated with the crabs' risk propensity, i. e. individuals with higher HD spent more time near shelter. Overall, this provides the first evidence for consistency in an endogenous physiological trait in an invertebrate.

Over a 33-day period, subjects were scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r = 0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be related to either of two measures of public information use.

Here, we report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow, flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed. Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance.

Here we attempted to measure five key behavioural traits (aggression, boldness, exploration, activity and sociability) in a native Australian social skink, Egernia whitii. Specifically, we documented the temporal consistency of trait structural definition, the temporal consistency of trait expression and the relationships between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We found (1) that the structural consistency of some traits (boldness), but not others (aggressiveness and exploration), changed across time and according to sex (i.e. the relationship between the raw behaviours that were measured in the boldness assay was different for males and females); (2) that three of the five behavioural traits exhibited moderate-to-high adjusted repeatability while two were not repeatable; (3) covariances between behavioural traits were weak to non-existent and did not support the presence of any behavioural syndromes. These results indicate that structural consistency of traits or the behavioural definition' of an aggregate score is potentially variable over time. This may limit inference on any subsequent estimates of repeatability of behavioural traits, as well as estimates of potential syndromes. Repeatability of behavioural traits may reflect underlying ecological importance, or measurement processes, and lack of behavioural syndromes may reflect lack of selection pressure for trait covariance. Studies examining multiple behavioural traits under a measurement as well as an ecological framework are crucial to make meaningful inferences regarding the ecological and evolutionary significance of behavioural traits.","10.1111/jzo.12217","0952-8369","1469-7998","ISI:000354034900008",NA,"McEvoy, Jo/0000-0001-9591-1824 Carver, Scott/0000-0002-3579-7588 While, Geoffrey/0000-0001-8122-9322 Wapstra, Erik/0000-0002-2050-8026","McEvoy, Jo/M-7204-2015 Carver, Scott/J-7654-2014 While, Geoffrey/O-6306-2017 Wapstra, Erik/J-7482-2014",NA,341,81,320,"#000000",NA,""

Nevertheless, the repeatability of foraging behaviour remains poorly understood. In particular, whether individuals differ in their respective degrees of repeatability still remains to be determined. Here, we estimated foraging behaviour repeatability in the great cormorant, at both the population and the individual levels, and assessed the effect of repeatability on individual foraging performance. At the population level, we found that some foraging variables were more repeatable (e.g. departure angle and trip duration) than others (e.g. time spent underwater per trip). At the individual level, we found differences in the degree of repeatability for each foraging variable, highlighting the presence of both highly flexible and highly consistent individuals in the population. The effect of repeatability on individual performance depended on the considered timescale: individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per dive was negatively related to foraging efficiency while individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per trip was positively related to foraging efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of studying repeatability at the individual level and shows how both flexibility and consistency in animal behaviour shape their ability to extract energy from the environment.

Similarly, it is poorly understood how consistent individual differences in decision making are influenced by their social context. Here we investigated whether zebrafish, Danio rerio, show individual consistency ('personality') in speedeaccuracy trade-offs based on a colour discrimination task, and how pairs of fish with distinct personalities make consensus choices. The results showed that zebrafish exhibit between-individual speedeaccuracy trade-offs: some fish made `careful', slow but accurate decisions, while others made swift but less accurate choices. We also found that these decision-making strategies were constant over time: fish retained the same strategy for 3 days. When testing pairs of careful and fast-and-inaccurate individuals, the combined choice strategy was intermediate in speed, but statistically indistinguishable from the careful individual, whereas accuracy of the dyad decision was moderately higher than that of each individual when tested singly, although this was again not significantly different from the more careful individual. For the first time, our study thus demonstrates that two individuals influence one another's speedeaccuracy tradeoff in decision making. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Different combinations of personality traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in physiology. For example, fast' (bold, active, fast exploring) individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than slow' animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative stress. Thus, the extended pace of life theory' predicts that fast' individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than slow' ones. Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in slow' individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage vs. after 15min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex.","10.1111/1365-2435.12375","0269-8463","1365-2435","ISI:000353684800010",NA,"Arnold, Kathryn/0000-0002-6485-6065","Arnold, Kathryn/F-8683-2016",NA,344,311,191,"#000000",NA,""

The original theory suggested that temperament traits were under genetic influences, whereas character traits were gradually built by an interaction between temperaments and environment until early adulthood. This study attempted to evaluate TCI by examining the genetic and environmental contributions to personality with particular attention to spousal effects. From 687 families, a total of 3459 Korean adult individuals completed the survey. Among them, there were 542 Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 122 Dizygotic twin pairs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and heritability were calculated to examine the genetic and shared environmental contributions to personality. Moderate genetic contributions (0.17-0.43) were found for all TCI traits along with the evidence of shared environment (0.11-031) for harm avoidance (HA) and all characters. The ICCs of TCI in MZ pairs ranged 0.36-0.46. Spouses' had little resemblance for temperament, whereas for character dimensions, spouses (0.27-0.38) were more similar than first degree relatives (0.10-0.29). Resemblance between spouses increased with duration of marriage for most characters and HA. When the growing similarities between spouses were compared with their MZ cotwins' for subgroup of 81 trios, self-directedness (SD) of character showed even more similarities toward their spouses than cotwins as partnership duration increased (r = 0.32). Our findings with regard to change in SD into late adulthood support the psychobiological theory of temperament and character, which suggests that both personality domains have distinct developmental trajectories despite equally large genetic influences.

The methodologies included an inclined mirror assay, two flat mirror assays with different acclimation periods, a live conspecific assay, a clay model stimulus assay, and a video recording assay. Our results indicate high repeatability in most aggressive behaviors over time, which confirms the value of each assay to measure personality. However, our results also indicate significant differences between the assays. Specifically, assays using a flat mirror or live conspecific as a stimulus for aggression elicited more attempted bites than an inclined mirror, a clay model stimulus, or a video recording stimulus. Furthermore, the inclined mirror stimulus provoked more darts than any other assay.

In this study, we investigated individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior: repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable, cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range, movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast, behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from ``resident{''} individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity, and minimal movement to ``mobile{''} individuals with large home ranges, high movement rates, and little site fidelity.

The ERT included a series of subtasks that expose each dog sequentially to visual, auditory, and experiential stimuli with an associated grading scale used by trained observers to rate individual dog responses. In this study, 16 Labrador retrievers that met initial selection criteria as candidate IDDs were assessed using the ERT, measurement of plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations (pre-and post-ERT), and an independent open-field test of anxiety in response to sound stimuli. Based on the sum of its responses, each dog was assigned an aggregate ERT score. Aggregate ERT scores from independent trained observers were highly concordant {[} Shrout-Fleiss's intraclass correlation (2,1) = 0.96] suggesting excellent inter-rater reliability. The aggregate ERT scores were also negatively correlated with the dogs' scores on the open-field anxiety test (Spearman rank correlation, n = 16, r = -0.57, P = 0.0214). In addition, there were significant increases in salivary (Wilcoxon signed rank, n = 16, S = 38.5, P 0.0458) and plasma (Wilcoxon signed rank, n = 16, S = 68, P < 0.0001) cortisol levels after the ERT, compared with baseline, suggesting that exposure to the ERT test elements produced a physiological stress response. We conclude that the ERT is a useful pre-training screening test that can be used to identify dogs with a low threshold of emotional reactivity for rejection, and dogs with a high threshold of emotional reactivity for entry into the IDD training program.

Although courtship display is generally consistent in terms of behavioural sequence and structure, there is also commonly important variation in the intensity of courtship display between and within males of a given species. Indeed, not all males have the same ability to perform courtship display (variation between males), and each male can potentially adjust his courtship effort in response to the environment (variation within a male). Although the study of male courtship display has received considerable attention in recent years, it is still unclear which part of the variation can be explained by male ability or motivation. We investigated this issue on two phases of the complex courtship display of the palmate newt Lissotriton helveticus. Overall, we found that both male and female identities affected courtship behaviour, but the relative influence of each sex depended on the courtship phase. Male identity explained variation in fan and creep-quiver display, whereas female identity explained variation in creep-quiver only. Interestingly, we did not find any link between the expression of courtship display and male or female morphological traits.

In territorial species, individuals often have to balance signalling towards unfamiliar potential competitors (to solely broadcast territory ownership) with signalling towards familiar immediate neighbours (to also maintain so-called ``dear enemy{'' relations). Hence, to understand how signals evolve due to these multilevel relationships, it is important to understand how general signal traits vary in relation to the overall social environment. For many territorial songbirds dawn is a key signalling period, with several neighbouring individuals singing simultaneously without immediate conflict. In this study we tested whether sharing a territory boundary, rather than spatial proximity, is related to similarity in dawn song traits between territorial great tits (Parus major) in a wild personality-typed population. We collected a large dataset of automatized dawn song recordings from 72 unique male great tits, during the fertile period of their mate, and compared specific song traits between neighbours and non-neighbours. We show here that both song rate and start time of dawn song were repeatable song traits. Moreover, neighbours were significantly more dissimilar in song rate compared to non-neighbours, while there was no effect of proximity on song rate similarity. Additionally, similarity in start time of dawn song was unrelated to sharing a territory boundary, but birds were significantly more similar in start time of dawn song when they were breeding in close proximity of each other. We suggest that the dissimilarity in dawn song rate between neighbours is either the result of neighbouring great tits actively avoiding similar song rates to possibly prevent interference, or a passive consequence of territory settlement preferences relative to the types of neighbours. Neighbourhood structuring is therefore likely to be a relevant selection pressure shaping variation in territorial birdsong.","10.1371/journal.pone.0116881","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000350061500029","e0116881","Library, Library/0000-0002-3835-159X van Oers, Kees/0000-0001-6984-906X Snijders, Lysanne/0000-0003-0911-3418","Library, Library/A-4320-2012 Naguib, Marc/C-2650-2009 ",NA,353,545,575,"#000000",NA,""

If such a model is valid, then stress response traits should be repeatable and physiological and behavioral responses should also change in an integrated manner along a major axis of among-individual variation. While there is some evidence of association between endocrine and behavioral stress response traits, few studies incorporate repeated observations of both. To test this model, we use a multivariate, repeated measures approach in a captive-bred population of Xiphophorus birchmanni. We quantify among-individual variation in behavioral stress response to an open field trial (OFT) with simulated predator attack (SPA) and measure waterborne steroid hormone levels (cortisol, 11-ketotestosterone) before and after exposure. Under the mild stress stimulus (OFT), (multivariate) behavioral variation among individuals was consistent with a strong axis of personality (shy-bold) or coping style (reactive-proactive) variation. However, behavioral responses to a moderate stressor (SPA) were less repeatable, and robust statistical support for repeatable endocrine state over the full sampling period was limited to 11-ketotestosterone. Although post hoc analysis suggested cortisol expression was repeatable over short time periods, qualitative relationships between behavior and glucocorticoid levels were counter to our a priori expectations. Thus, while our results clearly show among-individual differences in behavioral and endocrine traits associated with stress response, the correlation structure between these is not consistent with a simple proactive-reactive axis of integrated stress-coping style. Additionally, the low repeatability of cortisol suggests caution is warranted if single observations (or indeed repeat measures over short sampling periods) of glucocorticoid traits are used in ecological or evolutionary studies focussed at the individual level.","10.1002/ece3.1395","2045-7758",NA,"ISI:000349386000009",NA,"Canario, Adelino/0000-0002-6244-6468 Boulton, Kay/0000-0001-7830-5793 Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051","Canario, Adelino/C-7942-2009 Algarve, CCMAR/C-2603-2018 ",NA,354,278,528,"#000000",NA,""

Horse facilities were selected on the basis of reports of inspections on animal welfare conducted by competent local authorities; they were classified as ``excellent{'' (N=5) and ``sub-optimal{''} (N=6). Four observers, with no experience in assessing equine welfare and not aware of the a pribri category of the facility, were trained to perform and score standardised human-equine behavioural tests: avoidance distance test (AD), voluntary animal approach test (VAA), forced human approach test (FHA), walking down side and tail tuck. All the behavioural tests carried out proved to be feasible in an on-farm environment. In spite of the fact that the reactions of horses were largely positive, those kept in facilities with ``sub-optimal{''} relationship showed avoidance and aggressive behaviours more often when approached (GLMM P<0.05). As for donkeys, less than 30\% of the animals exhibited negative behaviour towards the assessor. Observer's agreement of AD, VAA, FHA, WDS and tail tuck scoring was consistent for both species (percentage agreement ranged between 67.7\% and 93.3\%). Repeatability of tests was good for all the tests and no significant differences were found between two repetitions at 3-month intervals. Our results support the findings described for working donkeys and show that, also on-farm, the assessment of donkeys' reactions to an unknown human during standardised tests could prove useful in evaluating the quality of their relationship with humans. Further research is needed to verify if our findings can be generalised for different husbandry conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The evolutionary costs and benefits of certain personality traits are frequently assumed to fluctuate across different life history stages. However, little is still known about survival consequences of personality during juvenile life. We predicted survival costs of exploration tendency in juvenile European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which we studied under quasi-natural conditions. In addition, consistencies between exploration and the animal's behavioral responses in other contexts were tested. Early exploratory behavior was assessed in two annual cohorts, either observationally by quantifying the time course of exploring the area around the nursery burrow shortly after emergence above ground or experimentally by conducting open-field tests shortly before emergence. In both years, the study revealed consistent results: more exploratory individuals had a lower chance of survival until the end of the vegetation period, presumably due to a higher predation risk. Fast explorers, as assessed by their exploration of the burrow environment, were also less sociable and tended to be more aggressive toward conspecifics as subadults. Sociability was repeatable across time. Furthermore, fast explorers, as assessed by their open-field behavior, were bolder in a handling test before emergence. These consistencies across context and time suggest the existence of personality. In conclusion, the results provide evidence for survival costs of fast exploration during juvenile life. The findings are in line with predictions on personality-related life history variation.","10.1007/s00265-014-1833-5","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000347818500004",NA,"Rodel, Heiko/0000-0003-0228-2884",NA,NA,356,560,357,"#000000",NA,""

One possible explanation for consistent individual differences in parenting is that individuals invest in different aspects of parental care, such as provisioning or defense. In this field study, we measured consistent individual differences in parenting behavior and evaluated correlations between parenting and other behaviors in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly measured male parenting behavior and male behavior in the presence of three different types of live intruders: a female, a conspecific male, and a predator, meant to provoke courtship, aggressive, and antipredator behavior, respectively. While males plastically adjusted their reactions to different types of intruders, we found consistent individual differences in behavior (behavioral types) both within and across contexts, even after accounting for variation in body size and nest characteristics. Males that performed more parenting behavior responded faster to all types of intruders. These results suggest that in nature, individual male sticklebacks exhibit robust parental behavioral types, and highly parental males are more attentive to their surroundings. Future studies are needed to examine the potential causes of individual variation in parental behavior in the field.","10.1007/s00265-014-1835-3","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000347818500006",NA,NA,NA,NA,357,140,334,"#000000",NA,""

Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) are the two main rs-fcMRI approaches to assess alterations in brain networks associated with individual differences, behavior and psychopathology. While the BOLD signal is stronger with a higher temporal resolution, ASL provides quantitative, direct measures of the physiology and metabolism of specific networks. This study systematically investigated the similarity and reliability of resting brain networks (RBNs) in BOLD and ASL. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was employed where each subject underwent repeated BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI scans on two occasions on two MRI scanners respectively. Both independent and joint FC analyses revealed common RBNs in ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI with a moderate to high level of spatial overlap, verified by Dice Similarity Coefficients. Test-retest analyses indicated more reliable spatial network patterns in BOLD (average modal Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 0.905 +/- 0.033 between-sessions; 0.885 +/- 0.052 between-scanners) than ASL (0.545 +/- 0.048; 0.575 +/- 0.059). Nevertheless, ASL provided highly reproducible (0.955 +/- 0.021; 0.970 +/- 0.011) network-specific CBF measurements. Moreover, we observed positive correlations between regional CBF and FC in core areas of all RBNs indicating a relationship between network connectivity and its baseline metabolism. Taken together, the combination of ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI provides a powerful tool for characterizing the spatiotemporal and quantitative properties of RBNs. These findings pave the way for future BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI studies in clinical populations that are carried out across time and scanners. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52\% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified.","10.1098/rspb.2014.2201","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000344595000011","20142201",NA,"Dochtermann, Ned/A-7146-2010",NA,360,597,546,"#000000",NA,""

Risk is likely perceived differently by individuals in relation to among-individual differences in correlated behavioral traits, that is, syndromes or personalities. Given that animals can avoid the risk of predation/disturbance through modification of their habitat use, we might expect individuals of differing behavioral types to adopt contrasting tactics of habitat use when faced with risky or stressful situations. We studied the relationship between habitat use and among-individual variation in behavioral profile in a population of roe deer. We hypothesized that an individual's habitat use tactics should be related to their capacity to cope with risky situations. In particular, we predicted that more reactive (risk-averse) roe deer, with relatively high behavioral response and high body temperature at capture, long flight distances and which were more vigilant during feeding, should use riskier open habitat less, particularly when risk is high. We found that although the use of open habitat during the day was negatively correlated with the indices of reactivity at capture, it was also positively correlated with indices of reactivity while foraging in open habitat. Furthermore, most of the behavioral parameters we measured were intercorrelated and moderately repeatable, potentially indexing personality traits. We conclude that there is substantial interindividual variability in how individuals manage risky situations which imposes constraints on how they are able to exploit high-risk habitats, suggesting the existence of a risk management syndrome in this large herbivore.","10.1093/beheco/aru169","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000351929300016",NA,"Cote, Julien/0000-0002-4453-5969","Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011",NA,361,330,56,"#000000",NA,""

Typically these behavioural types are composed of bold, aggressive, dominant individuals and shy, less aggressive, subordinate individuals. Mountain chickadees living in varying climatic conditions across a montane environment appear to exhibit consistent behavioural types, such that high elevation birds, which experience harsher winter conditions and rely more heavily on spatial memory to retrieve food caches to survive winter, explore a novel environment at a slower rate (i.e., shy) and are socially subordinate to low elevation birds. Dominance is typically expressed in individual pairwise interactions, but it is not always clear which traits predispose an individual to become a dominant in such interactions. Aggression is frequently suggested to be associated with higher dominance status, yet the data are equivocal. Here we aimed to test whether previously described elevation related differences in social dominance might be associated with elevation related differences in aggression levels in mountain chickadees by using the mirror test. The mirror test can address potential differences in reactive and proactive aggression, although caution should be taken when using the mirror test as some species are able to self-recognize. Low elevation birds responded more aggressively to their mirror image than high elevation birds, suggesting that elevation related differences in aggression may be partially responsible for previously found differences in social dominance status.","10.1163/1568539X-00003248","0005-7959","1568-539X","ISI:000351364600006",NA,NA,NA,NA,362,204,321,"#000000",NA,""

In the present study we investigated whether these behavioural traits were consistent at both the nychtemeral scale (24 h) and over a long time period (7 months). In addition, we investigated if aggressiveness and activity were positively correlated. Both activity and aggressiveness were significantly repeatable, indicating that both behavioural traits could be considered as personality traits. Interestingly, nocturnal activity was correlated to diurnal activity, indicating that this personality trait was highly stable at the circadian scale.

Each individual was sampled two to five times and samples were collected one or more years apart during the pre-breeding season (Jan-March). In addition, individuals sampled over the greatest time period (6-8 years) were analyzed separately to more closely assess long-term repeatability. SI-CORT was repeatable in females, but not males, when values were not corrected for confounding variables (agreement repeatability). However, when the year and time of day of sample collection were controlled (adjusted repeatability), SI-CORT was repeatable in both sexes. SI-CORT was also repeatable in the males and females sampled 6-8 years apart. Finally, baseline CORT levels of males, but not females, exhibited low but significant repeatability when adjusted for year. The results of this study demonstrate that differences in SI-CORT levels were repeatable within adult scrub-jays sampled up to 8 years apart. Further, the female SI-CORT response was more consistent between pre-breeding seasons than males, which may have resulted from males having higher SI-CORT plasticity in response to environmental conditions. These data support the hypothesis that the SI-CORT response of Florida scrub-jays develops before adulthood and persists throughout much, if not all, of their natural adult life span.","10.1007/s00360-014-0866-4","0174-1578","1432-136X","ISI:000347249200011",NA,NA,NA,NA,364,527,596,"#000000",NA,""

In Experiment 1, Angus and Angus-cross beef cows (n = 1546) from eight locations were assigned a body condition score (BCS; 1 = emaciated; 9 = obese) and chute exit and gait score (1 = slow exit, walk; calm temperament; 2 = jump, trot or run; excitable temperament).

Although recent work has provided insights into the demographic factors that influence inter-colony variation in collective behavior (i.e., colony-level personality or collective personality), relatively few studies have investigated how the physical environment (e.g., habitat structure) affects colony-level personality. Here, we study the emergence of collective personality in prey capture behavior in the social spider, Stegodyphus dumicola. We measured collective prey capture behavior four times over 36 days in a classic repeated measures design. We used four different artificial habitat (web support) structures in three different treatments: habitat structure was either (1) fixed and undisturbed, (2) disturbed with a complete removal of webbing between each measurement, or (3) disturbed with changes of habitat structure between each measurement. Our results revealed that repeatability in colony-level personality was retained as long as habitat structure was not altered. However, the repeatability of colony-level personality declined precipitously when groups were forced to build their webs on novel habitat structures. Furthermore, habitat structure affected collective capture behavior, that is, latency to attack and the number of attackers differed among colonies on different habitat structures. Collectively, our data demonstrate that habitat structure is instrumental in shaping both the mean and repeatability of the collective behavior of colonies and may influence overall foraging success.","10.1007/s00265-014-1802-z","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000344772100006",NA,"Forrester, Nicole/0000-0002-5210-8801 Modlmeier, Andreas/0000-0002-3095-488X",NA,NA,371,260,4,"#993f3f","excluded","group personality"

However, while the foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality. Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities.","10.1007/s00265-014-1804-x","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000344772100008",NA,NA,NA,NA,372,61,301,"#000000",NA,""

Yet, repeatability can be influenced by the interactive social strategies of individuals, for example, consistent inter-individual variation in aggression is well documented. Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level remains unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of consistent and repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species of shark, a taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet to be described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten independent shark groups across different habitats, testing repeatability in individual network position under changing environments. To understand better the mechanisms behind repeatable social behaviour, we also explored the coupling between individual preferences for specific group sizes and social network position. We quantify repeatability in sharks by demonstrating that despite changes in aggregation measured at the group level, the social network position of individuals is consistent across treatments. Group size preferences were found to influence the social network position of individuals in small groups but less so for larger groups suggesting network structure, and thus, repeatability was driven by social preference over aggregation tendency.","10.1007/s00265-014-1805-9","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000344772100009",NA,"Croft, Darren/0000-0001-6869-5097","Croft, Darren/B-5503-2009",NA,373,532,70,"#000000",NA,""

Behavioral syndromes, on the other hand, appear as consistent individual variation in behavior that is both repeatable for individuals within a functional context (e.g., consistent voracity toward prey) and correlated across contexts (e.g., high voracity toward prey and high levels of boldness toward enemies). Thus, adaptive plasticity and syndromes represent two extremes of a behavioral plasticity continuum upon which most behavioral phenotypes fall. We tested for both adaptive plasticity and behavioral syndromes in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. We measured behavior in three contexts: startle, startle+prey, and startle+mate, and found (1) classic behaviorally plastic responses to predation risk, (2) high repeatability of behavior within contexts, and (3) evidence of a correlation between startle+prey and startle+mate contexts, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. As relative behavioral plasticity may vary across populations, we also compared urban and desert populations to test whether spiders from these habitats exhibit different behaviors and/or behavioral syndromes. While we found that urban males used in mating trials courted urban females significantly more than desert females, we found no other differences in the behavior of urban and desert black widows. Thus, black widows, regardless of habitat, are characterized by both context-specific behavioral plasticity and across-context correlations, presenting a phenotypic complexity that is likely exhibited, to varying degrees, by most organisms.","10.1111/eth.12297","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000344348600010",NA,NA,NA,NA,374,2,322,"#000000",NA,""

The boom in the literature on behavioural variability has led to the emergence of concepts such as behavioural plasticity, stereotypy, imprecision, and intra-individual variability (IIV). The proliferation of new terms has resulted in overlapping concepts, spreading confusion in understanding the origins of variability. Here we provide a critical overview of the concepts related to behavioural variability within the individual. We conclude that although there is no overlapping between behavioural plasticity and IIV, these concepts do overlap with stereotypy; they also face problems with ideas of abnormality and absence of function in stereotyped behaviour. We further provide a critical overview of the sometimes confusing relationship between (1) within individual variability, and (2) consistent variability across individuals (personality). We point out that personality is logically independent of both activational plasticity and IIV, because personality emerges at the population level, whereas plasticity and IIV emerge at the individual level. We conclude that, in personality studies, the failure to acknowledge the existence of either internal variability or consistent between-individual differences in internal variability will result in mixing different phenomena, and inhibit building unified accounts from heterogeneous databases.

Horses, as other group-living polygynous mammals, form stable linear dominance hierarchies based on agonistic interactions. Higher dominance positions are believed to be connected, in both sexes, to better condition and higher reproductive success. Many variables play a role in forming the dominant-submissive relationships between horses; however, the maternal effect on the dominance position of the offspring still remains unclear, as do the possible mechanisms of transference ({''}inheritance{''}). We hypothesized that the maternal dominance position, plus differences in suckling parameters or maternal style, may be responsible for later outcome of the offspring's dominance position, characterized by 2 variables: index of fighting success (CB); and rate of winning encounters (RW). Our study animals were 8 groups of Kladruby horses, loose-housed lactating mares with foals (n = 66 mare-foal pairs); and subsequently 4 groups of the same foals at 3 yr of age. Our results revealed the impact of age on the dominance position of the young horses (P < 0.001 for CB, and P < 0.01 for RW), and residence in the group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, respectively); not the maternal dominance position. Older foals reached higher dominance positions, independent of the dominance position, age, or experience of the mother; therefore, we did not find support for direct inheritance of maternal rank. Nevertheless, the foals born to the same mare in 2 consecutive seasons (n = 16 mares) revealed fair repeatability in the dominance position they obtained at 3 yr of age (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.46). This suggests an important constant effect of the mother on the social success of her progeny; however, we did not find a significant effect of any of the tested variables describing maternal characteristics or maternal care. Dominance position depended significantly on the foal's age at observation, and the residence in the herd formed via sequential introducing of later-weaned groups of foals. The most dominant horses were mainly recruited from the first-weaned group of the season, and thus were also the oldest individuals in the herd. Further research is needed to discover the role of foal personality and mare style, and their links to possible dominance behaviors in a herd.","10.2527/jas2014-7674","0021-8812","1525-3163","ISI:000344622600048",NA,"Komarkova, Martina /0000-0003-4645-3083",NA,NA,377,30,168,"#000000",NA,""

The model predicts relationships between the means and the variability of the behavior expressed by neonates and the subsequent developmental trajectories of their behavior when every individual is reared under the same environmental conditions. Several predictions of the model are supported by data from previous studies of behavioral development, for example, that the temporal stability of personality will increase with age and that the intercepts and slopes of developmental trajectories for boldness will be negatively correlated across individuals or genotypes when subjects are raised in safe environments.

Recent studies failed to provide strong support for these predictions, especially outside of strictly controlled conditions, and long-term measures to test the first prediction are rare. Here, we demonstrate individual repeatability across 2-3 years of maximum circulating corticosterone concentration {[}CORT] and area under the [}CORT] response curve (AUC(I)) during a standard capture-restraint test in wild, free-living adult Nazca boobies (Sula granti). We also show that the stress response predicts the personality traits aggression and anxiety in these birds (measured in the wild); however, the strength of these results was weak. Maximum {[}CORT] and AUC(I) showed higher repeatability between years than baseline {[}CORT]. After controlling breeding status, sex, mass, date sampled, and their interactions, baseline {[}CORT] was most closely related to personality traits, followed by AUC(I), and then maximum {[}CORT]. The direction of these relationships depended on whether the testing context was social or non-social. {[}CORT] parameters had little to no relationship with cross-context plasticity in personality traits.

Such adaptations include activity rhythms, orientation, zonation, burrowing, escape responses and feeding strategies, the first two being common adaptations to all mobile animals. The complex conditions of a particular beach environment may be integrated in a learning process enhancing the adaptation and survival of individuals and eventually of populations. Evidence exists of genetic determination of some behavioural features that are adaptive in the long term (throughout generations) by increasing individual survival and reproductive potential. The environmental features integrated with the life history of beach animals shape the individual behaviour through ontogenetic processes, as well as population behaviour through evolutionary processes. Thus, behavioural differences among individuals may reflect environmental variation at the local and small/medium temporal scales of beach processes, whereas within-population behavioural coherence and differences among populations may reflect variation at the geographic scale. The different foci stressed by different authors and the variety of evidence dependent upon local geographical and ecological conditions have often resulted in compartmentalised explanations, making generalizations and the repeatability of behavioural studies of beach ecology challenging. There was a need to developing a more synthetic paradigm for beach animal behaviour.

Much research has been conducted to test whether such adoption of a ``faster{''} life-history strategy is accompanied by concordant changes in behavior and physiology, with mixed results. As research in this field has focused on comparison of mean-level responses of treatment groups, few studies include repeated measures of response variables and the effect that developmental stress may have on repeatability per se. We investigated how early-developmental stress affects the mean expression of (and repeatability in) a variety of behavioral and physiological traits in female zebra finches. We predicted that: (1) individuals subjected to nutritional restriction in the nestling phase would have higher feeding and activity rates, with associated increases in hematocrit and basal metabolic rates (BMRs), (2) nutritional restriction in early life would alter adults' stress-induced corticosterone level, and (3) developmental stress would, respectively, influence the amount of among-individual and within-individual variation in behavioral and physiological traits, hence affecting the repeatability of these traits. In comparison to control females, stressed females did not differ in activity rate or stress-induced corticosterone level, but they did have higher levels of feeding, hematocrit, and BMR. Among-individual variance and repeatability were generally higher in stressed females than in controls. Finally, we found that developmental dietary restriction significantly reduced the amount of within-individual variance both in activity rate in the novel environment and in stress-induced corticosterone level. Our results not only confirm previous findings on the effect of early-developmental stress on BMR, but also extend its effect to feeding rate and hematocrit, suggesting that developmental plasticity in these traits is ontogenetically linked. Early-developmental stress may disable particular genetic canalizing processes, which would release cryptic genetic variation and explain why repeatability and among-individual variance were generally higher in the stressed groups than in controls. For activity rate in the novel environment and with stress-induced corticosterone level, however, early-developmental stress significantly reduced within-individual variance, which may be a consequence of increased canalization of these traits at the micro-environmental level.","10.1093/icb/icu095","1540-7063","1557-7023","ISI:000343314700002",NA,"Buchanan, Katherine/0000-0002-6648-5819 Careau, Vincent/0000-0002-2826-7837 Buttemer, William/0000-0003-3176-4452","Buchanan, Katherine/A-8178-2012 Careau, Vincent/A-9778-2008 ",NA,383,194,553,"#000000",NA,""

Using geolocators, we tracked the migrations of Scopoli's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea breeding in Linosa (Italy) across three years, and analysed timing and spatial aspects of their movements. Birds showed remarkable variation in their main wintering destination along the western coast of Africa. We found significant individual consistency in the total distance traveled, time spent in transit, and time that individuals spent in the wintering areas. We found extensive sex differences in scheduling, duration, distances and destinations of migratory journeys. We also found sex differences in the degree of individual consistency in aspects of migration behaviour. Despite strong evidence for individual consistency, which indicates that migration journeys from the same bird tended to be more similar than those of different birds, there remained substantial intra-individual variation between years. Indeed, we also found clear annual differences in departure dates, return dates, wintering period, the total distance traveled and return routes from wintering grounds back to the colony.

Subsequently, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the kappa index (K) were calculated for each of these parameters. The ``percentage of time spent in the novel compartment{''} (ICC = 0.727; K = 0.457), the ``percentage of distance travelled in the novel compartment{''} (ICC = 0.680; K = 0.370), and the ``percentage of time rearing in the novel compartment{''} (ICC = 0.648; kappa = 0.309) were found to be stable over time. Analysis of these parameters indicated fair to substantial reliability over time in two-month inter-trial interval. Therefore, our results support the idea of the free-exploratory paradigm as an animal model of trait anxiety for female rats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, there has been little work assessing the influence of commonly-measured personality traits on fitness, which is pertinent when the genetic basis of personality is considered. We measured whether the reproductive behaviour and success of zebra finches in a captive mixed-sex aviary environment was influenced by an aspect of their personality, their exploratory behaviour in a single-sex social aviary. We found that more exploratory males made a greater number of breeding attempts and raised more nestlings than less exploratory males. These results were not confounded by extra-pair paternity, which was not related to personality, or by the individuals that did not initiate any reproductive attempts at all. Our work provides evidence that attributes of personality may influence the degree to which individuals cope with, and thrive in a captive environment and this should be accounted for in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Furthermore, this suggests that there may be selection on these traits as part of the domestication process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such traits are, therefore, predicted to exhibit high repeatability. However, studies have shown that courtship behaviors vary greatly in their within-individual repeatability, resulting in substantial variation in their ability to reflect male quality. This has implications for the evolution of female mate choice and courtship communication, as low levels of repeatability may reflect courtship signals that do not provide accurate quality information to females. In this article, we tested whether male courtship shuddering in the tropical orb-web spider, Argiope radon, influences female mate choice. We also tested whether male shudder performance reflects male phenotypic condition and is repeatable. We found that male shudder performance and condition predicted female latency to move onto the mating thread, a measure of mate preference. Aspects of male shudder performance were positively correlated with male body condition. Further, we found surprisingly high levels of repeatability in male courtship shuddering, ranking among the highest levels recorded to date for courtship behavior. We suggest that male courtship shuddering functions as an important indicator of male quality, with strong potential to respond to selection.","10.1093/beheco/aru083","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000342360200013",NA,"Herberstein, Marie/0000-0001-5071-2952 Kemp, Darrell/0000-0002-5845-5513",NA,NA,387,233,529,"#000000",NA,""

An innovative scoring system (SC-PPAT/c: Symbolic Content in PPAT/children: Bat Or et al., 2014) was developed for scoring symbolic aspects in PPAT as related to the drawn objects in the drawing person, tree, and apple - as well as their inter-relationships. Specifically, this study explored correlations between PPATs symbolic content with cognitive (executive functions) and emotional behaviors, self-potency, and motivation of 126 children who were measured by valid tools, respectively: four BRIEF scales (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, \& Kenworthy, 2000), three CBCL scales - Child Behavior Check List (Achenbach, 1991), CAMP - Child Adaptation and Measure of Potency (Lev-Weizel, Besser, \& Laish, 2005); and the CMS: Children's Motivation Scale (Gerring et al., 1996). The SC-PPAT/c was found to be a reliable tool in terms of inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient range r=.785-.969) and valid in terms of significant associations with cognitive and emotional aspects. Significant negative correlations were found between low cognitive executive functions and the degree the person was drawn as being active in the picking process (r=-.259, p < 0.01), with trunk inclines toward the person (r=-.283, p < 0.01), and with degree of success in the picking process (r=-.210, p < 0.05). Significant and meaningful gender differences were found in regards to the relation of PPAT with all validity criterion variables. For example, while a positive strong correlation was found between girls' aggressiveness and the strength of the tree r=.363 (p < 0.01), a negative correlation was found between boy's aggressiveness and the quantity of apples on the tree r=-.392 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, while boys' PPAT was related to motivation, girls' PPAT was related to self-potency. The discussion deals with the possible meanings of the current results, especially in regard to gender differences in PPAT drawings. Replication studies using clinical groups and samples from different cultures will be needed to assess the generalizability of the results and the diagnostic potential of the SC-PPAT/c with clinical populations.

Participants were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, the Me and My School Study and the Research with East London Adolescent Community Health Survey. Outcome variables included risk behaviours (smoking, alcohol/cannabis use, sexual behaviour), behavioural difficulties and victimisation, obesity and physical activity, mental and emotional health, and educational attainment. Multi-level models were used to calculate the proportion of variance in outcomes explained at school level, expressed as intraclass correlations (ICCs) adjusted for gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status of the participants. ICCs for health outcomes ranged from nearly nil to .28 and were almost uniformly lower than for attainment (. 17-. 23). Most adjusted ICCs were smaller than unadjusted values, suggesting that school-level variation partly reflects differences in pupil demographics. School-level variation was highest for risk behaviours. ICCs were largely comparable across datasets, as well as across years within datasets, suggesting that school-level variation in health remains fairly constant across adolescence. School-level variation in health outcomes remains significant after adjustment for individual demographic differences between schools, confirming likely effects for school environment. Variance is highest for risk behaviours, supporting the utility of school environment interventions for these outcomes.","10.1007/s11121-013-0414-6","1389-4986","1573-6695","ISI:000344805500016",NA,"Viner, Russell/0000-0003-3047-2247 BOND, LYNDAL/0000-0003-1693-5508 Stansfeld, Stephen/0000-0001-8716-3897 Goerzig, Anke/0000-0002-7623-0836 Fitzgerald-Yau, Natasha/0000-0001-8588-4463","Viner, Russell/A-1441-2009 ",NA,389,519,376,"#000000",NA,""

Fear tests are also used as part of welfare assessment programmes. Little is known about fear responses of turkeys. Specifically, it is unknown whether turkeys' fear responses are reliable which is important when developing tests for assessing welfare. This study examined the short(between days) and long-term (between weeks) changes in, and test-retest reliability of, turkeys' fear responses. Male commercial turkeys were housed in groups of four to six in 16 pens. Turkeys were individually tested in OF (n = 60) and TI (n = 66) tests. VA and NO tests were administered to groups of turkeys in their pens (n = 16). Turkeys were tested three times in each test. The first (Period 1) and second (Period 2) tests were administered on consecutive days between 4 and 6 weeks, and the third test (Period 3) between 8 and 10 weeks. Other than increased sitting and reduced standing during OF testing and more birds approaching and pecking the observer during VA testing (Period 2 vs. 1), frequencies of responses did not differ between test periods. However, test responses (e.g. latencies to ambulate, vocalise, approach and peck) differed between periods depending on the fear test used. All VA test measures differed between periods, whereas most TI test measures did not. Most OF and NO test measures differed between weeks, but not between days. Except for the number of vocalisations (r(s) = 0.39), most OF test responses were moderately reliable (r(s) > 0.40). The latency to vocalise (r(s) >= 0.51) and number of vocalisations (r(s) >= 0.59) were the most reliable TI test measures, whereas reliability of TI duration (r(s) <= 0.31) was low. All VA test measures were moderately to highly repeatable between days and weeks (e.g. latency to peck: r(s) >= 0.67). Reliability was lowest for the NO test, where only the latency to peck was moderately repeatable (r(s) = 0.61). These findings suggest that although some fear responses of turkeys change over time and with repeated testing, most OF, TI and VA responses are reliable between days and weeks. However, few NO test measures were reliable under the conditions of this study. Further research is needed to assess the validity of OF, TI, VA and NO tests for assessing fear responses of turkeys.

Furthermore, factors of the social environment may safeguard individuals from environmental stressors. In the study reported here, we tested the effects of moving into a new habitat on the mean, variance, and repeatability of individual behavioral tendencies between two social contexts (isolated vs. in a social group). Using the arid social spider, Stegodyphus dumicola (Araneae: Eresidae), we tested whether individuals' boldness was influenced by either (i) their time spent in a social group or (ii) their latency since having moved into a new habitat. We found that the effect of moving into a new habitat on individuals' boldness depended on whether spiders entered the novel environment in isolation or as part of a social group. Spiders that experienced a habitat shift with a social group showed no change in their average boldness, whereas individuals that shifted environments in isolation showed an increase in their mean boldness. Interestingly, neither of these trends was influenced by the time which had elapsed since the habitat shift, suggesting that shifting habitats has a lasting effect on isolated spiders' behavioral tendencies. Finally, we assessed how time spent in a new environment influenced colonies' collective foraging behavior. Here, we found that the longer social groups remained in a new environment, the faster the group responded to prey. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the effects of shifting physical environments on individuals' boldness may depend on individuals' social context, and that group tenure is associated with subtle shifts in colonies' collective foraging behavior.","10.1111/eth.12256","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000339381800010",NA,"Singh, Nishant/0000-0002-8262-5690 Modlmeier, Andreas/0000-0002-3095-488X",NA,NA,391,232,325,"#000000",NA,""

Behavioral variation is thought to be a key element of division of labor, but few studies have linked worker personality to task allocation. We investigated individual behavior in Leptothorax acervorum ant workers at two time points during the first three months of their life and in two different settings. We observed worker behavior in the nest (i.e. task allocation) and in standardized aggression, exploration and brood care experiments (i.e. personality) and found behavioral repeatability in foraging and exploration. Further, workers acted consistently across settings: workers with a more aggressive and exploratory personality type were more active in the nest. Moreover, ovarian development was associated with worker personality and task allocation: older workers with well-developed ovaries foraged less, but were more aggressive and exploratory. In accordance with the typical age-polyethism of social insects, workers became more active and foraged more as they grew older.

These differences can involve consistent variation in the level of a particular behaviour (personality) or differences in the way individuals adjust their behaviour to environmental gradients (plasticity). In prey species, feeding rates and vigilance vary with environmental, social and individual factors and the feeding rate/vigilance relationship reflects the trade-off between food acquisition and safety. While feeding rates and vigilance have been shown to vary between individuals in relation to group size and predation risk, how they relate to other factors has not yet been investigated, nor has between-individual variation in this trade-off. We studied between-individual variation in vigilance, feeding rates and their trade-off in female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, to see whether females showed consistent behavioural differences and different plasticity in relation to ecological (food patch richness), social (group sizes) and physiological (reproductive states) conditions. We addressed two contrasting hypotheses: an `ecological' hypothesis under which individuals facing the same conditions should behave similarly, and a `behavioural' hypothesis under which they should behave differently because of their own personality or plasticity. Female kangaroos tended to adjust their behaviours similarly in relation to ecological and social conditions, supporting the ecological hypothesis. However, they also showed differences in personality and plasticity in relation to their reproductive states that could not be explained by energetic demand alone; this was suggestive of different maternal strategies, thus supporting the behavioural hypothesis. Altogether these results suggest that consistent differences in animals' personality and behavioural plasticity can be promoted by physiological conditions and are not necessarily repeatable across different ecological contexts.

The first two lines of defence, aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency to these responses did not correlate with any of the female defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately, this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence behaviour against adult brood parasites in general.

Individual behaviour, however, may be constrained by between-individual variability in energy metabolism and may become unstable owing to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Here we tested the relationship between personality and physiology using wild-caught bank voles, Myodes glareolus, that varied according to mtDNA type (original or introgressed from Myodes rutilus). Personality traits and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals' consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however, this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the alternative compensation model. According to our findings, it is likely that consistent differences in behavioural patterns and mtDNA types promote variation between individuals in energy metabolism.

Behavioral tests, often observed by independent experts, can provide objective data, but capture only a short behavioral sequence in a defined situation and are practical only for small study cohorts. Questionnaires can be targeted to much larger populations and provide long-term perspectives on behaviors, including potential correlated environmental factors. However, questionnaires are sensitive for misinterpretations and the subjectivity of the participant may affect the outcome. Therefore, particular attention has to be paid to structure and form of the questions to ensure that the questionnaire measures what it is supposed to measure. We have initiated a program on genetic studies in canine anxiety and have developed a questionnaire for behavioral phenotyping. The aim of the questionnaire is to identify the most fearful dogs (cases) and dogs not showing fear (controls) within and across breeds for gene mapping purposes. Knowing the challenges in the phenotyping of complex neurobehavioral traits, the aim of this study was to assess the external and convergent validity and re-test reliability of the developed questionnaire. External validity was assessed by comparing questionnaire data against short behavioral test of selected dogs (N=54), and convergent validity was estimated using ``known group comparisons{''}, i.e. whether the dogs with separation anxiety have also more noise phobia. Re-test reliability was evaluated from the subsample (N=36) of the owners who filled the questionnaire twice within an 8-month period. We found an excellent correlation between questionnaire data and the behavioral test, and the most important questions on the fearful reactions toward strangers, had the highest correlation with the behavioral test in which the dog met a stranger (mean r(s) = 0.63). Convergent validity was also well demonstrated by showing that a known co-morbid anxiety trait, separation anxiety, was more common in noise sensitive dogs as expected (Wilcoxon rank-sum test chi(2)(1.1732) = 9.8, p < 0.01). Similarly, the test-retest reliability was good (mean values: 0.69 Spearman correlation; 0.59 Kappa value). Most importantly, the questions asking the frequency of fear reactions had excellent repeatability (mean frequency of fear reactions toward humans, dogs and situations 0.78 Spearman correlation, toward thunder, gunshot, fireworks, 0.76 Spearman correlation). These results encourage a conclusion that our questionnaire may serve as a reliable phenotyping tool for fearfulness in dogs, which, in turn, should help us to establish sufficiently large study cohorts for successful genetic analyses.

Identifying the genetic basis of behavioural variation in invasive species thus represents an important step towards understanding the evolutionary potential of the invader. Here, we sequenced a candidate region for neophilic/neophobic and activity behaviour - the complete exon 3 of the DRD4 gene - in 100 Yellow-crowned bishops (Euplectes afer) from two invasive populations in Spain and Portugal. The same birds were scored twice for activity behaviour while exposed to novel objects (battery or slice of apple) in captivity. Response to novel objects was repeatable (r=0.41) within individuals. We identified two synonymous DRD4SNPs that explained on average between 11\% and 15\% of the phenotypic variance in both populations, indicating a clear genetic component to the neophilic/neophobic/activity personality axis in this species. This consistently high estimated effect size was mainly due to the repeated measurement design, which excludes part of the within-individual nongenetic variance in the response to different novel objects. We suggest that the alternative alleles of these SNPs are likely introduced from the original population and maintained by weak or antagonistic selection during different stages of the invasion process. The identified genetic variants have not only the potential to serve as genetic markers of the neophobic/neophilic/activity personality axis, but may also help to understand the evolution of behaviour in these invasive bird populations.","10.1111/mec.12763","0962-1083","1365-294X","ISI:000337587700017",NA,"Tella, Jose/0000-0002-3038-7424 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950 Serrano, David/0000-0001-6205-386X Edelaar, Pim/0000-0003-4649-6366 Potti, Jaime/0000-0002-2284-0022 Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458","Tella, Jose/I-3707-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009 Serrano, David/B-5352-2013 Blas, Julio/A-2487-2012 Edelaar, Pim/P-5650-2014 ",NA,398,69,423,"#000000",NA,""

The repeatability of the number of hissing calls given was high, as was the latency to give the call. Additionally, natural nest predators attacked hissing and nonhissing females equally often. However, hissing females survived better than silent females. We tested responses of feral cats to playbacks of hissing call during their attacks of nest boxes and found that hissing calls prevented the predator attacks. Taken together, our findings indicate that hissing calls can deter predator attacks and potentially increase survival rates of nesting great tits or their offspring, or both. The propensity to give hissing calls may be related to personality type of incubating female great tits, which needs to be tested experimentally.","10.1007/s10211-013-0163-3","0873-9749","1437-9546","ISI:000336268200004",NA,NA,NA,NA,399,274,574,"#000000",NA,""

Principal component analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and aggression and the second tendency to freeze.

The latter PC, but not the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096).

Repeatability (R) of different aspects of energy metabolism and behavior has been demonstrated in a variety of organisms over short and long time intervals. Recent research suggests that consistent individual differences in behavior and energy metabolism might covary. Here we present new data on the repeatability of body mass, standard metabolic rate (SMR), voluntary exploratory behavior, and feeding rate in a semiaquatic salamander and ask whether individual variation in behavioral traits is correlated with individual variation in metabolism on a whole-animal basis and after conditioning on body mass. All measured traits were repeatable, but the repeatability estimates ranged from very high for body mass (R = 0.98), to intermediate for SMR (R = 0.39) and food intake (R = 0.58), to low for exploratory behavior (R = 0.25). Moreover, repeatability estimates for all traits except body mass declined over time (i.e., from 3 to 9 wk), although this pattern could be a consequence of the relatively low sample size used in this study. Despite significant repeatability in all traits, we find little evidence that behaviors are correlated with SMR at the phenotypic and among-individual levels when conditioned on body mass. Specifically, the phenotypic correlations between SMR and exploratory behavior were negative in all trials but significantly so in one trial only. Salamanders in this study showed individual variation in how their exploratory behavior changed across trials (but not body mass, SMR, and feed intake), which might have contributed to observed changing correlations across trials.","10.1086/675974","1522-2152","1537-5293","ISI:000334904300003",NA,"Careau, Vincent/0000-0002-2826-7837 Gifford, Matthew/0000-0003-1263-0010","Careau, Vincent/A-9778-2008 ",NA,402,287,172,"#000000",NA,""

We tested for support for the social niche specialization hypothesis in cooperative personality traits in wild female meerkats (Suricata suricatta) that compete for access to dominant social roles. As cooperation is costly and dominance is acquired by heavier females, we predicted that females that ultimately acquired dominant roles would show noncooperative personality types early in life and before and after role acquisition. Although we found large individual differences in repeatable cooperative behaviours, there was no indication that individuals that ultimately acquired dominance differed from unsuccessful individuals in their cooperative behaviour. Early-life behaviour did not predict social role acquisition later in life, nor was cooperative behaviour before and after role acquisition correlated in the same individuals.

Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study, overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g. lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and, at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual performance change significantly between data sets.","10.1007/s00265-014-1692-0","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000334436200010",NA,"Boulton, Kay/0000-0001-7830-5793 Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051",NA,NA,404,280,304,"#000000",NA,""

However, issues surrounding the measurement of implementation climate, or the extent to which organizational members perceive that innovation use is expected, supported and rewarded by their organization remain. Specifically, it is unclear whether implementation climate can be measured as a global construct, whether individual or group-referenced items should be used, and whether implementation climate can be assessed at the group or organizational level. Methods: This research includes two cross-sectional studies with data collected via surveys at the individual level. The first study assessed the implementation climate perceptions of physicians participating in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), and the second study assessed the perceptions of children's behavioral health clinicians implementing a treatment innovation. To address if implementation climate is a global construct, we used confirmatory factor analysis. To address how implementation climate should be measured and at what level, we followed a five-step framework outlined by van Mierlo and colleagues. This framework includes exploratory factor analysis and correlations to assess differences between individual and group-referenced items and intraclass correlations, interrater agreements, and exploratory factor analysis to determine if implementation climate can be assessed at the organizational level. Results: The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that implementation climate is a global construct consisting of items related to expectations, support and rewards. There are mixed results, however, as to whether implementation climate should be measured using individual or group-referenced items. In our first study, where physicians were geographically dispersed and practice independently, there were no differences based on the type of items used, and implementation climate was an individual level construct. However, in the second study, in which clinicians practice in a central location and interact more frequently, group-referenced items may be appropriate. In addition, implementation climate could be considered an organizational level construct. Conclusions: The results are context-specific. Researchers should carefully consider the study setting when measuring implementation climate. In addition, more opportunities are needed to validate this measure and understand how well it predicts and explains implementation effectiveness.","10.1186/1748-5908-9-46","1748-5908",NA,"ISI:000335605800001","46","Bunger, Alicia/0000-0002-6407-5111","Bunger, Alicia/B-9943-2013 ",NA,405,145,533,"#000000",NA,""

Further, IIV was highly repeatable (r = 0.61) between seasons and we found strong negative correlations between consistent individual differences in flight initiation distances, i.e. their boldness, and individuals' IIVs.

Such a link implies that the within-individual consistency in the same behavior has a genetic basis. Behavioral consistency is also prevalent in the form of between-individual correlation of functionally different behaviors; thus, the relationship between DRD4 polymorphism and exploration may also be manifested for other behaviors. Here, in a Hungarian population of the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, we investigate how males with distinct DRD4 genotypes differ in the consistent elements of their behavioral displays during the courtship period. In completely natural conditions, we assayed novelty avoidance, aggression and risk-taking, traits that were previously shown repeatable over time and correlate with each other, suggesting that they could have a common mechanistic basis. We identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP554 and SNP764) in the exon 3 of the DRD4 gene by sequencing a subsample, then we screened 202 individuals of both sexes for these SNPs. Focusing on the genotypic variation in courting males, we found that ``AC{''} heterozygote individuals at the SNP764 take lower risk than the most common ``AA{''} homozygotes (the ``CC{''} homozygotes were not represented in our subsample of males). We also found a considerable effect size for the relationship between SNP554 polymorphism and novelty avoidance. Therefore, in addition to exploration, DRD4 polymorphisms may also be associated with the regulation of behaviors that may incur fear or stress. Moreover, polymorphisms at the two SNPs were not independent indicating a potential role for genetic constraints or another functional link, which may partially explain behavioral correlations.","10.1002/ece3.1041","2045-7758",NA,"ISI:000345854500005",NA,"Zsebok, Sandor/0000-0003-4463-4753 Torok, Janos/0000-0002-4799-5522 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","Zsebok, Sandor/H-4768-2015 Torok, Janos/C-6144-2008 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,407,611,479,"#000000",NA,""

A link between personality and social skills seems obvious from a human perspective and it is therefore surprising that relatively few studies have looked at the effect of animal personality on communicative interactions. In this study we tested the evidence for personality-related variation in birds during vocal interactions in the field. We scored individual variation in exploratory behaviour of great tits, Parus major, in repeated trials of a novel environment test in the laboratory and related this score to approach and vocal behaviour in response to playback of conspecific songs in the field. Contrary to our expectation, we found males with low exploration scores approached the speaker more closely than birds with high exploration scores. Birds with high exploration scores seemed to respond less aggressively while dealing with the simulated intruder vocally by switching song types more often. Our results suggest that slow-exploring birds in the laboratory respond more strongly during natural interactions in the field. An independent and very similar study also revealed a correlation between personality score and playback response, but with a seemingly contrasting outcome. A comparison of the two studies provides insights into the complexity of interpreting playback results and territorial response patterns in general.

Animals often modify their behaviours according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also retain consistent individual differences across environmental change (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour.

Although theory is rapidly developing in this area, there are few empirical tests. There are at least two hypotheses to explain why individuals behave differently from one another in a dynamic social environment. The social niche specialization hypothesis proposes that repeated social interactions generate consistent individual differences in social behaviour. The behavioural type hypothesis proposes that an individual's social behaviour reflects its behavioural type. We tested these two hypotheses by manipulating the opportunity for repeated social interactions in groups of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and by measuring the behavioural types of the same individuals in three contexts: when in a novel environment, when presented with an opportunity to associate with conspecifics and when confronted by an intruder. We found no evidence that repeated social interactions increased between-individual variation in social foraging behaviour. Instead, individuals' social foraging behaviour was related to their behavioural type, specifically their shoaling behaviour. In addition, the behavioural types of the members of a group strongly influenced a group's average foraging behaviour. Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that social dynamics within groups generates individual differences in behaviour. Instead, they suggest the reverse: individual differences in behaviour drive group-level dynamics. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These behavioural correlations, however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk. Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus, foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour, aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of pro-activity. We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display of antipredator behaviours.

We used a 3-level hierarchical structure of data: 1) characteristics of participants; 2) mean of tertiary education of each city; and 3) country inequality indicator (Gini coefficient). Multilevel logistic regression was used and proportional changes in Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were inspected to assert explained variance between models. Results: The prevalence of elder abuse showed large variations across sites. Adding tertiary education to the regression model reduced the country level variance for psychological abuse (ICC = 3.4\%), with no significant decrease in the explained variance for the other types of abuse.

We explored whether a behavioral syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during 2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1) hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38\% repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation. Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this heterogeneity.","10.1093/beheco/aru008","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000336484600020",NA,"Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612 Fresneau, Nolwenn/0000-0003-3427-6032","Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008 ",NA,414,17,85,"#000000",NA,""

We surveyed individual refuge use of mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat, and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size, crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be more repeatable over time.","10.1007/s00265-013-1666-7","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000332980500017",NA,NA,NA,NA,415,195,641,"#000000",NA,""

Many studies focus on intraindividual repeatability, but few note population-wide trends in personality change. In part, this results from the large sample size that is required to detect such trends. In the present study, we measured personality in a large sample (N = 293) of adult, mother-reared pigtailed macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over a period of 3 years. We looked at four personality components (sociability towards humans, cautiousness, aggressiveness and fearfulness) derived from behavioural observations at two to four time points per subject. We found these components to have repeatabilities similar to those reported elsewhere in the literature. We then analysed population-wide changes in personality components over time using a linear mixed effects model with three predictors: entry age at the current primate facility, tenure at the primate facility at the time of the first personality test and time elapsed since the first personality test. We found that adult personality changed with life experiences (here, tenure at the facility where tested) and age. Throughout adulthood, pigtailed macaques became less cautious and more aggressive. At the same time, subjects became less cautious and more sociable with increasing time in individual caging at the current primate research facility. We also found that individuals differed significantly in their personality consistency. Other researchers may benefit by applying similar methodology to that described here as they extrapolate about personality measures over time.

However there is much overlap between the two fields, both aiming to measure the causes and consequences of consistent individual behaviour. Here for the first time we use both a classic measure of personality, the response to a novel object, and an estimate of foraging strategy, derived from GPS data, to examine individual personality differences in black browed albatross and their consequences for fitness. First, we examine the repeatability of personality scores and link these to variation in foraging habitat. Bolder individuals forage nearer the colony, in shallower regions, whereas shyer birds travel further from the colony, and fed in deeper oceanic waters. Interestingly, neither personality score predicted a bird's overlap with fisheries. Second, we show that both personality scores are correlated with fitness consequences, dependent on sex and year quality. Our data suggest that shyer males and bolder females have higher fitness, but the strength of this relationship depends on year quality. Females who forage further from the colony have higher breeding success in poor quality years, whereas males foraging close to the colony always have higher fitness. Together these results highlight the potential importance of personality variation in seabirds and that the fitness consequences of boldness and foraging strategy may be highly sex dependent.","10.1371/journal.pone.0087269","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000330631800025","e87269",NA,NA,NA,417,431,275,"#000000",NA,""

The promise of quantitative genetics in unmanaged populations opens the door for simultaneous analysis of inheritance, phenotypic plasticity, and patterns of selection on behavioral phenotypes all within the same study. In this article, we describe how quantitative genetic techniques provide studies of the evolution of behavior with information that is unique and valuable. We outline technical obstacles for applying quantitative genetic techniques that are of particular relevance to studies of behavior in primates, especially those living in noncaptive populations, e.g., the need for pedigree information, non-Gaussian phenotypes, and demonstrate how many of these barriers are now surmountable. We illustrate this by applying recent quantitative genetic methods to spatial proximity data, a simple and widely collected primate social behavior, from adult rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago. Our analysis shows that proximity measures are consistent across repeated measurements on individuals (repeatable) and that kin have similar mean measurements (heritable). Quantitative genetics may hold lessons of considerable importance for studies of primate behavior, even those without a specific genetic focus.","10.1007/s10764-013-9709-5","0164-0291","1573-8604","ISI:000330954400007",NA,"Brent, Lauren/0000-0002-1202-1939",NA,NA,418,44,303,"#000000",NA,""

We infected Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) with the brain-encysted trematode parasite, Diplostomum phoxini, and studied whether infection could modify the personality of their hosts. Our results show that D. phoxini infection did not affect the mean levels of boldness, activity or exploration, but infected minnows showed higher repeatability in boldness and activity, and reduced repeatability in exploration. We also found that D. phoxini may be able to break the associations (behavioral syndromes) between behavioral traits, but that this effect may be dependent on parasite intensity. Furthermore, the effect of D. phoxini infection on personality of the hosts was found to be nonlinearly dependent on infection intensity. Taken together, our results suggest that D. phoxini parasites may shape the personality of their hosts, but that behavioral consequences of ecologically relevant infection levels may be rather subtle and easily remain undetected if only the mean trait expressions are compared.","10.1007/s00265-013-1634-2","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000329628200003",NA,"Kortet, Raine/0000-0003-3749-1096 Vainikka, Anssi/0000-0002-0172-5615","Kortet, Raine/J-5027-2012 ",NA,420,175,527,"#000000",NA,""

To be able to understand how an individual's behavioural, physiological and life history traits may coevolve, we need to jointly quantify these traits in order to study their covariance. Few studies have established links between personality and immunity properties of an individual. We here examined covariation of a measure of skeletal size (tarsus length), three behavioural traits (activity, handling aggression and breath rate) and two immunological traits (IgG level and haematocrit), in 592 wild caught blue tits. Many individuals (201) were tested more than once, allowing quantification of individual consistency of all traits and partition of the covariances between the traits, using a multivariate mixed model, into between individual and residual covariances. We find individual consistency of all behavioural traits, indicating that these capture aspects of blue tit adult personality and also the physiological measures are repeatable. Contrary to the POLS expectation, we find no overall significant individual level correlation structure between these traits and a factor analytical approach confirmed that between individual correlations across traits were not due to a common (POLS) factor or driven by size (tarsus length). Based on a published power study, we conclude that there is no common syndrome of individual level covariance between personality and physiological traits in wild blue tits or that the effect sizes, such a syndrome generates, are too low (r < 0.3) to detect. Future field-based work should be designed to explore low effect sizes and strive to measure specific traits whose involvement is implicated to have large effect sizes as based on, e.g. laboratory findings.","10.1007/s00265-013-1635-1","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000329628200004",NA,"Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612","Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008",NA,421,576,217,"#000000",NA,""

However, at present rideability is evaluated rather subjectively in breeding horse performance tests. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role horse behaviour as well as degree and quality of rein tension might play in judges' evaluation of horses' rideability. Mares (n = 33) and stallions (n = 13) from two different mare-and one stallion-testing station were observed twice during their performance test dressage training. During these rides, rein tension was measured continuously, and frequency of behaviour patterns such as head-tossing, tail swishing, and snorting was recorded. Rein tension parameters showed reasonable repeatabilities within horse-rider pairs (e. g. mean rein tension: r(2) = 0.61 +/- 0.11; variance of rein tension: r(2) = 0.52 +/- 0.14). Regression analysis revealed that a larger proportion of variance in rideability scores could be explained by maximum (17\%), mean (16\%) and variance (15\%) of rein tension compared to horses' or riders' behavioural parameters (tail-swishing: 5\% and rider's use of hands: 5\%, respectively). According to mixed model analysis, rideability scores dropped (all P<0.05) with increasing mean, maximum and variability in rein tension (e. g. -0.37 +/- 0.14 scores per additional 10 Newton in mean tension). However, mean rein tension differed between testing stations (P<0.0001) ranging between 9.1 +/- 1.6 N in one station and 21.7 +/- 1.3 N in another station. These results indicate that quantity and consistency of rein tension is either directly or indirectly an important factor for judges to derive rideability scores. Given the importance of rein tension parameters to both rider comfort and horse welfare, potentially, measurements of rein tension along with behaviour observations assessing the quality of rein contact (e. g. distinguishing a light contact from attempts to evade contact) might be used to make the assessment of rideability more impartial.","10.1371/journal.pone.0087285","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000330570000130","e87285",NA,NA,NA,423,37,248,"#000000",NA,""

This study asks whether a significant portion of the variance in the aggression-signal regression may be explained by individual differences in signalling strategies. Using the well-studied aggressive signalling system of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), we carried out repeated assays to measure both aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling of territorial males. Through these assays, we found that aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling were both highly repeatable, and moreover that aggressive behaviours in 2009-2010 predicted whether the birds would attack a taxidermic mount over a year later. Most significantly, we found that residual variation in signalling behaviours, after controlling for aggressive behaviour, was individually consistent, suggesting there may be a second personality trait determining the level of aggressive signalling. We term this potential personality trait `communicativeness' and discuss these results in the context of honest signalling theories and recent findings reporting prevalence of `under-signalling'.","10.1098/rspb.2013.2496","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000332380800011","20132496","Akcay, Caglar/0000-0003-0635-9586","Akcay, Caglar/F-7145-2010",NA,424,297,20,"#405d99","selected",""

Thus, we evaluated the use of safe versus risky foraging patches by male and female meadow voles using putatively safe and risky habitats. We also used behavioural trials to assess whether sexual differences in personality could account for any differences in patch use. Voles preferred to forage in safe patches over risky ones. There was no difference between male and female voles, or between reproductive and non-reproductive individuals, in their respective use of safe versus risky foraging patches. Personality also had no effect on patch choice. The results are consistent with recent studies on other species that have failed to find differences in reproductive costs between the sexes.

We found high short- and long-term repeatability of aggressive and anxiety-related behaviours when confronted with a nest intruder and novel objects, but lower repeatability during social stimulation. Contextual plasticity was highly repeatable across years for aggressive behaviours, and low for anxiety-related behaviours. Plasticity did not correlate across behaviours into a `meta-personality' trait. Contextual plasticity in behavioural traits was highly correlated with the expression of those traits, suggesting that individuals are able to both react strongly and modify their behaviour depending on context, perhaps due to consistent differences in individual quality. Model selection exercises using structural equation models evaluated the relationships between personality factors, indicating a behavioural syndrome in which anxiety- or agitation-related behaviours covary strongly and positively, and both covary weakly and negatively with aggression.","10.1163/1568539X-00003185","0005-7959","1568-539X","ISI:000339857700004",NA,NA,NA,NA,427,414,323,"#000000",NA,""

However, how exposure affects behavioral consistency over time is not commonly addressed. To examine the effects of chronic EE2 exposure on behavioral consistency, adult male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, received multiple trials with a dummy male and dummy female presented simultaneously both before and after chronic exposure to a nominal dose (10 ng/l) of EE2. The responses of exposed males were compared before and after exposure and against those of a group of unexposed, control males. Male-directed and female-directed behaviors were reduced after 28 days of EE2 exposure. More importantly, chronic EE2 exposure had dramatic effects on consistent individual differences in female-directed and male-directed behaviors. Repeatability values were markedly lower and level of response was less correlated in the EE2 group, suggesting that exposure disrupts both between-individual variation and behavioral consistency. These results cannot be explained by a temporal effect as they were not found in the control group of unexposed males. This study demonstrates that EE2 exposure may have effects beyond a reduction in overall response. It also demonstrates the importance of studying the effects of chemical exposure on multiple time scales as acute exposure to EE2 affects the consistency of only female-directed behaviors in this species whereas chronic exposure affects consistency of both female-directed and male-directed behavior. Finally, this study suggests that males in this species may differ in their sensitivity, an important area for future research.","10.1163/1568539X-00003153","0005-7959","1568-539X","ISI:000333546700005",NA,"Dzieweczynski, Teresa/0000-0002-5182-9914",NA,NA,429,109,581,"#000000",NA,""

Many genetic loci have been identified and now require functional investigation. One approach involves studying their correlation with neuroimaging and neurocognitive endophenotypes. Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits are well established in schizophrenia and they appear to fulfill criteria for being considered an endophenotype. We aim to review the behavioral and neuroimaging-based studies of ToM in schizophrenia, assess its suitability as an endophenotype, discuss current findings, and propose future research directions. Suitable research articles were sourced from a comprehensive literature search and from references identified through other studies. ToM deficits are repeatable, stable, and heritable: First-episode patients, those in remission and unaffected relatives all show deficits. Activation and structural differences in brain regions believed important for ToM are also consistently reported in schizophrenia patients at all stages of illness, although no research to date has examined unaffected relatives. Studies using ToM as an endophenotype are providing interesting genetic associations with both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and specific copy number variations (CNVs) such as the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

Such foraging specialisations are common among marine vertebrates, yet it is not clear how individuals repeatedly locate prey or foraging sites at ocean-wide scales. Using GPS and time-depth loggers we studied the fine-scale foraging behaviour of central-place northern gannets Morus bassanus at two large colonies. First, we estimated the degree of consistency in individual foraging routes and sites across repeated trips. Second, we tested for individual differences in searching behaviour in response to environmental covariates using reaction norms, estimated from mixed effect models. Adult gannets tracked over multiple foraging trips showed repeatable between-individual differences in terminal points and departure angles of foraging trips, but low repeatability in trip duration and trip length. Importantly, individual birds showed highly repeatable dive locations, with consistently different environmental conditions (such as copepod abundance), suggesting a high degree of foraging site specialisation. Gannets also showed between-individual differences in searching behaviour along environmental gradients, such that individuals intensified searching under different conditions. Together these results suggest that widespread individual foraging consistency may represent specialisation and be linked with individual responses to environmental conditions. Such divergent searching behaviour could provide a mechanism by which consistent foraging behaviour arises and is maintained among animals that forage across large spatial scales.","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00406.x","0030-1299","1600-0706","ISI:000328586800005",NA,"Grecian, James/0000-0002-6428-719X Votier, Stephen/0000-0002-0976-0167 Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129","Grecian, James/A-7689-2012 Votier, Stephen/G-2348-2014 ",NA,432,299,595,"#000000",NA,""

Personality traits also affect habitat choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping), both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics.","10.1111/eth.12181","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000328215000008",NA,"Ost, Markus/0000-0002-2205-1437 ","Ost, Markus/C-7376-2008 Jaatinen, Kim/A-3221-2011",NA,433,92,510,"#000000",NA,""

This phenomenon has been referred to as animal personality or behavioural syndromes. Little is known about consistency of animal personalities over entire life times. We investigated the repeatability of behaviour in common voles (Microtus arvalis) at different life stages, with different time intervals, and in different situations. Animals were tested using four behavioural tests in three experimental groups: 1. before and after maturation over three months, 2. twice as adults during one week, and 3. twice as adult animals over three months, which resembles a substantial part of their entire adult life span of several months. Results: Different behaviours were correlated within and between tests and a cluster analysis showed three possible behavioural syndrome-axes, which we name boldness, exploration and activity. Activity and exploration behaviour in all tests was highly repeatable in adult animals tested over one week. In animals tested over maturation, exploration behaviour was consistent whereas activity was not. Voles that were tested as adults with a three-month interval showed the opposite pattern with stable activity but unstable exploration behaviour. Conclusions: The consistency in behaviour over time suggests that common voles do express stable personality over short time. Over longer periods however, behaviour is more flexible and depending on life stage (i.e. tested before/after maturation or as adults) of the tested individual. Level of boldness or activity does not differ between tested groups and maintenance of variation in behavioural traits can therefore not be explained by expected future assets as reported in other studies.","10.1186/1472-6785-13-49","1472-6785",NA,"ISI:000329942100001","49",NA,NA,NA,434,124,650,"#000000",NA,""

How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is important for determining the function and evolution of animal personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots' response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage. This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus, the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping with age-dependent requirements and constraints. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values associated with activity would increase between newly volant, pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a 24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats.

Behaviours are, however, often plastic and to explain how plasticity and personality may coexist an adaptive framework has been developed. Still, there is little information on how personality is impacted by situations and contexts on an individual level. We investigated this in the European mink (Mustela lutreola) by performing a set of five experiments in two situations consisting of non-breeding and breeding season, and by using different test contexts. Three personality trait domains were identified; boldness, exploration and sociability. The levels of boldness and exploration changed between seasons but remained repeatable, which implies behavioural reaction norms and supports that the concept of personality remained applicable despite plasticity. Whilst males became bolder and more explorative in the breeding season females became shyer, which reflects European mink breeding behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours performed in mirror stimulus tests fell into different domains depending on whether, the test was conducted in the own territory or not, suggesting plasticity in the response towards conspecifics. To conclude, our results highlight the importance of situation and context for the expression of personality, and the significance of measuring multiple personality trait domains with several methods.

Furthermore, although much theoretical and empirical work assumes selection shapes variation in personalities, studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of personality traits are rare. Here we study one standard axis of personality, the shy-bold continuum, in a long-lived marine species, the wandering albatross from Possession Island, Crozet, by measuring the behavioral response to a human approach. Using generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable. We also find strong differences in boldness between breeding colonies, which vary in size and density, suggesting birds are shyer in more dense colonies.

Furthermore, animals often show unpredictability in how much they respond to these events over time leading to the suggestion that personality and intraindividual variability (IIV) might have important fitness consequences. We investigated this hypothesis by focusing on the tendency for individually identifiable male fallow deer, Dama dama, to escalate low-level (noncontact) agonistic interactions to fighting during the rut. Males differed in their tendency to escalate noncontact interactions to fighting; however, repeatability in escalation rates was unstable over the rut suggesting that escalation rate is a poor measure of personality. There was no difference in the level of IIV in escalation rate shown by males. A comparison of IIV recorded over two consecutive annual ruts showed that IIV was highly correlated between years; therefore, over an extended time period individuals were consistent in their willingness to engage in fighting. There was a nonlinear relationship between IIV and mating success; specifically, individuals that showed either low or high IIV in escalation rate had lower mating success than individuals that showed intermediate levels of IIV. Aggression and the willingness to commit to fighting are important fitness correlates; nevertheless, our understanding of how personality and IIV are related to aggression is poorly understood. This study shows that although escalation rate appears to be a poor measure of personality in the fallow deer, IIV is related to increased fitness in individuals that show intermediate levels of predictability in their willingness to fight over the rut.

We attempted to validate whether a single assay of this type is correlated with other similar assays of boldness under more familiar, and less stressful, situations. We compared single emergence test scores of two species of damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi; P.amboinensis) in a novel environment, with two different behavioral assays of the same fish in subsequent repeated trials in home tanks. Although behavior was highly repeatable in home tanks, we found no correlation between emergence test scores in the novel environment and measures of latency to emerge from shelter following disturbance, or activity levels, on the first, second, or third observations in home tanks; there was also no correlation when we used average home tank scores from mixed models that accounted for individual differences (i.e., plasticity) in the rate of habituation (latency) and acclimation (activity).

In most tests of temperament or personality, observation of the animal takes place over a short period of time, sometimes completed in a matter of minutes. This study investigated whether behavior observed in a temperament test was reflective of the steer's behavior in the home pen. Indoor-housed, crossbred, Bos taurus beef steers (n = 67) were fitted with triaxial activity monitors (IceTags; IceRobotics Ltd., South Queensferry, Edinburgh, Scotland) and activity was recorded for 2 periods of 14 d each. Also, each steer was scored on 4 measures of temperament: 2 handling tests (flight speed and chute score) and 2 feeding behavior scores (aggression at feeders and ability to displace at feeders). Each temperament observation was repeated 4 times, with repeatability of the traits ranging from 0.23 (aggression) to 0.48 (flight speed). Activity measures derived from the accelerometer data, such as bout lengths, were found to be highly repeatable between the 2 periods of activity monitoring (repeatabilities of 0.67 and 0.70 for average lying bout duration and average standing bout duration, respectively). Steers with high flight speeds were also more active in the home pen (MotionIndex: r(s) = 0.35, P = 0.004; average step count: r(s) = 0.34, P = 0.005) than steers with low flight speeds. Steers that were more capable of displacing other steers at feeders had longer average standing bout durations (r(s) = 0.26, P = 0.036), which were more variable (standing time SD: r(s) = 0.27, P = 0.030), and lay down for less time (r(s) = -0.35, P = 0.004).

Animals may benefit from evaluating the quality of cache items in terms of size, nutrition and storage viability. Steller's jays, Cyanocitta stelleri, which cache seeds for later consumption, may handle multiple food items with their beak prior to making a selection. By picking items up, individuals may use visual and tactile cues to evaluate size and shell condition. The number of items an individual jay handles is repeatable, reflecting consistent individual-specific foraging behaviours that may differentiate success at selecting high-quality cache items. In this study we quantified population-level preferences for food items based on size and shell integrity, and individual Steller's jay sampling behaviour when presented with these choices. Using field trials with free-ranging subjects, we quantified sampling frequency in a variety of choice tests and measured individuals' success at choosing higher-quality items. We found that Steller's jays selected items of greater weight and items with intact shells, and preferences for these properties were of comparable magnitude. Jays sampled more nuts during choice sets involving cracked and intact shells, resulting in individuals selecting more profitable nuts for caching. These results may suggest that Steller's jays evaluate cache items based on both current and future expected energetic values, and that sampling behaviour may enable them to choose more valuable forage items.

Behavioral consistency has been shown to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses, which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations. Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females: 2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was influenced by season in the other year. Parental age, brood size, and the number of house sparrows around the nest site did not affect nest defense behavior. We conclude that Eastern bluebirds demonstrate consistent nest defense behavior, or personality, although males are more plastic than females.","10.1007/s10211-013-0143-7","0873-9749","1437-9546","ISI:000324489400002",NA,NA,NA,NA,446,505,345,"#000000",NA,""

RR estimates the between-individual variance in elevation (expected behavior in the mean environment) and variance in plasticity (individual-specific adjustment of behavior to the environment) and the covariance between these properties. These (co)variances allow deriving both environment-specific repeatability estimates and the individual-level correlation in behavior between environmental conditions, both of which are of key interest for understanding consistency in behavior over space and time, a core issue in animal personality research. However, very few studies use the RR estimates to produce this information. In this paper, I outline how to extract this information (including example code in R) and apply the approach to 16 estimates based on nine published RR studies. Despite the fact that the behaviors have a decent repeatability under different environmental conditions, I find that in half the cases, the cross-environmental correlation is low (< 0.4). This implies that individuals differ in their behavioral trait values but that the ranking of these individual values tends to change between environmental conditions. This level of inconsistency in animal personality traits appears not to have been fully appreciated, and future studies on plasticity using RR should explicitly include it.","10.1007/s00265-013-1603-9","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000324104500016",NA,"Brommer, Jon/0000-0002-2435-2612","Brommer, Jon/C-3613-2008",NA,447,647,661,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we investigated the between-season repeatability of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) aggression towards a stuffed dummy of the brood parasitic common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). We found that under the relatively stable risk of brood parasitism across breeding seasons, female responses to the cuckoo were highly repeatable, whereas male responses were variable. We suggest that the potential explanation for the observed patterns of female and male behaviours may lie in female's prominent roles in offspring care and nest protection, and in her lower renesting potential in comparison with that of males. However, further studies on the relationship between host aggression and other types of behaviours (host personality) and their fitness consequences under the fluctuating parasitism pressures are required to clarify the adaptive significance of aggressive behaviour observed in hosts of brood parasites.","10.1111/eth.12133","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000323729900013",NA,"Pozgayova, Milica/0000-0002-3870-3196 ","Pozgayova, Milica/A-1133-2011 Samas, Peter/E-3152-2016 Honza, Marcel/A-1123-2011",NA,448,491,353,"#000000",NA,""

However, little is known about how precalving temperament, postcalving defensiveness, and maternal care are related. The impacts of cow temperament on calf neonatal vigor and ADG are also unknown. Data were collected on 2 farms (Farm 1, n = 143, 1 parity; Farm 2, n = 237, 2 parities). Temperament was recorded before calving when restrained in a crush (crush score), on exit from the crush (flight speed), and when isolated with a handler. Defensiveness was recorded within 4 d after calving during handling of the calf. Maternal interactions with the calf and calf vigor were recorded for 3 h after calving (Farm 1 only) and ADG was measured over 7 mo. Crush score and flight speed were repeatable within a parity (range in repeatability 0.33 to 0.49; P < 0.001). Crush score (0.50; P < 0.001) and defensiveness (up to 0.71; P < 0.001) were repeatable across parities. Temperament and defensiveness were unrelated on Farm 1; on Farm 2 a fearful crush score was associated with heightened defensiveness as measured by vigorous movement during calf handling (P < 0.001). Temperament and defensiveness were unrelated to calving ease or the amount of maternal behavior shown to the calf. At Farm 1, cows that exited the crush quickly had calves with a lighter birth weight (P = 0.023) and those that were agitated when isolated had calves with a decreased ADG (P = 0.017). Defensiveness was unrelated to ADG and neither temperament nor defensiveness affected calf vigor. Cow precalving temperament and postcalving defensiveness are repeatable but appear to be independent traits, neither of which is related to maternal interactions with the neonatal calf. Reducing precalving fearfulness should not affect postcalving behavior and changing postcalving defensiveness should not affect other maternal care traits. Fearful cows may produce calves with decreased birth weight and ADG, which, if confirmed, suggests that cow fearfulness may have wider economic implications than previously realized.","10.2527/jas2012-5707","0021-8812",NA,"ISI:000323602200039",NA,"Lawrence, Alistair/0000-0002-2083-4243",NA,NA,449,451,629,"#000000",NA,""

Such consistencies can arise because of the common innate government of traits (i.e., temperament). However, different behaviors can be mediated by different selection regimes and/or measured with different errors. Furthermore, contextual overlap among traits may also vary. These possibilities can cause dissimilarities in the pair-wise relationship between particular traits. To determine the relationships among the most studied behaviors, we performed a modern meta-analysis, in which we assessed the strength of correlations in each possible combination of traits. Relying on data from 81 scientific papers, we found that the correlations among behaviors were generally weak and that they varied in magnitude across comparisons (e.g., novel environment exploration and activity: r 0.345; novel object exploration and activity: r 0.074). The partial correlations among traits revealed that certain relationships (e.g., novel environment exploration/activity and the novel object exploration/risk taking) were independent of the covariation with other traits, whereas certain relationships (e.g., aggression/novel environment exploration) consistently weakened after controlling for covariance. Some relationships were affected by contextual overlap: the effect sizes were systematically higher when the behaviors were assayed in the same experimental compartment (e.g., same test room or aquarium). Different correlations are unlikely to emerge due to differences in repeatabilities that are associated with the measurement of different traits, as we found that averaged repeatabilities vary around the same intermediate magnitude for each behavior. We suggest that the most commonly assessed behavioral traits do not necessarily form equally independent domains.","10.1093/beheco/art033","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000322957800011",NA,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011",NA,450,12,411,"#000000",NA,""

Behavior in tests for exploration and social interaction covaried among individuals, suggesting a behavioral syndrome, although we could only demonstrate within-individual repeatability in the test for social interaction. These 2 behaviors changed geographically with the ecology of sites (degree of climate variation) in an apparently adaptive way, rather than with the direction of invasion. We found behavioral plasticity but showed that short-term plastic effects do not explain geographic divergence. Differential dispersal does not explain geographic divergence either, which is orthogonal to the direction of invasion. Results are best interpreted either as evolved divergences, although a candidate-gene approach could not identify genetic correlates of behavior, or as long-term behavioral plasticity (e.g., effects of rearing environment). In this recent invasion, geographic differences in ecology and behavior equate to repeated and fast changes over time. Thus, fluctuations in ecological conditions, which are common in nature, may have a widespread role maintaining behavioral and personality differences via selection and/or long-term behavioral plasticity.","10.1093/beheco/art034","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000322957800012",NA,"Reis, Sandra/0000-0002-9479-7115 Cardoso, Goncalo/0000-0001-6258-1881 Lopes, Ricardo/0000-0003-2193-5107 Leitao, Ana/0000-0001-5367-9158 Mota, Paulo/0000-0002-1880-5574 Batalha, Helena/0000-0002-3418-6005","Reis, Sandra/F-2283-2015 Cardoso, Goncalo/A-1290-2007 Lopes, Ricardo/B-1805-2010 Leitao, Ana/I-5863-2014 ",NA,451,428,147,"#000000",NA,""

An extreme form of anthropogenic alteration is the existence and rapid increase of urban areas. A key question, then, is how species cope with urbanization. It has been suggested that rural and urban conspecifics show differences in behaviour and personality. However, (i) a generalization of this phenomenon has never been made; and (ii) it is still unclear whether differences in personality traits between rural and urban conspecifics are the result of phenotypic plasticity or of intrinsic differences. In a literature review, we show that behavioural differences between rural and urban conspecifics are common and taxonomically widespread among animals, suggesting a significant ecological impact of urbanization on animal behaviour. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms leading to behavioural differences in urban individuals, we hand-raised and kept European blackbirds (Turdus merula) from a rural and a nearby urban area under common-garden conditions. Using these birds, we investigated individual variation in two behavioural responses to the presence of novel objects: approach to an object in a familiar area (here defined as neophilia), and avoidance of an object in a familiar foraging context (defined as neophobia). Neophilic and neophobic behaviours were mildly correlated and repeatable even across a time period of one year, indicating stable individual behavioural strategies. Blackbirds from the urban population were more neophobic and seasonally less neophilic than blackbirds from the nearby rural area. These intrinsic differences in personality traits are likely the result of microevolutionary changes, although we cannot fully exclude early developmental influences.","10.1111/gcb.12258","1354-1013",NA,"ISI:000322758000004",NA,"Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261 Miranda, Ana Catarina/0000-0002-9066-6935","Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011 Miranda, Ana Catarina/D-4742-2009",NA,452,638,281,"#000000",NA,""

High temporal repeatability and contextual consistency in all these traits indicated they reflected personality. In addition, Principal Component Analysis revealed two independent syndromes, labeled exploration-persistence and boldness. We found no sex or rank differences in the trait scores, but the scores declined with age. Nonetheless, there was considerable inter-individual variation within age-classes, suggesting that behavior was not merely determined by age but also by dispositional effects. In conclusion, our study complements earlier rating studies and adds new traits to the chimpanzee personality, thereby supporting the existence of multiple personality traits among chimpanzees. We stress the importance of ecologically valid behavioral research to assess multiple personality traits and their association, as it allows inclusion of ape studies in the comparison of personality structures across species studied behaviorally, and furthers our attempts to unravel the causes and consequences of animal personality.

Recently, the DSM-5 Levels of Personality Functioning Scale has moved it into the focus of psychiatric diagnostics. Based on Kernberg's concept of personality organization the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) was developed for diagnosing personality functioning. The STIPO covers seven dimensions: (1) identity, (2) object relations, (3) primitive defenses, (4) coping/rigidity, (5) aggression, (6) moral values, and (7) reality testing and perceptual distortions. The English version of the STIPO has previously revealed satisfying psychometric properties. Methods: Validity and reliability of the German version of the 100-item instrument have been evaluated in 122 psychiatric patients. All patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and were assessed by means of the STIPO. Moreover, all patients completed eight questionnaires that served as criteria for external validity of the STIPO. Results: Interrater reliability varied between intraclass correlations of .89 and 1.0, Crohnbach's a for the seven dimensions was .69 to .93. All a priori selected questionnaire scales correlated significantly with the corresponding STIPO dimensions. Patients with personality disorder (PD) revealed significantly higher STIPO scores (i.e. worse personality functioning) than patients without PD; patients cluster B PD showed significantly higher STIPO scores than patients with cluster C PD.

Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.","10.1098/rspb.2013.1019","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000320649400013","20131019","Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458",NA,NA,455,386,487,"#000000",NA,""

The aggressive spillover hypothesis' (ASH) posits that pre-copulatory cannibalism represents a spillover of female aggressiveness from the juvenile foraging context, when aggressiveness is advantageous, to the adult mating context, when aggressiveness may be non-adaptive or maladaptive. The ASH suggests that individuals exhibit limited plasticity in aggressive behaviours because they are genetically canalised for indiscriminate aggressiveness towards prey and conspecifics, including males. Hence, a tendency to employ pre-copulatory cannibalism is a part of the female aggression syndrome, an assertion generally accepted in the personality field. We here re-evaluate the previous findings in the light of personality criteria, which we propose for ASH validation: between-individual differences, repeatability and heritability in tendency for pre-copulatory attacks (and pre-copulatory cannibalism) and voracity towards prey, and their correlation. To re-evaluate ASH and to allow for additional or alternative explanations, we ask whether pre-copulatory cannibalism depends on female hunger, mating status, size and/or male quality. Finally, we ask whether cannibalistic females have a reduced reproductive success as predicted by the ASH. While repeatability and heritability in voracity towards prey and its correlation with the tendency to engage in pre-copulatory cannibalism were found in certain systems, we lack any evidence for repeatability and heritability in pre-copulatory cannibalistic attempts and for its maladaptiveness. Rather than only resorting to the ASH, foraging and mate choice hypotheses may also explain pre-copulatory cannibalism. We suggest clarifying the use of the terms sexual cannibalism (effect) and female aggressiveness or tendency to attack and devour males (cause), and argue that male strategies to avoid cannibalism should be considered. We propose testing the ASH as the explanation for pre-copulatory cannibalism in those cases where female tendency to devour males correlates with actual pre-copulatory cannibalism and when all the above criteria are fulfilled. Finally, we propose future directions for studying the ASH.","10.1111/eth.12111","0179-1613","1439-0310","ISI:000325854800001",NA,"Schneider, Jutta/0000-0001-8523-7354","Schneider, Jutta/G-3727-2010",NA,456,105,200,"#000000",NA,""

First, we tested whether S. sarasinorum show stable individual differences in behaviour (i.e. individual personalities) and whether aspects of individuals' behaviour are correlated across contexts, in the form of a behavioural syndrome. As documented in many other animals, S. sarasinorum showed stable individual differences in behaviour that were repeatable across time, and correlated across contexts (i.e. aggressiveness, boldness). Second, we tested for and confirmed the presence of consistent intercolony variation (i.e. colony-level personalities) in collective foraging behaviour. Third, we generated artificially reconstituted colonies of known group size and personality composition to test for associations between colonies' personality composition and their collective foraging behaviour. In experimental colonies, we found that the average phenotypes of colony constituents were associated with colony-level behaviour, where colonies composed of smaller and bolder spiders were more responsive during foraging. However, the single best predictor of colony-level behaviour was the behavioural type of the single most extreme individual, where the boldness score of boldest individuals explained 66-69\% of the variation in colony-level behaviour. Together, our results suggest that variation in the personality composition of social groups may be an important driver of variation in colony-level personality.

Additionally, the aim was to determine whether any consistent correlations between these behavioural traits, known as behavioural syndromes, were present in the study population. The results revealed that all three personality traits were highly repeatable over time in both sexes. Evidence of a complex syndrome in the form of a correlation between boldness, sociability and activity was found; however, this relationship was only present in males. Males that were more active in a familiar environment emerged more quickly from shelter into a novel environment and were more social. In general, male P. reticulata were bold, active and antisocial compared to females, with these differences probably a reflection of opposing life-history strategies. Only a weak link between the strength of cerebral lateralisation and personality was discovered and this was mediated by sex.

In ectotherms, functional integration of locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of the potential for coadaptation among these traits. For this reason, we analyzed interindividual variation, covariation, and repeatability of the thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed, preferred body temperature, thermal precision, and resting metabolic rate measured in ca. 200 common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) that varied by sex, age, and body size. We found significant interindividual variation in selected body temperatures and in the thermal performance curve of maximal sprint speed for both the intercept (expected trait value at the average temperature) and the slope (measure of thermal sensitivity). Interindividual differences in maximal sprint speed across temperatures, preferred body temperature, and thermal precision were significantly repeatable. A positive relationship existed between preferred body temperature and thermal precision, implying that individuals selecting higher temperatures were more precise. The resting metabolic rate was highly variable but was not related to thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed or thermal behavior. Thus, locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism were not directly functionally linked in the common lizard.","10.1086/671376","1522-2152",NA,"ISI:000320877400008",NA,NA,NA,NA,462,329,616,"#000000",NA,""

If so, then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here, we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were also detected. A single vector explains 80 \% of the among-individual variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness. We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through impacts on resource acquisition.","10.1007/s00265-013-1540-7","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000320024200012",NA,"Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051","Wilson, Alastair/F-3118-2010 ",NA,464,104,158,"#000000",NA,""

Animal personality has recently been integrated into the pace-of-life-syndrome hypothesis, relating individual behavioural traits to life history. Variation in cognitive traits could be explained well by this theoretical framework. A risk-reward trade-off might lead to different cognitive types: Active birds that learn fast, take risks and probably have a fast lifestyle and less active, slow learning birds that are risk averse but thereby perform better in reversal learning as they probably pay more attention to external cues. We investigated the performance of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in a cognitively challenging reversal learning task and linked this to two personality traits: activity and fearfulness. Male birds were better in reversal learning than females. While no personality-related differences occurred in the initial learning of our task, more active and fearful birds relearned the cue-reward association faster. While birds of different sex might have revealed different risk-taking strategies in the training, our findings do not reveal the expected direction of a risk-reward trade-off in the reversal learning. It seems likely that a more general and personality-related cognitive ability might improve performance across different tasks. The linkage between personality and cognition documented here could hence suggest that cognitive traits are indeed part of an overall pace-of-life syndrome.","10.1111/eth.12095","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000320134600003",NA,NA,NA,NA,465,71,310,"#000000",NA,""

The coping style model provides a set of predictions about correlations between behavioural and neurophysiological reactions to a stressful situation. According to this model, high levels of activity should be correlated with high levels of aggressiveness at the behavioural level, and to high sympathetic reactivity, low parasympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate levels) and low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis reactivity (low production of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor). More recent versions of the model, however, are challenging this view and consider the possibility of independent axes of coping style and stress reactivity. The coping style model has mainly been tested on artificially selected or inbred lines in laboratory settings. Such a situation restricts its generalization to a larger number of species and there is a need for studies testing it in the wild under more natural situations. Here, we test the predictions of the coping style model in a wild alpine marmot, Marmota marmota, population. We show that several behavioural (i.e. exploration in an open field, impulsivity and docility) and neurophysiological traits (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate and cortisol production) assumed to represent individual differences in coping style were significantly repeatable over 2-3 years. Not all the correlations between traits predicted by the coping style model were found in marmots, which supports the more recent two-axes model. Furthermore, most correlations were observed at the between-individual level, and the within-individual correlations (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) were weaker. Overall, our results support the prediction of the coping style model, but highlight the fact that the association between traits found in artificial conditions may be weaker in a more natural setting.

However, individual differences in behaviors relating to this conflict have not been fully explored. Three experiments with two test repeats 1-3 days apart were conducted using 8-16 Japanese Black cows at intervals of approximately 3 weeks between Experiments 1 and 2 and 1 year between Experiments 2 and 3. Individual cows were tested in a grassed arena (85 m x 30 m in Experiments 1 and 2, 130 m x 18 m in Experiment 3) with an adjoining group pen holding the peers. Plastic washtubs (16 in Experiments 1 and 2,25 in Experiment 3) containing 150 g grain-based concentrate were placed at 5 m increments on the centerline of the arena to entice test cows away from the group. Behavior of test cows were recorded for 30 min as: maximum (D-max) and mean (D-mean) distance from the group, number of total (N-total) and different (N-diff) tub visits, and proportion of time eating concentrate (P-eatconc) and grazing sward (P-graze). Cows showed consistency in D-max, D-mean, N-total and N-diff over the short periods of 1-3 days (repeatability within experiments = 0.41-0.80) and approximately 3 weeks (Pearson r between Experiments 1 and 2 = 0.81-0.91, P < 0.05). Cows were further consistent in D-max, N-total and N-diff over the extended period of 1 year (Pearson r between Experiments 2 and 3 and between Experiments 1 and 3 = 0.68-0.93, P < 0.05). By contrast, P-eatconc and P-graze showed poorer consistency within cows, giving low repeatability estimates (0.29-0.34) in Experiment 2 and low Pearson r between Experiments 2 and 3 (0.30-0.31,P > 0.05). It was concluded that D-max, N-total and N-diff provide a reliable measure of the propensity for individual cows to trade sociability for feeding when the test is repeated over both short and extended periods. A test arena longer than 130 m would be necessary for fully discriminating individual behavioral traits of cattle. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

During fall 2009, we manipulated a large flock of cowbirds in a fissionfusion perturbation and recorded the frequency of head-downs and social approaches. During the fissionfusion perturbation, the rate of head-downs remained both correlated and repeatable across perturbations. In spring 2010, we separated individuals into three aviaries, a high, intermediate, and low aviary, based on the frequency of head-down displays they initiated during the previous fall 2009. When breeding, males in the high flock produced a higher number of songs within counter-singing matches, and females laid more eggs in comparison with the other aviaries.

However, no study has yet examined whether a bird's ability to discriminate between humans is related to the bird's underlying behavioural type. In this study, we examined whether there were differences among North Island (NI) robins (Petroica longipes), based on their underlying behavioural type, in their abilities to discriminate between familiar and novel human observers. Using a simple feeding experiment, we timed how long it took birds to attack a food item placed next to an observer on each of 7 days. On the eighth day, a different observer timed the birds. We found that birds could be split into two behaviour types based on their attack behaviour: fast attackers (latencies <20 sec) and slow attackers (latencies >20 secs). Interestingly, the fast birds did not increase their attack latency in response to the novel observer whereas the slow attackers did. This result, for the first time, demonstrates that a bird's ability to discriminate between humans can vary among birds based on their behavioural type.","10.1371/journal.pone.0064487","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000319966400058","e64487","Chevallier, Clement/0000-0002-0956-5978 Burns, K.C./0000-0002-4938-2877 Barnett, Craig/0000-0001-5941-8370",NA,NA,471,581,514,"#000000",NA,""

However, the reliability of this measure among individuals who abuse substances has not yet been well examined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of this measure in abstinent, opioid-dependent participants. Methods: The opioid-dependent participants were all male inmates recruited from two official correction agencies located in northern Taiwan, from October 2006 to September 2007; of these participants, the retest group completed a second assessment after 1 month. The internal consistency reliability of the BIS version 11 (BIS-11) was assessed by calculating the Cronbach alpha coefficient. Test-retest reliability was assessed based on intraclass correlation coefficients. Factor validity was examined using principal component analysis. Internal consistency and factor validity of the BIS-11 were investigated in a sample of 153 participants, and test-retest reliability was analyzed in 67 participants. Results: A three-factor structure of BIS-11 representing psychological constructs similar to those originally identified in other translations of the BIS-11 was found. The Cronbach a coefficient for this instrument was 0.83, indicating high internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.66, indicating good test-retest reliability. The BIS-11 had highest reliability among participants without a criminal history. The test retest reliability was still satisfactory among participants with a lower education level or alcohol dependence. Conclusion: This study suggests that the Chinese version of the BIS-11 is a reliable measure and has potential utility for investigating impulsivity in opioid-dependent individuals.

To date our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning consistent individual differences in behaviour (also termed behavioural types (BTs)) remains limited. Theoretical work suggests life-history tradeoffs drive BT variation, however, empirical support is scarce. Moreover, whilst life-history is known to be phenotypically plastic in response to environmental conditions during ontogeny, the extent to which such plasticity drives plasticity in behavioural traits and personality remains poorly understood. Using a natural clonal vertebrate, Kryptolebias marmoratus, we control for genetic variation and investigate developmental plasticity in life-history and three commonly studied behavioural traits (exploration, boldness, aggression) in response to three ecologically relevant environments; conspecific presence, low food and perceived risk. Simulated predation risk was the only treatment that generated repeatable behaviour i.e. personality during ontogeny. Treatments differed in their effects on mean life-history and behavioural scores. Specifically, low food fish exhibited reduced growth rate and exploration but did not differ from control fish in their boldness or aggression scores. Conspecific presence resulted in a strong negative effect on mean aggression, boldness and exploration during ontogeny but had minimal effect on life-history traits. Simulated predation risk resulted in increased reproductive output but had minimal effect upon average behavioural scores. Together these results suggest that life-history plasticity/variation may be insufficient in driving variation in personality during development. Finally, using offspring derived from each rearing environment we investigate maternal effects and find strong maternal influence upon offspring size, but not behaviour. These results highlight and support the current understanding that risk perception is important in shaping personality, and that social experience during ontogeny is a major influence upon behavioural expression.","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20556.x","0030-1299",NA,"ISI:000317981400004",NA,"Croft, Darren/0000-0001-6869-5097 Edenbrow, Mathew/0000-0002-3318-6337","Croft, Darren/B-5503-2009 Edenbrow, Mathew/K-3331-2013",NA,473,212,277,"#000000",NA,""

Within-individual variance could exist because of responses to variable environments (plasticity) or because exhibiting variance per se has fitness consequences. To evolve, the latter requires between-individual variance in within-individual variance. Here, we investigate the parental behavior of female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and assess if the distribution of within-individual variance also differs between individuals or changes with respect to environmental conditions. We used a statistical approach that models both the mean and variance iteratively. We found that the amount of food delivered per second on each visit was influenced by female identity, nestling age, and the location (on vs. off territory) where the female foraged. Moreover, we also found that unexplained within-individual variance (residual variance), after controlling for mean effects, independently declined with nestling age and was smaller when females foraged off their mate's territory. In addition, females differed in residual variance more than expected by chance. These results confirm that phenotypic variance has a hierarchical structure and they support preconditions for the evolution of mean phenotypic values as well as the variance in phenotype. In the case of provisioning as a form of parental care, our data suggest that female red-winged blackbirds could be managing stochastic variance either directly through choice of foraging location or indirectly in how they budget their time, and we discuss these patterns in relation to adaptive variance sensitivity.","10.1093/beheco/ars207","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000317320100008",NA,"Schofield, Matthew/0000-0003-1481-2766",NA,NA,474,385,220,"#000000",NA,""

Activity was found to be repeatable both within and across seasonal contexts, but escape time and neophobia-related behavior were repeatable only in winter. Our RRPM confirmed that this latter finding was due to crossing of the individual-specific reaction norms between the 2 seasonal contexts. Our work illustrates how a behavior measured in a standardized manner may or may not be repeatable across time within a context but not between contexts, depending on the interindividual variation in reaction-norm properties.

However, the effectiveness of selection acting on any one signal type may depend on selective forces acting on the same characteristics in other signal types, particularly if the signals share a common physical production mechanism. In anurans, signal variability has been related to the potential for various forms of selection by female choice on the characteristics of male advertisement calls. The significance of variability in the characteristics of another vocalization type, the aggressive call, is less well understood. In the present stiudy, within- and between-male variability was measured in several characteristics of both advertisement and aggressive calls in the treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus. Many characteristics of both call types were repeatable within males. Fine-temporal and spectral characteristics generally had low variation within males, whereas gross-temporal characteristics were more variable. Unexpectedly, there were strong correlations between both measures of variability and mean values of the call characteristics of advertisement and aggressive calls. Thus, despite potentially conflicting selection pressures acting on advertisement and aggressive calls, the characteristics of individuals' calls were consistent across these two signal types. The potential forces responsible for consistency across call types are discussed, including morphological constraints and behavioural syndromes that act across different signalling contexts. In general, it is argued that measurements of variability made across multiple signal types, as in the present study, can provide important insights into the evolution of signal structure in organisms with complex signal repertoires.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 131145.","10.1111/bij.12028","0024-4066","1095-8312","ISI:000317354800011",NA,"Reichert, Michael/0000-0002-0159-4387","Reichert, Michael/A-5034-2010",NA,476,391,17,"#405d99","selected",""

Until recently, the ecological and social circumstances influencing the developing phenotype have not been investigated in much detail. Nevertheless, they represent an important step in niche construction by which the developing organism can in principle adjust to predictable aspects of its life history. By dynamically changing photoperiod during gestation, we tested how behavioral phenotypes (BPs) and physiology of juvenile cavies (Cavia aperea) adjust to seasonal differences in prenatal photoperiod. The prenatal photoperiod, simulating spring or autumn, led to faster or slower maturation in females but the relative size rank in litter also exerted a major influence on the onset of maturation. In addition, prenatal photoperiod strongly influenced BP and stress response in juvenile animals. Heavy females born into autumn developed a less explorative, more shy BP, whereas heavy females born into spring produced more explorative, bolder BP. Smaller sisters did not differ in the onset of maturation and, correspondingly, we found no differences in the BP. We did not find differences in the BP in males also. Early personality traits, though repeatable, changed over ontogeny to such an extent that early group differences in BP had completely disappeared in adults. Our results indicate high developmental plasticity with respect to predicted optimal life history and suggest long-term plasticity in response to photoperiod.","10.1093/beheco/ars177","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000317472000017",NA,NA,NA,NA,477,443,261,"#000000",NA,""

The aim of this paper was to analyse shot types to determine the extent to which they are played in different court areas and a more detailed analysis to determine whether the time available had an influence on the shot selected. Ten elite matches, contested by fifteen of the world's top right handed squash players (age 27 +/- 3.2, height 1.81 +/- 0.06 m, weight 76.3 +/- 3.7 kg), at the men's World Team Championships were processed using the SAGIT/Squash tracking system with shot information manually added to the system. Results suggested that shot responses were dependent upon court location and the time between shots. When these factors were considered repeatable performance existed to the extent that one of two shots was typically played when there was limited time to play the shot (< 1.20s). For example, it was clear that when players did not have a lot of time to hit the ball (low time i.e. < 1.06s, and mid time i.e. 1.06 - 1.20s) in the front left corner close to the side wall, the crosscourt lob was used frequently (44.30\% and 36.31\% respectively) whereas when there was more time this shot was seldom used (13.64\%). Consequently variant and invariant behaviour were shown to exist in elite squash although for the first time it was suggested that the availability of time to play a shot contributed to which of these behaviours was evident.

One particularly important topic in this context is how individuals' variation in behaviour shapes group-level characteristics. We investigated how fish that express different locomotory behaviour in an asocial context move collectively when in groups. First, we established that individual fish have characteristic, repeatable locomotion behaviours (i.e. median speeds, variance in speeds and median turning speeds) when tested on their own. When tested in groups of two, four or eight fish, we found individuals partly maintained their asocial median speed and median turning speed preferences, while their variance in speed preference was lost. The strength of this individuality decreased as group size increased, with individuals conforming to the speed of the group, while also decreasing the variability in their own speed. Further, individuals adopted movement characteristics that were dependent on what group size they were in. This study therefore shows the influence of social context on individual behaviour. If the results found here can be generalized across species and contexts, then although individuality is not entirely lost in groups, social conformity and group-size-dependent effects drive how individuals will adjust their behaviour in groups.","10.1098/rspb.2012.2564","0962-8452","1471-2954","ISI:000312591600018","20122564","Krause, Jens/0000-0002-1289-2857 Schaerf, Timothy/0000-0001-6642-8374 Morrell, Lesley/0000-0003-0256-7871 Ward, Ashley/0000-0003-0842-533X Herbert-Read, James/0000-0003-0243-4518","Krause, Jens/J-4381-2013 Schaerf, Timothy/M-7821-2015 Ward, Ashley/B-6227-2011 Morrell, Lesley/A-4311-2008 ",NA,481,618,562,"#000000",NA,""

However, the psychometric properties of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire in common musculoskeletal disorders like acute low back pain have not been adequately studied. Patients' perceptions vary across different populations and affect coping styles. Thus, our aim was to determine the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity of the Dutch language version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire in acute non-specific low back pain patients in primary care physical therapy. Methods: A non-experimental cross-sectional study with two measurements was performed. Eighty-four acute low back pain patients, in multidisciplinary health care center in Dutch primary care with a sample mean (SD) age of 42 (12) years, participated in the study. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest procedures (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients and limits of agreement) were evaluated at a one-week interval. The concurrent validity of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire was examined by using the Mental Health Component of the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Results: The Cronbach's a for internal consistency was 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.67 - 0.83); and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient test-retest reliability was acceptable: 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.53 - 0.82), however, the limits of agreement were large. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient measuring concurrent validity 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.46 - 0.80). Conclusion: The Dutch version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire is an appropriate instrument for measuring patients' perceptions in acute low back pain patients, showing acceptable internal consistency and reliability.

We tested this hypothesis in the wild using free-ranging great tits. Personality variation was quantified using exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, which has previously been shown to be repeatable and correlated with other behaviours in this and other populations of the same species. By temporarily removing food at feeding stations we examined whether birds with different personality differed in returning to visit empty feeders as this may provide information on how birds continue to sample their environment after a sudden change in conditions. In two summer experiments, we found that fast-exploring juveniles visited empty feeders less often compared to slow-exploring juveniles. In winter, sampling behaviour was sex dependent but not related to personality. In both seasons, we found that birds who sampled empty feeders more often were more likely to rediscover food after we again re-baited the feeding stations, but there was no effect of personality. Our results show that personality types may indeed differ in ways of collecting environmental information, which is consistent with the view of personalities as different styles of coping with environmental changes.

However, whether these responses can be shaped by immediate recent aggressive experience is unknown. In this study, males first were presented with paired dummy male and female conspecifics after they had been isolated to obtain a baseline, no-experience measure. Males then won and lost fights and were retested with the dummies after each fight. These three experience types (no, win, loss) occurred both when males did and did not have nests to determine the effects of nest presence, experience, and the interaction between these factors on behavioral consistency. Overall behavior did not change based on experience with the exception of male-directed tail beats. Repeatability values were affected more by having a nest than fight outcome.

To examine these questions, juvenile and adult male Siamese fighting fish were presented with a dummy male and dummy female simultaneously both before and after acute exposure to a nominal (15 ng/L) dose of EE2. Multiple trials were conducted to measure how consistent individual differences are affected by age and EE2 exposure. Both female- and male-directed behaviors decreased after short-term exposure to EE2. Juvenile and adult fish differed in the number of female-directed tail beats and bites they performed, with adult fish performing more tail beats and juvenile fish performing more bites. EE2 exposure had a greater effect on consistent individual differences in female-directed than in male-directed behaviors, which may be a byproduct of intense artificial selection for aggression in this species. Repeatability values were lower both before and after exposure in juvenile than in adult fish, suggesting that individuals become more consistent with age. This study suggests that male Siamese fighting fish vary in their sensitivity to short-term EE2 exposure and stresses the importance of examining behavior over multiple time points both within and across age classes to gain a more thorough understanding of the effects of endocrine disruptors on behavior.","10.1007/s00244-012-9820-1","0090-4341",NA,"ISI:000314040800016",NA,"Dzieweczynski, Teresa/0000-0002-5182-9914",NA,NA,486,586,407,"#000000",NA,""

Spatial properties of individual localization behavior can be represented in the form of perceptual maps. Individual differences in these maps may reflect properties of internal body representations, and perceptual maps may therefore be a useful method for studying these representations. For this to be the case, individual perceptual maps need to be reproducible, which has not yet been demonstrated. We assessed the reproducibility of localizations measured twice on subsequent days. Ten subjects participated in the experiments. Non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli were applied at seven sites on the lower arm. Subjects localized the stimuli on a photograph of their own arm, which was presented on a tablet screen overlaying the real arm. Reproducibility was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the mean localizations of each electrode site and the slope and offset of regression models of the localizations, which represent scaling and displacement of perceptual maps relative to the stimulated sites. The ICCs of the mean localizations ranged from 0.68 to 0.93; the ICCs of the regression parameters were 0.88 for the intercept and 0.92 for the slope. These results indicate a high degree of reproducibility. We conclude that localization patterns of non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli on the arm are reproducible on subsequent days. Reproducibility is a necessary property of perceptual maps for these to reflect properties of a subject's internal body representations.

For example, consistent behavioral traits can affect trappability/catchability, independent of obvious factors such as size and gender, and these traits are often correlated with other repeatable physiological and/or life history traits. If so, systematic sampling bias may exist for any of these traits. The extent to which this is a problem, of course, depends on the magnitude of bias, which is presently unknown because the underlying trait distributions in populations are usually unknown, or unknowable. Indeed, our present knowledge about sampling bias comes from samples (not complete population censuses), which can possess bias to begin with. I had the unique opportunity to create naturalized populations of fish by seeding each of four small fishless lakes with equal densities of slow-, intermediate-, and fast-growing fish. Using sampling methods that are not size-selective, I observed that fast-growing fish were up to two-times more likely to be sampled than slower-growing fish. This indicates substantial and systematic bias with respect to an important life history trait (growth rate). If correlations between behavioral, physiological and life-history traits are as widespread as the literature suggests, then many animal samples may be systematically biased with respect to these traits (e.g., when collecting animals for laboratory use), and affect our inferences about population structure and abundance. I conclude with a discussion on ways to minimize sampling bias for particular physiological/behavioral/life-history types within animal populations.","10.1007/s00442-012-2426-5","0029-8549",NA,"ISI:000313800600004",NA,NA,"Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009",NA,488,47,570,"#000000",NA,""

Being able to produce a wide range of variants of one kind of behavior, e.g., a very short and a very long response time to a stimulus under different environmental conditions, can be described as behavioral plasticity. How such behavioral reaction norms develop for individuals is poorly understood, but several factors are likely to play a role. We investigated what factors may affect how the risk-taking behavior of the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, is shaped during ontogeny. We manipulated larval density to represent the potential intensity of future competition for females in a lek of males, determined adult moths' reaction to predator signals, and tested for plasticity in the silence response, i.e., the acoustic evasion behavior of the moths during the experiments. While we found no effect of larval density on either the probability or the duration of the silence response, 11 \% of the variance in duration could be explained by differences between families, and 30 \% of the variance was the result of differences between individuals. We found evidence for habituation to the predator signal, clearly indicating that the silence response is a plastic-enough trait to be adjustable to the immediate environment. These results suggest that the degree to which individuals take risks in the context of acoustic signaling depends more on the immediate context and, possibly, genetic differentiation than it is a product of adaptive developmental plasticity.","10.1007/s00265-012-1445-x","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000313650600009",NA,NA,NA,NA,489,514,591,"#000000",NA,""

Based on differential allocation theory that predicts biased reproductive investment of females depending on the attractiveness of mates, a number of previous studies have shown that egg production is related in various ways to ornamental sexual traits of males, but evidence for behavioural sexual traits is less abundant. In this study we examine such maternal effects in relation to birdsong. Because the Bengalese finch is a monomorphic songbird, courtship song serves a key role in mate choice. To take into account individual female differences in egg production performance, we sequentially paired naive, captive, female Bengalese finches to two different males, and investigated if their reproductive investment (clutch size, egg mass and hatchling sex ratio) was related to the song traits of their mates. We found that clutch size and egg mass were highly repeatable within individual females while sex ratio was not. Despite the inflexibility of egg mass within each female, egg mass increased when females were mated to males with longer songs. In addition, we found a non-significant weak tendency toward male-biased sex ratio in relation to longer song duration of mates. Our findings suggest that females mated to better mates adjusted their reproductive investment by producing heavier eggs and possibly offspring of the more costly sex.","10.1163/1568539X-00003106","0005-7959",NA,"ISI:000324476100001",NA,NA,NA,NA,492,169,234,"#000000",NA,""

Squeeze chute exit velocity was obtained for 1,181 crossbred yearling steers using ES and FS temperament systems. Flight speed used infrared sensors to determine the time taken for an animal to traverse a fixed distance of 1.83 m after exiting the squeeze chute. Exit score (1 = walk, 2 = trot, 3 = canter, and 4 = run) was assigned by 2 different observers when each steer crossed a fixed point between the infrared sensors. All animals were scored with each system (ES and FS) simultaneously on exiting the squeeze chute on d -21 and d -1 of the experiment. Of the 1,181 cattle, 357 were moved to a nearby research feedyard for use in a 140 d feedlot trial. These cattle were scored using both measurement systems and BW was recorded at 35 d intervals throughout the trial. Exit score was assessed for observer reliability, ES and FS were compared for measurement repeat-ability, and both were assessed on ability to predict ADG. Exit score between observers on a single day showed considerable agreement (weighted Kappa = 0.66), indicating the system was reliable between different observers. However, the agreement for a single observer between day was only moderate (weighted Kappa = 0.40), indicating a day effect for ES. In addition, although mean velocities for day were not different (P > 0.18; FS = 2.98 +/- .87 and 3.02 +/- 0.87 m/s for day, respectively), the persistence of FS for each animal was low (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.25). The frequency that an animal would be placed into the same third of FS or receive the same ES on consecutive weigh days was 50\% and 60.0\%, respectively, and both were moderate predictors of ADG (R-2 = 0.14 and R-2 = 0.17). These data indicate that ES and FS are reliable instruments for assessment of temperament on a given day, and show moderate repeatability across days.

However, at present relatively few studies present such data, and few consider how changing abiotic conditions affect behavioural plasticity. Individual differences in metabolic rate have been suggested as a proximate mechanism promoting personality, leading one to speculate that individual differences in metabolic sensitivity to temperature may affect behavioural responses in ectotherms. At present, only one study (out of two) has tested for and shown individual differences in behavioural responses to temperature. Here, we repeatedly assayed the behaviour of a marine crab across a narrow range of temperatures to test for individual differences in responses to temperature. We observed large inter-individual differences in behaviour that were consistent over time at a given temperature (evidence for personality), and individual differences in responses to temperature (evidence for plasticity). This study adds to the very scant literature on ectotherm behavioural sensitivity to temperature, and suggests the phenomenon might be widespread. We speculate about the role of metabolism as a proximate mechanism that might explain these individual differences in plasticity and make suggestions for future research to test this hypothesis.","10.1163/1568539X-00003081","0005-7959",NA,"ISI:000318663500005",NA,NA,"Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009",NA,494,409,539,"#000000",NA,""

This study aimed to validate the use of a remote low power (165 mW) carbon dioxide laser device for the assessment of thermal nociceptive thresholds in cats. Repeatabilites were established based on individual responses to three thermal tests on the same day and across 4 consecutive days. A total of 12 thermal tests were conducted on each of eight male and eight female de-sexed adult cats. As a control a non-thermal helium aiming laser was used to ensure the animals were responding to the thermal component of the device. All thermal tests elicited a behavioural response with the large majority being a skin twitch known as the panniculus reflex (97\%). None of the non-thermal tests resulted in this reflex behaviour. There was no evidence that cats became sensitised or habituated to the low power thermal stimulus on any given day (P=0.426) or across days (P=0.115), or that there was any interaction between the two time factors (P=0.084). There was also no difference in latency to respond between males and females (P=0.094), although there was a significant interaction between the day of testing and the sex of the subject (P=0.042). Significant intra-class correlations demonstrated that individual responses were repeatable over days 1-3 (all P<0.05) but not over day 4 (P=0.096). A significant intra-class correlation was also evident across all days when data were combined (P<0.0001). This technique shows some promise in assessing individual nociceptive thresholds and as a tool to establish associated individual differences. It could, with more exploration, also provide an alternative thermal mechanism for testing the efficacy of analgesics in cats. The significant repeatabilities were low ranging from 0.241 to 0.414, this suggests that a number of extraneous factors may have influenced responses to CO2 laser stimulation at low power levels (165 mW). Further exploration of this technique on a larger sample than used here may allow elucidation of any other factors, including age or sex effects, that impact upon thermal sensitivity in the domestic cat.

The BPSC is modeled after the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) and is part of the Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children, a comprehensive, freely available screening instrument designed for use in pediatric primary care. METHOD: BPSC items were developed by a team of experts who reviewed existing assessment instruments and relevant research literature. Scale construction and initial validation were conducted with 205 families from pediatric primary care sites and 54 families from referral clinics. A replication sample of 146 additional families were enrolled from an independent set of primary care practices. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed 3 dimensions of the BPSC: irritability, inflexibility, and difficulty with routines. Factor structure was confirmed in the replication sample. Retest reliability and internal reliability were adequate (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.70) across subscales, with the exception of the ``irritability{''} subscale's internal reliability in the replication sample. Construct validity of the ``irritability{''} and the ``difficulty with routines{''} subscales is supported by correlations with the Parenting Stress Index and the Ages \& Stages Questionnaire: Social/Emotional, but the ``inflexibility{''} subscale seems to be distinct from performance on these instruments.

Network analysis offers a valuable opportunity to characterize individual consistency of traits in labile social groups and therein provide novel insights to personality research in ways previously not possible using traditional techniques. Should individual network positions be consistently different between individuals under changing conditions, they might reflect expressions of an individual's personality. Here, we discuss a conceptual framework for using network analyses to infer the presence of individual differences and present a statistical test based on randomization techniques for testing the consistency of network positions in individuals. The statistical tools presented are useful because if particular individuals consistently occupy key positions in social networks, then this is also likely to have consequences for their fitness as well as for that of others in the population. These consequences may be particularly significant since individual network position has been shown to be important for the transmission of diseases, socially learnt information and genetic material between individuals and populations.","10.1007/s00265-012-1428-y","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000313060500016",NA,"Wilson, Alexander/0000-0002-7696-1671","Wilson, Alexander/B-3329-2011",NA,498,373,499,"#000000",NA,""

Recently (Herczeg and Garamszegi Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66:161-169, 2012), we introduced the concept of syndrome deviation that allows the study of behavioural syndromes at the individual level by focusing on the individual deviation from the hypothetical perfect group-level behavioural correlation. Subsequently, Dingemanse et al. (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66:1543-1548, 2012) emphasized that behavioural syndromes refer to the between-individual component of phenotypic correlations, and only this component is relevant for syndrome deviation. They also recommended mixed models to decompose the between- and within-individual correlations. We agree that separating these components is important, but the proposed approach is impractical to apply for functionally different behaviours because (1) the assumption of constant within-individual correlations is unjustified and (2) different behaviours cannot be measured at the same time. Further, our simulations based on mixed models show that the statistical differentiation between the within- and between-individual components is inefficient when using realistic sample sizes. Until the separation of between- and within-individual correlations is resolved, we recommend alternative approaches for empirical behavioural syndrome research that consider the repeatability of the behaviours and the optimal balance between within- and between-individual sample sizes. Syndrome deviation calculated from phenotypic correlations of traits that are proven to be individual specific, or from the between-individual correlations if possible, is a meaningful metric to describe behavioural consistency and to explain its evolutionary significance.","10.1007/s00265-012-1439-8","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000310991600011",NA,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011",NA,499,83,229,"#000000",NA,""

However, despite numerous theoretical explanations there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour. However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test. Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity, physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment matching.","10.1371/journal.pone.0049598","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000311885300056","e49598","pomeroy, patrick/0000-0003-1603-5630",NA,NA,500,645,30,"#405d99","selected","Pup checking behaviour"

The amount of risk animals take for a given resource depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between individuals of different personality types. We tested whether individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment, we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites. During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk. Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using optimality approaches.

The decisions where to settle and how far to travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g. specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set. Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females, would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females. Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness, helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival. However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We used the specific testing situations within these manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods, and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

One of the main drivers of the genesis and maintenance of biodiversity is mobility, i.e. the net result of the interaction between physiological performances (movement capacity) and behavioural decisions (movement decisions). Although several previous studies have found personality traits related to mobility, it is not yet clear whether mobility involves a real syndrome, i.e. whether individuals showing good movement capacity are also more likely to decide to move, and whether these inter-individual differences are consistent across time. 2. The aim of the present study was therefore to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of inter-individual variation in mobility by measuring three traits related to mobility under experimental conditions in a butterfly species, and to test the existence of correlations between these traits. These measures implied movement capacity and movement decision. 3. It was shown that mobility-related traits were (i) consistent across time, (ii) inter-correlated, and (iii) dependent upon sex and morphology. 4. These results therefore suggest the existence of a mobility syndrome in a butterfly. Such findings highlight the necessity to accurately integrate inter-individual variation (behavioural syndrome) in our comprehension of the evolution of movement strategies.","10.1111/j.1365-2311.2012.01375.x","0307-6946",NA,"ISI:000308636400007",NA,"Legrand, Delphine/0000-0002-5186-2909 Ducatez, Simon/0000-0003-2865-4674","Legrand, Delphine/N-4575-2014 ",NA,506,327,2,"#405d99","selected",""

In the present study, we examined the short- and long-term repeatability and stability of two unrelated personality traits exploratory tendencies and struggling rate using captive female zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that, overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were repeatable in the long term. We found interindividual differences in short-term stability of exploratory tendencies, but not struggling rate, providing evidence for differences in intraindividual variability. In the long term, struggling rate significantly decreased between the two experimental sessions, whereas exploratory tendencies remained stable. Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both sessions did not differ. Our results suggest that short- and long-term repeatability and stability of personality may vary between individuals, depending on the behavioural trait under scrutiny. As a consequence, deducing personality from measures realized earlier in a subject's life should be performed with caution.

Such phenomenon is labelled as behavioural syndrome and is usually demonstrated by phenotypic correlations between behaviours like activity, exploration, aggression and risk-taking across individuals in a population. However, published studies disagree on the strength, and even on the existence of such relationships. To make general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed the literature using modern meta-analytic approaches. Based on a large dataset, we investigated the overall relationship between behaviours that are expected to form a syndrome and tested which factors can mediate heterogeneities in study outcomes. The average strength of the phenotypic correlation between behaviours was weak; we found no effect of the phylogeny of species but did observe significant publication bias. However, even accounting for this bias, the mean effect size was positive and statistically different from zero (r = 0.198). Effect sizes showed considerable heterogeneity within species, implying a role for population-specific adaptation to environmental factors and/or between-study differences in research design. There was a significant positive association between absolute effect size and repeatability of behaviours, suggesting that within-individual variation of behavioural traits can set up an upper limit for the strength of the detected phenotypic correlations. Moreover, spatial overlap between the contexts in which different behaviours were assayed increased the magnitude of the association. The small effect size for the focal relationship implies that a huge sample size would be required to demonstrate a correlation between behaviours with sufficient statistical power, which is fulfilled only in very few studies. This suggests that behavioural syndromes often remain undetected and unpublished. Collectively, our meta-analysis revealed a number of points that might be worth to consider in the future study of behavioural syndromes.","10.1007/s10682-012-9589-8","0269-7653","1573-8477","ISI:000307552500008",NA,"CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602 Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183","CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011 Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015",NA,508,13,368,"#000000",NA,""

These differences can be expressed in two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The former is characterized by consistent responses in one context (i.e. repeatability), whereas the latter by consistency that spans contexts (i.e. behavioral syndromes). The proximate causes of behavioral consistency remain unclear, yet there is evidence that physiology may couple the expression of some behavioral traits in unrelated contexts. We therefore explored the correlation between bold behavior of female sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and the condition of the hepatopancreas, an organ vital to crustacean metabolism and reproduction. We did this by taking replicate measurements of two risk-taking behaviors per individual in the contexts of predator avoidance and environment exploration, and examining correlations within and between these observations. We then determined the relationship of behavior with hepatopancreas mass and lipid content. Individual crabs responded consistently within each context. However, across-context correlations were absent, indicating that boldness is isolated, at least in the selected scenarios. Additionally, anti-predator and exploratory behaviors were significantly influenced by size but not linked to hepatopancreas physiology.

These phenomena may violate statistical assumptions about the non-random variance component in sampling effort. A major reason why this assumption is often not fulfilled is because the probability of being sampled (i.e., being captured or observed) may depend on species-specific characteristics. Here, we test this assumption by using information on within-species sample sizes and missing data from five independent comparative datasets of European birds. First, we show that the two estimates of data availability (missing values and within-species sample size) are positively correlated and are associated with research effort in general (the number of papers published). Second, we demonstrate biologically meaningful relationships between data availability and phenotypic traits. For example, population size, risk-taking, and habitat specialization independently predicted within-species sample size. The key determinants of missing data were population size and distribution range. However, data availability was not structured by phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate that the accuracy of sampling is repeatable and distributed non-randomly among species, as several species-specific attributes determined the probability of observation. Therefore, data availability seems to be a species-specific trait that can be shaped by ecology, life history, and behavior. Such relationships raise issues about non-random sampling, which requires attention in comparative studies.","10.1007/s00265-012-1370-z","0340-5443",NA,"ISI:000307510600019",NA,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011",NA,510,637,166,"#000000",NA,""

In addition, most behavioral studies do not examine the effects at multiple time points. This study examined the effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on behavior when male Siamese fighting fish encounter female and male dummy conspecifics simultaneously. Thus, how chemical exposure impacts behavioral consistency and whether individuals differ in their sensitivity to exposure was assessed. Overall aggression was reduced after fluoxetine administration while courtship was unaffected. Fluoxetine affected behavioral consistency towards both the male and female, with individuals behaving less consistently to the male and more consistently to the female. In addition, males appeared to differ in their sensitivity to fluoxetine exposure as not all males reduced their aggression after administration. This has important implications for studying the effects of unintended pharmaceutical exposure. Exposure may have evolutionary implications as it may influence both territorial defense and mating success. In sum, these findings demonstrate that pharmaceutical exposure may alter more than just overall level of behavior and stress the importance of examining the effects of exposure on an individual level.

Here we examine the morphological correlates of grip strength, a defensive combat trait involved in mate guarding, in the tenebrionid beetle Bolitotherus cornutus.

We used nine species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity. We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others.

Fish with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow-and deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration. Natural selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual characteristics tended to persist and therefore may be termed personality traits. We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries management should consider fish behavior.

A number of temperament and related behaviour tests have been developed in order to make assessment of equine personality more objective. However, rarely these tests have been validated for their use as a selection tool. Thus, as a first step the aim of the present study was to integrate a temperament tests into horse performance tests, in order to assess variability and repeatability of horses' reactivity under the rider and the reliability of the judges' assessment thereof. The temperament test was comprised of three novel stimuli, including a visual stimulus (BALL), a visual and tactile stimulus (GATE), and a visual and auditory stimulus (CANS). A total of 224 mares and stallions were subjected to the test during their participation in station performance tests for riding horses, and 133 of these horses were subjected to the test a second time either 2-3 weeks or 18 weeks after the first test. Horses were ridden in the test by professional riders, and their reactions to the stimuli were evaluated each by two judges and the rider using scores on a scale from 1 (task not concluded) to 10 (completely calm but attentive horse). Mean scores (+/- SD) ranged between 6.6 +/- 2.4 (GATE) and 7.8 +/- 2.1 (BALL), demonstrating lower means and considerably higher standard deviations than the same horses' scores from present evaluation of the trait labelled temperament (8.1 +/- 0.9) or related personality traits (e.g. character: 8.3 +/- 0.8). Using variance components from mixed model analysis, inter-observer agreement between the two judges was for the individual stimuli very high (0.95 (BALL), 0.96 (GATE), 0.89 (CANS)), and there was likewise high agreement between the judges' and the riders combined scores (0.93). Repeatabilities of horses' scores were 0.72 (BALL), 0.75 (GATE), and 0.69 (CANS). Correlations to traits from the present evaluation of personality were low or non-existent, indicating that these traits are not a reflection of anxiety or fear reactivity as assessed by novel object tests. Horses' improvement in judges' combined scores from first to second test was not (P > 0.1) influenced by differences in time between tests, but differed between breed-types and individual riders. Also, not surprisingly, the higher horses' scores in the first test were, the lower their improvement in the second test was (-0.45 +/- 0.06 per additional score in the first test). Temperament tests using novel stimuli presented to horses under a rider may be a practical and valid tool for improving the current assessment of equine personality traits during performance tests. Considering a combination of absolute scores and horses' improvement in scores of repeated tests, rather than measuring only absolute scores yields relevant information about horses' personality, and at the same time it may prevent owners from deliberately training their horses for low reactions to the test-stimuli.

At a population level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness. We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e. shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However, an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour.

Forty birds of differing head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour. Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder); (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4) boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect this to function as a signal in competitive and cooperative (social) contexts.

Consequently, a degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an organism's ability to cope with novel (e. g. urban) environments. Yet behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated between-and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness, whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would be a possible scenario.

We found that populations of D. merriami exhibited more aggression at sites with more competition. Contrary to theoretical predictions and empirical results in other systems, the sites with the greatest spatial heterogeneity and highest levels of competition did not exhibit the most behavioral variation among individuals. However, the greatest within-individual behavioral variability in boldness (response to cues of predator presence) was exhibited where spatial heterogeneity was highest. Aggression and boldness of D. merriami were highly repeatable, that is, individuals behaved in a consistent manner over time, and the two behaviors were also highly correlated. Interestingly, the strength of this correlation was greatest where the competitive community was least diverse.

Intraindividual variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals. Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using `boldness' data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications of our findings for methods currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals.

Within the human personality literature, the big five personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with testosterone suggested to underpin traits such as aggressiveness. In non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression may be influenced by ecology, mating system and sexual selection. While most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Behaviour is often assumed to be the most flexible of traits, yet recent studies show a high repeatability of behaviour within individuals even across different functional contexts. Such consistent expression of behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct behaviours. 2. Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens on aggression and mating behaviour. 3. We found that androgen concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences among individuals in aggression. 4. These findings suggest that decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an important step in the evolution of personality traits.","10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.01966.x","0269-8463",NA,"ISI:000304256500003",NA,NA,NA,NA,524,460,165,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we investigate the possibility that stable between-individual differences in startle-response durations influence fighting ability or `resource-holding potential' (RHP) in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina. Both winners and losers showed significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual losers than for eventual winners, indicating that RHP varies with boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses inflicted more attacks on their opponent. Both repeatability and mean-level responses were changed by the experience of fighting, and these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was disrupted to a greater extent and the mean startle-response durations were subject to a greater increase than in winners. Thus, following a fight, this behavioural correlate of RHP behaves in a way similar to post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between winners and losers. Understanding the links between aggression and boldness therefore has the potential to enhance our understanding of both the evolution of animal personality and the `winner and loser effects' of post-fight changes in RHP.","10.1098/rspb.2011.2418","0962-8452",NA,"ISI:000302779600005",NA,"Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538 Rudin, Fabian/0000-0003-4539-3074","Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013 Rudin, Fabian/B-5877-2015",NA,525,336,167,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk. Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10 m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments. This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among individuals in dominant social classes.

Here, we tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2 components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator models) or is simply related to variation in general activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast, our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition, we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other approaches.

We quantified food sampling behavior (i.e., number of items sampled, visit duration, and number of items taken) of individual Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) during experimental field trials. Sampling behavior of individual jays was moderately repeatable within and between winter field seasons and was positively correlated with birds' willingness to approach a novel object and take food in front of a predator mount. These results suggest that food sampling is a measurable component in the suite of traits comprising the Steller's jay behavioral syndrome.

By applying an `animal model' approach to observational data, we show that antipredator behaviour of adult Alpine swifts was significantly repeatable over lifetime (r = 0.273) and heritable (h(2) = 0.146). Regression models also show that antipredator behaviours differed between colonies and sexes (females were more tame), and varied with the hour and year of capture. By applying a parent-offspring regression approach to 59 offspring that were exchanged as eggs or hatchlings between pairs of nests, we demonstrate that offspring behaved like their biological parents rather than like their foster parents when they were adults themselves.

Male Siamese fighting fish exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously. However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days.","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.02017.x","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000301352900004",NA,"Dzieweczynski, Teresa/0000-0002-5182-9914",NA,NA,531,506,583,"#000000",NA,""

Hiding behaviour was rank-order repeatable, and in general, juveniles were bolder than adults. Individuals that were cautious at early juvenile stages had higher encapsulation responses late in life compared with bold individuals. Most clearly, fast-growing individuals matured early and invested little in immune defence compared with their slower-growing conspecifics, i. e. showed patterns of a ` grow fast, die young' life-history strategy. 4.

For instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\% and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the relevance of our results in relation to the different factors influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of life-history traits and personality.","10.1111/j.1474-919X.2012.01216.x","0019-1019",NA,"ISI:000301283100014",NA,NA,"David, Morgan/G-8593-2011 Auclair, Yannick/B-6308-2012",NA,533,403,196,"#000000",NA,""

However, there is some concern that studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting.

One increasingly prevalent view is that realized competitive ability varies because it represents alternative strategies that arise because of the costs associated with competitiveness. Here we use a population of great tits (Parus major) to explore whether individual differences in competitive ability when foraging can be explained by two traits that have previously been linked to alternative behavioural strategies: the personality trait `exploration behaviour' and a simple cognitive trait, `innovative problem-solving performance'. We assayed these traits under standardized conditions in captivity and then measured competitive ability at feeders with restricted access in the wild. Competitive ability was repeatable within individual males across days and correlated positively with exploration behaviour, representing the first such demonstration of a link between a personality trait and both competitive ability and food intake in the wild. Competitive ability was also simultaneously negatively correlated with problem-solving performance; individuals who were poor competitors were good at problem-solving. Rather than being the result of variation in `individual quality', our results support the hypothesis that individual variation in competitive ability can be explained by alternative behavioural strategies.","10.1098/rspb.2011.1539","0962-8452",NA,"ISI:000300417000017",NA,NA,NA,NA,537,411,330,"#000000",NA,""

The fish were subjected to three sets of challenges (novel object test, resident-intruder test and confinement stressor test), all which were repeated a week later. Introducing a novel object evoked a divergent behavioral response in association with feeding: fish from the LR line displayed consistently suppressed feed intake while the HR fish remained unaffected. This observation was found to be repeatable along with attack latency and movement activity from the resident-intruder and confinement stressor tests.

We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences.","10.1093/beheco/arr185","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000300733800010",NA,"Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624","Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013 ",NA,539,413,507,"#000000",NA,""

Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets, adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets. Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when they were nymphs, versus when they were adults.","10.1007/s00265-011-1286-z","0340-5443",NA,"ISI:000300248300006",NA,"Kortet, Raine/0000-0003-3749-1096","Kortet, Raine/J-5027-2012",NA,541,528,552,"#000000",NA,""

Specifically, we tested whether measures of behavioral response to human approaches are associated with either patch area or patch openness and thus to area sensitivity. We made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010, measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling. Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong effect of area or openness on either flight-initiation distance or distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches.

In that context, it has recently been suggested that handling stress, measured through breathing rate during handling, could be a good descriptor of personality, at least in passerine birds. The authors experimentally investigated to what extent handling stress was correlated with personality in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), as assessed from a suite of repeatable behavioral traits, including activity, exploratory behavior, neophobia, and reaction to startle. Although breathing rate was repeatable across individuals, it was not related to any behavioral trait, suggesting that it cannot be used to quickly predict personality, at least in zebra finches. Breathing rate during handling, in addition, was related to morphology, questioning the fact that breathing rate during handling reflects personality irrespective of individual state.

We test the hypothesis that parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the relationship between infection by four trematode species and the correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue. Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis, Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the association depending on the behaviour tested.

An archetypical example is core temperature (T-c), long used for quantifying initial drug sensitivity and tolerance acquisition over repeated drug administrations. Our previous work suggested that rats differing in initial sensitivity to nitrous oxide (N2O)-induced hypothermia would exhibit different patterns of tolerance development across N2O administrations. Specifically, we hypothesized that rats with an initially insensitive phenotype would subsequently develop regulatory overcompensation that would mediate an allostatic hyperthermic state, whereas rats with an initially sensitive phenotype would subsequently compensate to a homeostatic normothermic state. To preclude confounding due to handling and invasive procedures, a valid test of this prediction required non-invasive thermal measurements via implanted telemetric temperature sensors, combined direct and indirect calorimetry, and automated drug delivery to enable repeatable steady-state dosing. We screened 237 adult rats for initial sensitivity to 70\% N2O-induced hypothermia. Thirty highly sensitive rats that exhibited marked hypothermia when screened and 30 highly insensitive rats that initially exhibited minimal hypothermia were randomized to three groups (n=10 each/group) that received: (1) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\% N2O using a classical conditioning procedure, (2) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\% N2O using a random control procedure for conditioning, or (3) a no-drug control group that received custom-made air. Metabolic heat production (via indirect calorimetry), body heat loss (via direct calorimetry) and T-c (via telemetry) were simultaneously quantified during N2O and control gas administrations. Initially insensitive rats rapidly acquired (3rd administration) a significant allostatic hyperthermic phenotype during N2O administration whereas initially sensitive rats exhibited classical tolerance (normothermia) during N2O inhalation in the 4th and 5th sessions. However, the sensitive rats subsequently acquired the hyperthermic phenotype and became indistinguishable from initially insensitive rats during the 11th and 12th N2O administrations. The major mechanism for hyperthermia was a brisk increase in metabolic heat production. However, we obtained no evidence for classical conditioning of thermal responses. We conclude that the degree of initial sensitivity to N2O-induced hypothermia predicts the temporal pattern of thermal adaptation over repeated N2O administrations, but that initially insensitive and sensitive animals eventually converge to similar (and substantial) magnitudes of within-administration hyperthermia mediated by hyper-compensatory heat production.

Consistent individual behavioural differences imply limited behavioural plasticity, but the proximate causes and wider consequences of this potential constraint remain poorly understood. To date, few attempts have been made to explore whether individual variation in behavioural plasticity exists, either within or between populations. 3. We assayed ` exploration behaviour' among wild-caught individual great tits Parus major when exposed to a novel environment room in four populations across Europe. We quantified levels of individual variation within and between populations in average behaviour, and in behavioural plasticity with respect to (i) repeated exposure to the room (test sequence), (ii) the time of year in which the assays were conducted and (iii) the interval between successive tests, all of which indicate habituation to novelty and are therefore of functional significance. 4. Consistent individual differences ('I') in behaviour were present in all populations; repeatability (range: 0.34-0.42) did not vary between populations. Exploration behaviour was also plastic, increasing with test sequence - but less so when the interval between subsequent tests was relatively large - and time of year; populations differed in the magnitude of plasticity with respect to time of year and test interval. Finally, the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour increased significantly from first to repeat tests in all populations. Individuals with high initial scores showed greater increases in exploration score than individuals with low initial scores; individual by environment interaction ('I x E') with respect to test sequence did not vary between populations. 5. Our findings imply that individual variation in both average level of behaviour and behavioural plasticity may generally characterize wild great tit populations and may largely be shaped by mechanisms acting within populations. Experimental approaches are now needed to confirm that individual differences in behavioural plasticity (habituation) - not other hidden biological factors caused the observed patterns of I x E. Establishing the evolutionary causes and consequences of this variation in habituation to novelty constitutes an exciting future challenge.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01877.x","0021-8790",NA,"ISI:000297849300013",NA,"Library, Library/0000-0002-3835-159X Matthysen, Erik/0000-0002-7521-9248","Overveld, Thijs/J-6501-2014 Library, Library/A-4320-2012 ",NA,550,646,106,"#000000",NA,""

The individual quality hypothesis proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated, because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as a random effect, we found that consistent differences between individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of each are context dependent.

To this end, we used 1129 nest observation periods from 118 nests across 4 populations to examine how parental nest visitation varied according to sex, food availability, and offspring need (brood size and age) in the stitchbird (hihi: Notiomystis cincta). Males increased their provisioning proportional to brood size regardless of food availability, whereas females did not increase provisioning to larger broods unless food supplemented. Male provisioning consistently followed the age-dependent energy requirements of the nestlings, whereas females showed little or no brood age-provisioning relationships. Thus, males were more sensitive than females to changes in the energy demands of their offspring; however, this was probably because females were already providing food at a high rate and could not respond to increased demand unless given additional food. Sex and habitat-specific repeatability estimates of parental effort suggest that variation in female provisioning behavior tends to be driven by differences in the local environment, whereas variation in male provisioning is more related to differences in individual quality. These sex-specific responses of parental care can be largely explained by the relative benefits of provisioning; females provisioned at a high rate to offspring they knew to be their own, based on available resources. In contrast, when food was abundant, males did not increase their provisioning to offspring probably because of the opportunity for additional matings via forced extrapair copulations.","10.1093/beheco/arr145","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000298386500005",NA,"Low, Matthew/0000-0002-7345-6063","Low, Matthew/D-2292-2013 ",NA,552,246,192,"#000000",NA,""

Temperament is an individual trait influencing an animal's behavioural response to handling. This characteristic likely modulates the response of the animal to environments and social situations, and is perhaps best viewed as a component of its personality. We assessed temperament using three objective measuring tools, to determine if correlations exist between these and a traditional subjective evaluation. The tools used were strain gauges, a ``movement measuring device{''} (MMD), and a chute exit timer. Four hundred steers were used. Exit time was correlated with values recorded with the MMD and absolute strain forces, and MMD values were related to absolute strain forces. When the animals were classified as ``calm{''} or ``wild{''} based on their subjective scoring, these two groups differed in their mean exit times, MMD values and absolute strain forces. The three objective measures yielded statistically correlated results between tests and across repetitions, and therefore may quantify correlated aspects of a personality trait (i.e., temperament). The objective scores were related to the traditional subjective score, but they provide the advantage of eliminating observer bias and may offer better tools for temperament selection. Significant positive relationships of daily gain with subjective score and M M D values indicate that traditional subjective scoring techniques can be replaced with more repeatable objective measures when temperaments are assessed for performance studies.","10.4141/CJAS2010-041","0008-3984",NA,"ISI:000299241400003",NA,NA,"Watts, Jon/B-4576-2012 Watts, Jonathan/I-1838-2012",NA,553,568,448,"#000000",NA,""

Spider societies lack discrete morphological castes, but colony constituents can differ along any number of trait axes (e. g. body size). Here we tested for consistent individual differences in social tendency in five tropical spider species (genus Anelosimus). We further determined the extent to which social tendency is correlated with other aspects of an individual's behaviour that might reflect division of labour within colonies. We found that all five species showed repeatable within-species variation in social tendency, and increased social tendency was correlated with reduced aggressiveness towards prey and diminished boldness towards an aversive stimulus (i.e. test species shared a similar `behavioural syndrome' of aggressiveness/sociality). Furthermore, colonies of some species (e.g. Anelosimus eximius, Anelosimus oritoyacu) appeared to be composed of varying proportions of two `behavioural types', whereas other species (Anelosimus domingo, Anelosimus guacamayos) showed a more continuous distribution of trait values. Interestingly, irrespective of species, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of aggressive colony constituents and group size, where larger colonies tended to have fewer aggressive females. Our results indicate that (1) the majority of social Anelosimus show similar within-species behavioural variation and syndromes, and (2) colony size either mediates the expression/development of individuals' behavioural types, or is regulated by the frequency of behavioural types.

It has never been assessed whether these relationships exist in calmer Bos taurus breeds in systems where handling is more frequent. Such systems predominate in some countries where beef production is a major agricultural activity. During fattening, 144 crossbred cattle from Limousin and Aberdeen Angus sires were assessed for temperament using 4 approaches: response to movement along a race (race score; 4 occasions), restraint in a crush (crush score; 4 occasions), flight speed from the crush (flight speed; 4 occasions), and isolation in a pen with a human (isolation score; 1 occasion in yr 1, 2 occasions in yr 2). Measurements of ADG were made between birth and slaughter and between 16 and 18 mo of age during fattening. Fattening occurred indoors on a complete mixed diet fed for ad libitum intake. Meat quality was measured by pH, color, and Volodkevitch shear force and by a sensory panel. The repeatability of temperament traits was 0.17 (race score), 0.35 (crush score), 0.51 (flight speed), and 0.36 (isolation score). The proportion of the total variance of temperament traits attributable to the sire and the social group was low (0.003 to 0.402). However, the sire did affect behavior in all tests apart from the crush score (ranging from P = 0.02 to P < 0.001). Correlations between behavior in the different tests (ranging from r = 0.21 to 0.54, and P = 0.02 to P < 0.001) apart from between-flight speed and isolation score indicate that fearful behavior was consistently shown across assessment methods. A calm response in the crush score test was associated with a greater ADG during fattening (P = 0.05), whereas a calm response during the isolation test was associated with a greater ADG in cold carcass weight (P = 0.02). Animals with a calm isolation score had less tender meat as judged by the sensory panel (P = 0.03), but no other effects were apparent between temperament and meat quality measures, although several tendencies (0.06 <= P <= 0.10) were found. Temperament did not appear to relate to meat quality in this study of frequently handled Bos taurus genotypes, which is in contrast to other studies using different beef production systems. Genetic correlations between temperament and meat quality under these conditions could, although not measured in this study, still exist in the absence of phenotypic correlations.","10.2527/jas.2010-3790","0021-8812",NA,"ISI:000297368200040",NA,"Bell, Matthew/0000-0003-0675-4797 Richardson, Ian/0000-0002-3514-7040 Roehe, Rainer/0000-0002-4880-3756",NA,NA,555,53,225,"#000000",NA,""

While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality. Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we suggest there is merit in modelling both within-and among-individual variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models. Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects, which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory. Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e. g., mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual aggressiveness.","10.1371/journal.pone.0028024","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000298168100031","e28024","Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051","Wilson, Alastair/F-3118-2010 ",NA,556,321,436,"#000000",NA,""

We report here on the behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations. Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration, integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 +/- 66.6 (mean +/- S.E.) and 678.2 +/- 115.8 ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8 and 2.2 ng/mL respectively, P < 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased propensity for locomotory behaviours (P = 0.001), maintenance behaviours (P = 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P = 0.04) over the period of captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P < 0.001) decreased, probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability (Repeatability = 0.592 +/- 0.084, P < 0.0001). Significant repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability = 0.619 +/- 0.166, P = 0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability = 0.368 +/- 0.166, P = 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response at release (P = 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P = 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity, may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival.

We assessed the exploratory behavior of individual birds in a novel environment task. We then recorded the vocalizations and accompanying motor behavior of both male and female chickadees, over the course of several days, in two different contexts: a control condition with no playback and a stressful condition where chick-a-dee mobbing calls were played to individual birds. We found that several vocalizations and behaviors were repeatable within both a control and a stressful context, and across contexts. While there was no relationship between vocal output and exploratory behavior in the control context, production of alarm and chick-a-dee calls in the stressful condition was positively associated with exploratory behavior. These findings are important because they show that bird calls, in addition to bird song, are an aspect of personality, in that calls are consistent both within and across contexts, and covary with other personality measures (exploration).","10.1007/s00114-011-0842-8","0028-1042",NA,"ISI:000297547500008",NA,"Guillette, Lauren/0000-0002-8777-6543 Sturdy, Christopher/0000-0003-2721-3770","Guillette, Lauren/K-8154-2013 ",NA,558,298,180,"#000000",NA,""

Plasticity was also evident and differed between the sexes. Male visit rate was associated with changes in brood size and time of day, but female visit rate was associated with changes in nestling age and date. In both sexes changes in visit rate were positively correlated with changes in their partner's visit rate. Both sexes also exhibited multidimensional reaction norms; interaction terms revealed that within-individual visit rates increased more steeply with brood size when nestlings were older, and the effect of the partner's visit rate was sensitive to variation in date, precipitation, and the focal bird's age. Individuals also varied in how they responded (reaction norm slope) to changes in nestling age and partner visits. Moreover, parental personality was interdependent with individual plasticity in several ways. Individuals of both sexes with a high visit rate also responded more positively to changes in nestling age, and males also showed this pattern with changes in partner visit rate. Explicit use of the behavioral reaction norm integrated personality and plasticity, revealed that these are not opposing concepts, and stimulated new hypotheses about sexual conflict over care and provisioning as a life-history trait.","10.1086/662173","0003-0147","1537-5323","ISI:000296715600011",NA,"Ensminger, Amanda/0000-0002-2913-6951 Westneat, David/0000-0001-5163-8096 Wetzel, Daniel/0000-0001-6375-6743","Ensminger, Amanda/M-6196-2013 ",NA,559,289,186,"#000000",NA,""

This study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability', `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a broad range of social and non-social behaviours.

Studies on the effects of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) on behaviour, however, rarely examine these effects over multiple trials, across time, or across contexts. In addition, it is possible that individuals vary in their sensitivity to EE2 and individuals may differ in the degree to which their behaviour is affected. The study of consistent individual differences in behaviour has grown in popularity in recent years perhaps because of the evolutionary questions this behavioural variation raises. Adult male threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from an anadromous population repeatedly received the simultaneous presentation of a dummy male and dummy female conspecific both before and after exposure to a short-term, nominal (15 ng L(-1)) concentration of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2). These before and after measures were then compared against one another as well as against responses of males in a control group that was not exposed to EE2. Courtship, aggression, and nesting behaviours were all affected by EE2 exposure. In addition, behavioural consistency over trials was markedly reduced after EE2 exposure, as shown by lower repeatability values in the after exposure measures and in weaker correlations between the before and after exposure measures in the EE2 group compared to the control group. This suggests that male threespine stickleback vary in their sensitivity to EE2. This study is one of the first to examine the effects of short-term EE2 exposure on behaviour across trials and has important implications for population-level fitness consequences of xenooestrogens.

We repeatedly tested the responses of female Western Black Widows, Latrodectus hesperus, to two cues of habitat quality: prey chemical cues and variation in web site illuminance. We estimated females' response by the distance they positioned themselves from (1) the source of prey chemical cues and (2) the darkest edge of our test arena. Individuals with low variance in their responses are deemed more ``choosy{'' whereas individuals with high variance are deemed less ``choosy{'' Generally, most females initiated web construction near the source of the prey chemical cues and tended to place themselves in low-light conditions. However, we detected strong, repeatable differences in females' intensity of response, and within-individual variance of response (i.e., choosiness) was correlated across situations: females with highly consistent responses towards cricket chemical cues also exhibited highly consistent responses towards variation in light conditions. When deprived of food for extended periods, females were indistinguishable in their responses towards prey chemical cues, but tended to initiate web construction in brighter lighting conditions. Food-deprived females universally exhibited higher variance and diminished consistency in their responses (i.e., they were less choosy). Additionally, higher choosiness was associated with greater mass loss during choice trials, suggesting choosiness is energetically costly. Our results demonstrate that consistency of response to environmental cues is yet another element of behavior that varies among individuals and variation in choosiness could beget speed/quality trade-offs during animal decision making.","10.1007/s00265-011-1208-0","0340-5443",NA,"ISI:000295426600015",NA,NA,NA,NA,562,313,482,"#000000",NA,""

Studying such variation is challenging because it involves documenting inherently subjective phenomena. However, observations of behaviour may provide objective descriptions of mental representations. We used the behaviour of Frontinella communis spiders after removal of prey from their webs as an assay of the contents of their memories of the prey. Spiders searched for lost prey, exerting greater effort in searching for larger prey, and distinguishing between the object of the search and old prey remnants. We thus infer that spider memories included information about prey features such as size or quality. We found significant repeatability in the spiders' searching behaviour, suggesting repeatability in memory content. As an indication of consistent between-individual differences in searching and memory, these repeatability estimates suggest that selection may act to shape mental representations and their relationship with foraging behaviour.","10.1007/s10071-011-0402-9","1435-9448",NA,"ISI:000294346400007",NA,NA,NA,NA,565,215,107,"#000000",NA,""

Genetically identical clones expressed various phenotypes but different clones produced different proportions of each phenotype (dropper, nondropper, and inconsistent). Manipulations of early environmental conditions had little qualitative impact on such patterns. We discuss the importance of our findings for future studies of the evolutionary and ecological consequences of personality variation. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several studies suggest that kin selection alone cannot be invoked to explain variation in helping for many species, but there have been few explicit tests of this under controlled conditions. Here, we investigated whether relatedness to the breeding pair or consistent individual differences in behaviours explained variation in helping by the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. We established standardized social groups consisting of a breeding pair and one related (r = 0.5) and one unrelated (r = 0) helper. Two forms of helping, territory maintenance and territory defence, were measured repeatedly under controlled conditions: helping was variable between, but consistent within, individuals. Furthermore, there was some evidence that helpers that carried out more maintenance also performed more defence. Contrary to the kin selection hypothesis, relatedness did not predict the amount or variety of helping executed. Risk responsiveness, activity levels and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals, so constituted `behavioural types' (or personality traits), but were uncorrelated with each other. More aggressive, risk-prone or more active helpers participated in more territory defence than submissive, risk-averse or inactive helpers. Risk-prone individuals contributed more to territory maintenance than risk-averse helpers. Overall, differences in behavioural type, rather than relatedness, explained most variation in helping behaviour in N. pulcher. This study highlights the importance of considering consistent individual differences in behaviour for predicting participation and performance in complex social interactions.

Behavioural measurements included scores and linear measurements for reactivity (R), activity (A), time to calm down (T) and emotionality (E), recorded during the approach (1) and/or during confrontation with the stimulus (2). Sixty-five horses were each confronted 3 times (1 ridden, 1 led, 1 free running in balanced order) with 3 novel and/or sudden stimuli. Mixed model analysis indicated that leading resulted in the lowest (P < 0.05 throughout) reactions as measured by A1, A2, El, E2, R2, and pNN50 while riding produced the strongest (A1, T2, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) or medium (El, E2, R2) reactions. Free running resulted either in the strongest (A2, El, E2, R2) or in the lowest (A1, 12, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) reactions. The repeatability across tests for HR (0.57), but not for RMSSD (0.23) or pNN50 (0.25) was higher than for any behavioural measurement: the latter ranged from values below 0.10 (A1, A2,T2) to values between 0.30 and 0.45 (El, E2, R2). Overall, the results show that a rider or handler influences, but not completely masks, the horses' intrinsic behaviour in a temperament test, and this influence appeared to be stronger on behavioural variables and heart rate variability than on the horses' heart rates. Taking both practical considerations and repeatabilities into account, reactivity appears to be the most valuable parameter. Emotionality and heart rate can also yield valid results reflecting additional dimensions of temperament although their practical relevance may be less obvious. If a combination of observed variables is chosen with care, a valid assessment of a horse's temperament may be possible in all types of tests. However, in practice, tests that resemble the practical circumstances most closely, i.e. testing riding horses under a rider, should be chosen. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, very little is known about the behavioural processes involved in ingesting food such as meal duration, feeding frequency and latency to start eating. This study aims at the characterization of feeding behaviour in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus in terms of consistency of individual differences over time and correlation with performance traits. Seventy-two individuals were individually housed for 27 days. These fish had three different weight (age) categories: low (initial body weight: 61.32 +/- 5.97 g), middle (151.19 +/- 4.26 g) and high (265.90 +/- 19.13 g), each containing 24 fish. Daily feed intake was recorded per fish. On days 8, 15 and 21 feeding behaviour was assessed by measuring the latency to start feeding (LAT. min), the total feeding time (TFT, min) and the number of feeding acts (NFA). In the end of the experimental period, fish were weighed and individual growth rate and feed efficiency (measured as residual feed intake) determined. Results show that feeding latency and the number of feeding acts have significant repeatability estimates for all weight classes. These estimates were, however, low in magnitude and decreased as the weight class increased. The correlation between the different feeding behaviours showed that individuals that are more active during feeding (higher NFA) on average, start to consume their feed earlier (lower LAT) and for longer periods (higher TFT). The number of feeding acts was significantly correlated with both feed intake and growth in all size classes. The residual feed intake was correlated with feeding latency only in the small weight class. These results showed that individual differences in feeding behaviour have low repeatability estimates and can partly explain differences in performance traits in juveniles of Nile tilapia.

From a signal design perspective, contact calls typically exhibit acoustic features that make them easily localizable and encode information about individual or group identity. Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) are unusual among vespertilionids in that they often emit a loud, partially audible frequency-modulated social call several times in rapid succession while in flight. This call appears to function as a contact call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and perform circular flights before entering a crevice roost. However, the degree to which pallid bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and what information is provided in the call is unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate pallid bat calling behavior to determine if calls attract roostmates or elicit responses from them and provide sufficient information for individual recognition. In playback studies, we found that contact calls elicit calls and approaches and that free-flying bats respond more to familiar than unfamiliar calls. In addition, analysis of frequency and temporal measurements of calls collected from multiple sites and spectral cross correlation analysis of calls recorded from the same radio-tagged bats on multiple evenings revealed that the frequency pattern of contact calls is highly repeatable over time within individuals but exhibits significant differences among individuals. Thus, contact call structure appears to be unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these calls well-suited for roostmate recognition.","10.1007/s00265-011-1168-4","0340-5443",NA,"ISI:000293379400010",NA,"Wilkinson, Gerald/0000-0001-7799-8444","Wilkinson, Gerald/E-4424-2011",NA,570,305,391,"#000000",NA,""

It is usually assumed that such consistent individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat. Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A. equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in species with simple nervous systems.","10.1371/journal.pone.0021963","1932-6203",NA,"ISI:000292632000042","e21963","Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538","Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013",NA,571,270,118,"#000000",NA,""

All of these traits are of broad ecological significance and two of them are repeatable or heritable in our population. Here, we show weak correlations between some but not all of these behavioural traits, and sex-dependent associations between all three behavioural traits and parasite infection. Infected males showed increased problem-solving performance whereas infected females showed reduced performance; furthermore, uninfected females were four times more likely to solve problems than uninfected males. Infected females were more exploratory than uninfected females, but infection had no effect on males. Finally, infected males were more risk-averse than uninfected males but females were unaffected. Our results demonstrate the potential for complex interactions between consistent personality variation and parasite infection, though we discuss the difficulty of attributing causality in these associations.

In recent years, individually distinct coping styles have also been observed in several species of fish. These individual differences may result in suboptimal production and compromised welfare in aquaculture. An approach to overcome these problems could be to sort fish and optimise rearing conditions according to coping style. It has been previously demonstrated that the proactive and reactive coping styles in fish can be characterised by contrasting behavioural responses to hypoxia. Two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) strains, bred for a low- (LR) and high- (HR) cortisol response to a standardized stressor, are suggested to resemble the proactive and reactive coping styles respectively. Therefore, these fish provided an opportunity for verifying a method for sorting fish with respect to coping style by exposure to hypoxia. Groups consisting of 24 individually tagged fish, 12 HR and 12 LR were exposed to hypoxia in a two choice system. The system consisted of a ``home{''} tank provided with cover connected to a second brightly ``illuminated{''} tank via a closable doorway. During the experiment, the doorway between the two tanks was opened and hypoxic conditions were gradually induced in the ``home{''} tank by bubbling with nitrogen. The latency time to move away from hypoxic conditions to normoxic conditions in the second tank was recorded for each individual. The oxygen saturation in each tank was measured every 30 min. The experiment consisted of two trials. Each trial was carried out in two sessions, switching the ``home{''} tank and ``illuminated{''} tank between Sessions 1 and 2. The results indicated that the response to hypoxia differed significantly between LR and HR individuals in both Session 1 (P < 0.05) and Session 2 (P <= 0.001). Furthermore, a higher number of HR individuals left hypoxic conditions compared to LR individuals in both Session 1 (P = 0.001) and Session 2 (P <= 0.001). Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate a repeatable difference in behavioural response to hypoxia between the two strains. The method presented could be utilized as a non-invasive method for sorting fish according to stress coping style. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One factor that could account for a portion of the residual variation is animal personality or consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, but no study has examined this relationship in a free-living population of mammals. In this paper, we test for a relationship between RMR and CIDs in activity in live-trapped meadow voles Microtus pennsylvanicus after controlling for the effect of body mass. We quantified the activity levels of voles both in an unfamiliar environment and for the first 2 min in the metabolic apparatus, and then measured RMR using open-flow respirometry. As expected, there was a linear relationship between RMR and body mass, and we found strong evidence for repeatable differences in activity levels between individuals. However, contrary to the hypothesis, we did not identify a significant correlation between CIDs in behaviour and RMR after controlling for body mass. Our results suggest that, at least within species, higher activity levels may not require a greater investment in energetically demanding tissues or increased capacity for processing of energy. Alternatively, if a relationship exists, our inability to detect it may reflect a weak behavioural signal in noisy RMR data that are influenced by many factors. Our results could also reflect an artefact of individual responses to stress or a sampling bias towards more exploratory individuals in animals captured by live-trapping.","10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00792.x","0952-8369",NA,"ISI:000292262700004",NA,NA,"Willis, Craig/F-5218-2013",NA,574,300,646,"#000000",NA,""

Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore, the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to affect individual success in competition by interference in a few species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored. We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session, individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the evolution of personality.

In contrast to human personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult. Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male. Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects of the early environment.

Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between males as well as greater variation between trials for individual females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and females.

Hatchery- and wild-reared brown trout were trained in two different foraging tasks: locating food hidden in a maze and finding a cryptic prey, and their performance within and across tasks was compared. Fish reduced their search time for cryptic prey, but not maze search time, by learning. In contrast to most previous studies hatchery-reared trout generally tended to be more successful feeders and showed faster learning than wild trout when foraging on cryptic prey. This appeared to be due to motivational effects rather than based on cognitive skills. In addition, we examine whether exploration behaviour in brown trout is repeatable across time and context (i.e. reflecting a behavioural syndrome). Individual exploration tendency was repeatable within tasks, suggesting the occurrence of personality in brown trout. However, individuals that were fast explorers in the cryptic prey task were not necessarily fast to explore the maze. Thus, a context-specific behavioural syndrome was found to best explain exploratory behaviour for both hatchery and wild trout. However, repeatability of exploration behaviour within tasks differed between hatchery and wild trout, where wild trout were found to be more consistent in their exploration strategy.

Consistent individual differences in these behaviours (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural selection.

For example, variation in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow' exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels. Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms and the phenotypic traits.

It is useful to determine whether there is consistency in FS in dairy cattle, and assess the relationship between FS and other subjective measures of responsiveness in dairy cattle. The aims of this study were to: (a) evaluate the repeatability of the FS and crush score (CS) test in dairy cattle by repeated measurements and (b) examine the correlation of FS and CS with reactivity responses in a human approach test (HAT). FS and CS measurements for 55 Holstein-Friesian heifers were conducted three times at 4-week intervals. Flight response to a HAT was assessed in the passageway of the home-pen on a subset of 33 animals. On completion of the HAT, an assessment of six qualitative terms (at ease, friendly, bold, docile, shy, fearful and nervous) were assessed on a visual analogue scale according to a subjective judgement of whether a cow scored low or high for each term. Correlations between the three monthly repetitions of FS measurements were all significant and positive (FS(1,2): r(s)=0.36, P=0.007: FS(2,3): r(s)=0.31, P=0.002: FS(1,3): r(s)=0.47, P<0.001) which indicates a level of individual consistency. No significant correlations between the three monthly repetitions of CS measurements were found. The mean FS was correlated with HAT flight response (r(s)=0.42, P=0.004). However, no significant correlations existed between the HAT and the CS. In conclusion, the results suggest that both HAT and FS measurements provide consistent (both intra- and inter-measure) assessments of temperament under these handling situations in dairy cows.

Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance. Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2, 7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack, ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of predation risk and mate attraction.","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01870.x","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000286889300007",NA,NA,NA,NA,583,650,249,"#000000",NA,""

However, there is still a scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family) on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family. It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in more natural circumstances.","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01860.x","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000285921900004",NA,NA,"Lanta, Vojtech/J-7032-2017",NA,584,159,78,"#000000",NA,""

The aim was to show that an algorithm to analyse continuous weight records could be used to measure activity quickly and efficiently using commercial weighing equipment and that this measurement is related to animal productivity, specifically liveweight. A prototype method required magnetic switches on the weighing crate to record gate positioning and enclosure of the animal, with data analysis subsequent to the completion of weighing. The method reported here does not require additional equipment, instead using a computer program to analyse weights in real-time to record the degree of sheep movement. The result is summarised as the coefficient of variation of the weight over a period of 8-20 s and reported as an activity score. The real-time method had a higher repeatability (P < 0.05) than the prototype method and gave a stronger association with liveweight with heavier lambs and heavier young sheep being less active under confinement at 6 months and 18 months, respectively (P < 0.05).

This phenomenon appears to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics. Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in both courtship and aggressive situations.","10.1163/156853911X618556","0005-7959",NA,"ISI:000301821100004",NA,"Dzieweczynski, Teresa/0000-0002-5182-9914",NA,NA,586,319,386,"#000000",NA,""

This situation commonly occurs in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. However, for selection to act effectively, individuals must behave in a consistent manner and measuring repeatability can aid in understanding how selection may shape such trade-offs. Males of this species exhibit consistent individual differences in their response to dummy males and females but it is unknown if patterns are similar when feedback from the stimuli is present. To assess this, male threespine stickleback were tested with dummy and live male and female conspecifics, presented separately and simultaneously. While the same trends were found regardless of stimulus type, males were more aggressive towards the live conspecifics than to the dummies. Repeatability values were similar within a treatment regardless of whether live or dummy conspecifics were used, suggesting that individuals show the same level of consistency.

We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs.

However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel object and the proportion of extrapair paternity.

Objective: To examine the psychometric properties of the EuroADAD across various settings in adolescent populations who developed or were at a high risk of developing substance use and psychosocial adaptation problems. Participants and Settings: Three of the samples were collected in Hungary, including: institutionalized youths from juvenile residential facility (n = 295); adolescents from outpatient psychiatry facility (n = 278), and controls (n = 59). An additional sample was collected in the Netherlands, and consisted of adolescent boys from an independent residential institution for youth with severe behavioral problems (n = 51). Procedure: The EuroADAD was administered by trained interviewers. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and self-report questionnaires. Results: Reliability: the intraclass correlation was high for all domains of the EuroADAD; reliability analyses indicated good test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Validity: difference among study samples was significant (p < 0.05) for the majority of the domains, with juvenile institution and psychiatric outpatient subjects exhibiting higher severity in most areas compared to controls. The Hungarian and Dutch samples were comparable, expect for the legal domain, due to the higher severity of behavioral problems in the Dutch sample. Several domains of the instrument, including `alcohol', `drugs' and `legal' showed an association with trait aggression as measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and with Novelty Seeking on the Cloninger Temperament and Character Inventory. Conclusion: Based on the pattern and significance of group differences, and correlations with other measures, the scale has good criterion, and convergent and discriminant construct validity.

We focused on some central aspects of bank vole behaviour: mobility, risk taking, exploratory behaviour, dominance, and aggressive behaviour towards pups. These behaviours were chosen because they directly affect bank vole survival or fitness or are classified as important factors of personality in other species. In total, 192 males from different populations went through four behavioural tests, in which 20 variables were measured. The tests were repeated after 3 weeks, which verified that all traits were stable, i.e. repeatable between trials. Three personality compounds emerged, named extroversion, novelty seeking and infanticide. Extroversion included dominance and mobility, while novelty seeking consisted of risk taking and exploration. Infanticide encompassed all indices measuring harmful behaviour towards pups. Mobility and dominance were connected, possibly because both seem to depend on condition. Time spent in captivity increased extroversion, which may be explained by good food, stable conditions and acclimation to strong social cues. Novelty seeking was connected to repeatability which could mean that novelty avoiding individuals adjust their behaviour to match new environments.

Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term.

We analysed sleep behaviour in a free-living population of blue tits in southern Germany. We recorded individuals roosting in nestboxes between November and April using infrared-sensitive cameras. We investigated the following sleep parameters: time of entering and leaving the nestbox, sleep onset, awakening time, sleep duration, midpoint of sleep, latency to sleep and frequency and duration of nocturnal awakenings. Sleep onset, awakening time and sleep duration followed seasonal changes in daylength. Blue tits slept ca. 4.8 h longer inwinter than in spring. During the night, birds woke up between 23 and 230 times, but this did not change seasonally. Local light conditions influenced awakening time: birds at brighter locations woke up earlier. Females slept on average 15 min longer per night than males and this sex difference became more pronounced in early spring. Although females spent a greater proportion of the night awake than males, they still slept more overall. First-year birds spent more time in the nestbox after waking up and left the nestbox later in the morning than older individuals. Repeatability estimates showed that individuals were consistent in their sleep behaviour over the 2-year study period. Our results indicate that sleep patterns are individual-specific traits in blue tits. We suggest that the observed sex difference in sleep duration is caused by sexual selection.

Studies generally report consistent individual differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested whether individuals change their activity level differently within a single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5 min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity patterns.

Increasing research is revealing the adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability. We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3 measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational patterns of trait repeatability.","10.1093/beheco/arq145","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000284429100016",NA,"van Dongen, Wouter/0000-0001-5007-3257","Sabat, Pablo/E-8829-2012 van Dongen, Wouter/L-1552-2014",NA,600,258,276,"#000000",NA,""

It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.","10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00141.x","1464-7931","1469-185X","ISI:000282880900013",NA,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182 Schielzeth, Holger/0000-0002-9124-2261","Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011 Schielzeth, Holger/F-1419-2011",NA,601,486,146,"#000000",NA,""

We used an integrative approach to quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities. We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was non-significant in all populations.

In doing so, we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a) related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c) correlated with behavioral output (e.g. aggressiveness) and productivity (e.g. growth).

Quantifying individual differences often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap, respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types, including trap-shy individuals.

We measured the behavioural type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and dispersal).

A rarely explored example of this is when both a male and a female are present simultaneously and a male must decide to fight or court. Consistent individual differences have been found in decision-making in Siamese fighting fish: however, dummies were used to explore this question and it is possible that individuals respond differently in this situation when faced with live stimuli as a result of feedback. Therefore, this study investigated whether males behave similarly to dummy and live stimuli by exposing them to male and female conspecifics both simultaneously and separately. Subjects were tested first with dummies and then in the same situations using live conspecifics. It was hypothesized that males would respond in the same manner to both the dummy and live fish. The results indicated that individuals behaved similarly to the dummy fish and the live fish in corresponding conditions. In addition, repeatability levels suggest that individuals behaved similarly across trials of a given treatment type while differing from one another in their responses. This study demonstrates that males are consistent in their responses even when receiving feedback from conspecifics and supports the continued use of dummy stimuli as an effective tool.

Altogether 15 measures were investigated. They were recorded during three farms visits (approximately 60 and a further 120 days apart) on 35 farms in Austria and Germany with cubicle, deep litter and tie stall systems. Seven measures occurred too infrequently (<1/h and 1\% respectively) to allow reliable recording within a limited observation time. IOR was generally acceptable to excellent (Spearman's r=0.7-1.0), except for `collision during lying down' with a PABAK of 0.2 (n = 15, observed on farm). However, after improvement of the definition IOR was good (0.78, n=65, observed from videos). Only three measures were acceptably repeatable overtime. `duration of lying down' (Kendall's W=0.78 for a minimum of 6 recorded occurrences), `percentage of collisions during lying down' (W=0.95) and `percentage of cows lying partly or completely outside lying area' (W=0.87). These measures are evaluated as suitable animal based welfare measures regarding resting behaviour in the framework of an on-farm welfare assessment protocol. They can be easily and reliably recorded within 2 h during a farm visit require only a short training period and show sufficient consistency of results over time. They, moreover, allow distinction between different housing systems. However their sensitivity with regard to differences between individual farms and within farms over time needs further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, work on the consequences of hormone profiles has traditionally ignored the large inter-individual variation within natural populations. However, recent research has advocated the need to explicitly consider this variation and address its consequences for selection. One of the key steps in this process is examining repeatability in hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits under selection. In this study we show that individuals within a free-ranging population of the Australian lizard Egemia whitii exhibit temporal repeatability in their circulating baseline testosterone concentrations as well as their aggressive response towards conspecific intruders. Furthermore, we show significant, sex-specific links between testosterone and aggression. Specifically, testosterone and aggression is negatively linked in males, while there is no relationship in females. As conspecific aggression has significant consequences for fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in this species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations, through their effects on aggression, could have important implications for individual fitness. We discuss the potential causes and consequences of hormonal repeatability as well as provide explanations for its sex-specific links with aggression. Specifically, we suggest that these patterns are the result of alternative hormonal pathways governing aggression within Egemia and may indicate a decoupling of aggression and testosterone across the sexes.

Variation in animal temperament is rapidly gaining interest and attention within behavioural and evolutionary ecology. If we are to understand the causes and consequences of temperament variation within and between populations we need to determine the selection pressures that affect temperament in natural environments. To date, however, the vast majority of temperament studies have been carried out on captive-bred individuals. This review highlights potential problems that arise from using captive animals to elucidate the ecological and evolutionary functions of temperament in wild populations. For example, development, learning and environmental variability can all affect behaviour. Thus, both environment and gene-by environment interactions can affect the fitness functions of different temperaments, and hence selection. We stress the need for measurements of repeatability and heritability, and the importance of biological and ecological validation of temperament tests in wild animals. We describe the limited evidence from wild populations of the fitness consequences of temperament variation, and the use of intra- and inter-specific comparisons to prove adaptation. To identify multiple axes of behavioural variation, and how these interact with environments that vary spatially and temporally, we need long-term studies on wild populations - yet few studies of this nature currently exist. Finally, and perhaps counter-intuitively, we suggest that there is much to be gained from incorporating some of the approaches and statistics employed in the much longer established field of human personality.","10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00714.x","0952-8369","1469-7998","ISI:000278927200001",NA,NA,"Archard, Gabrielle/G-1138-2011",NA,611,605,541,"#000000",NA,""

However, there is now evidence from a diverse range of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome? and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs.

In birds and mammals, such anti-predator vigilance has been well studied, and we know that it may be influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite hundreds of studies focusing on vigilance and suggestions that there are individual differences in vigilance, there have been no prior studies examining its heritability in the field. Here, we present one of the first reports of (additive) genetic variation in vigilance. Using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure, we found that, in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), the heritability of locomotor ability (h2 = 0.21), and especially vigilance (h2 = 0.08), is low. These modest heritability estimates suggest great environmental variation or a history of directional selection eliminating genetic variation in these traits. We also found a significant phenotypic (r(P) = -0.09 +/- 0.04, P = 0.024) and a substantial, but not significant, genetic correlation (r(A) = -0.57 +/- 0.28, P = 0.082) between the two traits (slower animals are less vigilant while foraging). We found no evidence of differential survival or longevity associated with particular phenotypes of either trait. The genetic correlation may persist because of environmental heterogeneity and genotype-by-environment interactions maintaining the correlation, or because there are two ways to solve the problem of foraging in exposed areas: be very vigilant and rely on early detection coupled with speed to escape, or reduce vigilance to minimize time spent in an exposed location. Both strategies seem to be equally successful, and this `locomotor ability-wariness' syndrome may therefore allow slow animals to compensate behaviourally for their impaired locomotor ability.","10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01967.x","1010-061X",NA,"ISI:000276861900001",NA,"Olson, Lucretia/0000-0002-5703-3351 Martin, Julien/0000-0001-7726-6809 Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244","Blumstein, Daniel/B-6199-2012 ",NA,614,267,74,"#000000",NA,""

Flight initiation distance (FID) has been measured in a variety of taxa as an estimate of the risk that an individual is willing to take when facing a predator. FID has been used to test life-history trade-offs related to anti-predatory behaviour and for conservation purposes such as to establish buffer zones to minimize human disturbance, given its species-specific consistency. Individual consistency in FID, however, has been largely overlooked. Here we show that, even after controlling for several confounding effects, this behaviour has a strong individual component (repeatability = 0.84-0.92) in a bird species, leaving a small margin for behavioural flexibility. We hypothesize that individuals may distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their individual susceptibility to human disturbance. This habitat selection hypothesis merits further research, given its implications on both evolutionary and applied ecology research. For example, selection of human-tolerant phenotypes may be promoted through the humanization of habitats occurring worldwide, and when population means instead of individual variability in FID are considered for designing buffer zones to reduce human impacts on wildlife.","10.1098/rsbl.2009.0739","1744-9561",NA,"ISI:000275432900006",NA,"Tella, Jose/0000-0002-3038-7424 Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950 CSIC, EBD Donana/0000-0003-4318-6602","Tella, Jose/I-3707-2015 Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009 CSIC, EBD Donana/C-4157-2011",NA,615,295,615,"#000000",NA,""

As predicted, aggression between males, and male display and sneak frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The function of aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect female access function through formation of dominance hierarchies or defence of resources.

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals.

Duration of death feigning clearly responded to selection, and significant value of realized heritability was detected in all replicates of the two strains.

Here, we tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species, juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration of a novel environment.

In particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank, which partially determines mating success in this species. The expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or genetic basis.

The birds were housed in; common-garden environment in captivity until full independence, after which their behaviour was tested. We found that androgen-treated males were more likely than control males to explore a novel environment and showed higher activity in the presence of a novel object. In response to a simulated predator attack androgen-treated males mainly showed freezing behaviour, while control males showed escape behaviour. Females from the androgen treatment and control group showed no differences in these behaviours. Androgen treatment did not affect neophobia (latency to approach the novel object) or dominance behaviour in either sex. Behaviour in the novel environment and towards a novel object was repeatable, but behaviours in the different experiments were mostly not inter-correlated. These results indicate that yolk androgens have various long-lasting effects on behaviour, especially in males, but that they do not induce a distinct behavioural syndrome. As behaviour is strongly linked with fitness, our results suggest that yolk androgens may play a role in determining fitness, and thus play a potentially adaptive role. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the runway test, the average latency to reach 5 m and 2 m from the herd and the time spent in these areas were recorded and analysed for repeatability. Latency to reach the 5 m line over the three tests was the most repeatable variable (0.54) and was taken as a measure of social motivation against which to assess other measures of sociability shown by the cows in their home-pen. The home-pen measures were the distance of each cow to the two nearest neighbours, location of the cow in the cow shed, and the level of synchrony based on individual behaviour of each focal cow compared with the rest of the herd's behaviour. Cows that had high latencies to reach the 5 m line had fewer recordings with two near neighbours (W(1) = 5.31, P = 0.021), were less synchronised with the herd (W(1) = 4.82, P = 0.028), were not present at the feedface during peak feeding (W(1) = 4.13, P = 0.042) and stood at the periphery of the cow shed (W(1) = 4.03, P = 0.045).

Correcting for potential range restriction among these high scoring individuals resulted in total and Factor 2 score measures of agreement that were somewhat more consistent with published research, but Factor 1 continued to display exceedingly poor agreement across examiners.

Many parasites have evolved the ability to modify the behaviour of their present host to increase the chance of transmission to the next host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted: phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly, amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts. Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome framework.","10.1163/000579509X12574307194101","0005-7959",NA,"ISI:000275079700007",NA,"Nakagawa, Shinichi/0000-0002-7765-5182 Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206","Nakagawa, Shinichi/B-5571-2011 Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008",NA,627,596,63,"#000000",NA,""

To assess consistency and plasticity in decision-making, male Siamese fighting fish were presented with a single female, single male and paired male and female presented simultaneously both when they did and did not have nests. Having a nest had a marked effect on male response, but only towards the female. Males differed from one another in the strategies they used when faced with conflicting stimuli; some males focused on the male, others on the female, and still others divided their response between the two. Most importantly, males behaved consistently yet differed from one another when context and reproductive state were constant. Finally, some males exhibited consistent plasticity as a result of social environment and/or reproductive state, the first finding of this kind.

It indicates that animal behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P. unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality and life-history traits that affect fitness.","10.3354/meps08899","0171-8630",NA,"ISI:000285419300023",NA,NA,"Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009",NA,629,662,222,"#000000",NA,""

Here, we examine the underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in the temperament trait `exploration behaviour in a novel environment' (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a passerine bird, the great tit Parus major. First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only moderately heritable and permanent environment (V(PE)) effects contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects. We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment, but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no evidence of any selection on EB through survival. Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients - local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any previous equivalent demonstrations. All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration behaviour (EB(2), measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate comparison with other studies. EB and EB(2) were strongly correlated to one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at the phenotypic level and V(PE) was undetected in EB(2). Selection on EB(2) was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective. Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait `exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong V(PE) effect detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an environmental context.","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01585.x","0021-8790",NA,"ISI:000270785600012",NA,"Bouwhuis, Sandra/0000-0003-4023-1578 Sheldon, Ben/0000-0002-5240-7828","Bouwhuis, Sandra/H-5270-2011 Sheldon, Ben/A-8056-2010",NA,632,268,378,"#000000",NA,""

The temperament trait of interest was aggressiveness during feeding in dairy cattle. In this study, we focused on whether it is possible to infer a trait of aggressiveness from the measurement of behavioural responses expressed by individual cows during feeding. Aggressive behaviour appears in many contexts but this paper focuses on aggressive behaviour in a competitive situation over a feed resource in housed dairy cattle. It is important that we fully understand within-cow consistency of aggressiveness in different competitive and social situations. To achieve this the following questions were investigated: (1) are cows consistent in how they express aggressive behaviour over time? (2) and across situations at a standard and reduced (competitive) feedface? The aim of this study was to measure the behavioural reactions of housed dairy cattle during feeding in a way that can be practically and easily recorded on commercial farms. Ten primiparous and 30 multiparous healthy lactating cows were housed in a group (parity = 3.5 +/- 2.15; mean +/- S.D.). The behaviour of the aggressor and recipient was recorded for each aggressive interaction for 60 min after feed arrival. Repeatability estimates and Kendall's coefficient of concordance were both used to assess consistency of aggressor and recipient behaviours across time. The within-cow repeatability was highest for `aggressive index' (r=0.31) and lowest for non-response behaviours (r=0.04) across time. Individual's responses to the standard and reduced feedface were significantly correlated for contact and non-contact behaviours. These results highlight the complexity of aggressive style of cows during feeding and illustrate that some measures of aggressive feeding behaviour are repeatable within cows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Few short and simple assessment instruments are available in French. Recently, the Questionnaire de Fonctionnement Social (QFS) was developed to study social behavior of psychiatric patients. The QFS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire assessing the frequency of and the satisfaction with social behavior during the last two weeks. The aim of the present study is to explore QFS psychometric properties in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorder. Methods. - Eighty-six outpatients (78 women and eight men, mean age: 30.5 +/- 8.6) with borderline personality disorder and 100 healthy matched control subjects (89 women and 11 men, mean age: 30.2 +/- 7.7) completed the QFS. The convergent and divergent validities of the QFS were tested with the following instruments: Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and a visual scale of suffering (EVS). Test-retest reliability of the QFS was calculated in a sub-sample of 28 subjects and its sensitivity to change was measured for 45 patients. Results. - Internal consistency of the QFS' global index was satisfying (Cronbach alpha from 0.59 to 0.84). Test-retest reliability of the QFS indexes ranged from 0.77 to 0.79 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Correlations between QFS and SASS demonstrated moderate convergent validity (r > 0.59) whilst associations with others psychological measures (BSI, BDI, BHS, EVS) showed satisfying divergent validity (-0.42 < r < -0.12). Discriminate validity was excellent as the group of healthy control subjects scored significantly higher than the group of patients in all variables (Mann-Whitney all p < 0.001). QFS sensitivity to change after psychotherapeutic treatment was good as shown by the significant change observed in Frequency and Satisfaction index (Wilcoxon respectively p = 0.002 and p < 0.001). Conclusion. - The QFS demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in the studied population. This study confirms it is a valuable tool. to assess social functioning of borderline personality disorder patients.

In a behavioural trade-off, individuals should act as if they have weighed these alternatives before acting. Because the costs and benefits of performing specific behaviours are likely to differ between individuals as a result of different environmental and/or genetic backgrounds, individuals should vary in the decisions they make. Male threespine stickleback establish territories and nest close to one another; thus, they may be faced with a decision: fight a potential rival male or court a female. To assess how males respond to the presence of conflicting stimuli, males were presented with a dummy female alone, a dummy male alone, a dummy male and a dummy female simultaneously, and two dummy females simultaneously. Repeatability scores indicated that individuals were consistent in their responses to a given stimulus within a treatment yet differed from one another in their responses. For example, some males were more vigorous courters than others. In the female-male treatment, some males focused on only one of the stimuli while others divided their time between the two. This finding suggests that males may use different strategies when conflicting stimuli are present. Few studies have empirically examined the choices that territorial males make when these competing options are presented simultaneously, even though this situation is probably common in the wild. This study provides insight into male decision making when stimuli that elicit mutually incompatible behaviours are present and suggests that there may be a genetic basis to these differences.

Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.

For each individual in the network, we quantify its behavioural phenotype using two measures of boldness, predator inspection tendency, a repeatable and reliably measured behaviour well studied in the context of co-operation, and shoaling tendency. We observe striking heterogeneity in contact patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly influenced by behavioural trait. We assert that such structure will have implications for the outcome of selection on behavioural traits and we speculate that the observed positive assortment may act as an amplifier of selection contributing to the maintenance of co-operation during predator inspection.","10.1007/s00265-009-0802-x","0340-5443","1432-0762","ISI:000268293700010",NA,"Darden, Safi/0000-0002-2567-7902 Croft, Darren/0000-0001-6869-5097 Krause, Jens/0000-0002-1289-2857","Krause, Jens/C-2750-2011 Darden, Safi/C-5940-2016 Croft, Darren/B-5503-2009 James, Richard/E-5061-2013 Krause, Jens/J-4381-2013",NA,637,84,535,"#000000",NA,""

We found that aggression directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction. Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context. Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context. Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context, may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior in this population.","10.1093/beheco/arp061","1045-2249","1465-7279","ISI:000268106800014",NA,NA,NA,NA,639,7,501,"#000000",NA,""

Aggressive nest defense was highly repeatable between breeding attempts (r = 0.52 +/- 0.05 standard error), but individuals also differed in their plasticity (the extent to which they adjusted the level of their aggression to the varying food conditions). Fierce nest defenders produced more recruits to the local breeding population, but a female's survival was not affected by her intensity of nest defense.

Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species. Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings, behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic plasticity in wild populations.","10.1093/beheco/arp067","1045-2249",NA,"ISI:000268106800020",NA,"Minderman, Jeroen/0000-0002-8451-5540",NA,NA,641,429,393,"#000000",NA,""

Previous studies have shown that eye white (EW) can be a predictor of a multitude of emotions across different situations, but there is little research on the relationship between EW and temperament. The objective of this experiment was to assess the accuracy and reliability of using the percentage of exposed EW as a predictor of temperament in beef cattle. Forty-eight heifers (group 1), 39 bulls (group 2), and 60 steers (group 3) were video-recorded while in a squeeze chute, and 2 still digital images from each animal were selected for EW determination. Chute temperament scores were assigned: 1 (calm) to 5 (agitated). Flight speeds were measured blindly and independently during a subsequent test in which the amount of time it took a solitary animal to pass a handler and travel a specified distance was recorded. The EW area in each image was measured using Sigmascan Pro 5 and was expressed as the percentage of exposed eye area. Each image was analyzed twice to determine tracing repeatability. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among 2 images of the same animal, as well as among duplicate readings of the same image to determine animal and tracing repeatabilities. The mean percentages of EW were 30.14 +/- 14.37, 31.43 +/- 14.77, and 28.57 +/- 12.38, and the average percentage accuracy for duplicate image EW measures was 96, 96, and 93 (P < 0.0001) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for EW percentage and chute temperament scores were 0.674 (P < 0.0001), 0.95 (P < 0.0001), and 0.696 (P < 0.0001), whereas the correlations between EW and flight speeds were 0.415 (P < 0.0001), 0.333 (P < 0.05), and 0.294 (P < 0.01) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch, we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration) between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts, the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion, the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and of considering the influence of social context in animal personality studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and evolutionary context.

Recent research now suggests that an individual's behaviour, once considered to be plastic, may be more predictable than previously thought. Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.

In this study, we focused on temperament tests in group-housed finishing pigs, with the objective of validating measures that are readily applicable in commercial settings and potentially related to individual differences in stress response. A total of 118 pigs in two replicate studies were housed in pens of 7-8 pigs per pen. At 24 weeks of age, animals were subjected to three tests of fear in the home pen: the human approach test (HAT), novel object test (NOT) and open door test(ODT). In each test, pigs were scored on their latency to contact the human or object, or to leave the home pen. Tests were repeated on three occasions at intervals of 3-4 days. On each test day the HAT was performed twice to compare results between different handlers. Behaviour in tests of fear was compared with two social tests in a subset of 58 pigs. Lesion scoring was performed after mixing as a measure of aggression, and a feed competition test was used to assess social status. Repeatability within-test was evaluated in a mixed model with pig as a random effect, and agreement between days, handlers and tests was evaluated by partial correlations after controlling for replicate, pen and day effects. Latency to perform all three fear tests decreased significantly over time. Correlations within-test showed significant agreement between all days for HAT and ODT, and between HAT handlers. Between tests, the HAT and ODT were correlated, and ODT and NOT tended to correlate. Comparisons between group fear tests and social tests showed that pigs which readily approach a human tended to have higher lesion scores and fewer feeding bouts in the feed competition trial. While test latencies decrease with repetition, the HAT and ODT show individual consistency over time, which suggests that these tests describe behavioural tendencies and may be useful for predicting fearful responses at slaughter.

By performing repeated behavioural trials for females, we show that average dispersal trait values decrease with increasing testing days. By comparing mated and unmated individuals during two periods (before and after mating for the mated group, and the same two periods for the unmated group), we show that mating has no effect on the mean displayed dispersal behaviour or its within-individual variation. Repeatabilities were high and consistent for ballooning motivation, but not for rappelling. 3. Ballooning motivation can be regarded as highly individual-specific behaviour, while general pre-dispersal and rappelling behaviours showed more individual variation.

Field studies looking at the relationship between personality and survival value early in life are greatly hampered by the fact that personality can at present only be assessed after individuals become independent from their parents. In passerines, for example, this is often after a period of intensive selection for the survival on fledglings. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop a method to measure personality before this period of selection. For this purpose, we developed the handling stress (HS) test. We measured HS in 14-d-old great tit nestlings by counting the number of breast movements (breath rate) in four subsequent 15-s bouts for 1 min; before and after they were socially isolated from their siblings for 15 min. To calculate the repeatability of HS, we repeated the test 6 mo later. To assess the relationship between HS and exploratory behaviour, we correlated the outcome of both tests. We ran tests both on birds of lines selected for extreme personality and on wild birds from a natural population. We found that birds selected for fast exploration reacted more to HS compared with birds selected for slow exploration and that HS was repeatable in different life phases. We confirmed this by finding an increase in the HS with increasing exploratory scores in wild birds. These results show that we can use the HS test as a measurement of personality, making it a potential tool for studying the relationship between personality and survival value early in life.","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01618.x","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000264307900009",NA,"van Oers, Kees/0000-0001-6984-906X","van Oers, Kees/B-2562-2009",NA,647,262,550,"#000000",NA,""

A dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However, we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are consistent with phenotype-dependent tactic use decisions.

The availability of a validated questionnaire to assess BIS and BAS over the telephone could aid research. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the procedural validity of telephone administration of the sensitivity to punishment/sensitivity to reward questionnaire (SPSRQ) as a measure of BIS and BAS activity (by means of its two scales: the sensitivity to punishment {[}SP] scale and the sensitivity to reward {[}SR] scale). Methods: A total of 231 participants were assessed with the SPSRQ twice (over the telephone and in a self-administered format). Intraclass correlation coefficients and kappa indices were calculated. Additionally, possible differences between the mean scores obtained with the two assessment procedures and internal consistency were explored. Results: Telephone and self-assessment of BIS and BAS, by means of the SPSRQ, provided similar results, supporting the procedural validity of telephone administration. A slight but statistically significant tendency (estimated betha = 0.62; 95\% Cl, 0.33-0.92; p < 0.001) toward lower scores was observed for the telephone-administered SP scale and for the interaction ``first or second assessment/telephone or self-administered SPSRQ{''} for the SR scale (p = 0.023).

But until now, on-farm studies on fattening bulls have been limited. A feasible, reliable methodology for assessing responses of bulls to humans Would be helpful for large scale surveys on this topic. Measuring avoidance distance at the feeding place (ADF) to assess animals' relationship to humans was shown to be a feasible and stable measure in dairy cow herds. So, the main objective of this study was to investigate reliability aspects of measuring avoidance distance at the feeding place towards an unknown experimenter on bull fattening farms. Moreover, we were interested in the potential confounding factor age of animals, and, on a preliminary level, a possible relationship of responsiveness of bulls to farmers' attitudes. With regard to reliability, between-experimenter repeatability - the repeatability of ADF when carried out by different experimenters within short time - was evaluated by two experimenters in a balanced order with 602 fattening bulls on 10 farms. The experimenter was both the stimulus person and the person collecting the data. Between-experimenter repeatability was analysed at an individual and at farm level. We recorded the median and mean values of avoidance distances {[}ADF median, ADF mean] per farm and the percentages of bulls accepting to be touched {[}ADF \% touch] or showing avoidance distances greater than 20 cm {[}ADF \% > 0.2 m]. Inter-observer reliability, based on individual observations recorded by an experimenter and an observer simultaneously, was tested on six farms. Farmers were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess their attitudes (behavioural beliefs and affective attitudes) towards interacting with bulls. Generally, inter-observer reliability for ADF was high (r(s) > 0.9, n = 288/297). At an individual level, moderate between-experimenter repeatability could be attained (r(s) = 0.6, n = 469). At farm level (n = 10), Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)) for between-experimenter repeatability ranged from >0.4 to 0.7. A low negative correlation was found between ADF and age at an individual level (r(s) = -0.14, P = 0.015, n = 320). Despite the rather low range of avoidance distances observed between farms, ADF correlated significantly with some of the farmers' attitudes. ADF was lower in case of farmers expressing more positive affective attitudes towards contacts with the animals (significantly so for the measures ADF mean and ADF \% > 0.2 m {[}P < 0.05]). In conclusion, the use of the avoidance distance test at the feeding place (ADF) is promising for assessing the responses of fattening bulls to humans due to its feasibility, reliability and sensitivity both at an individual and at farm level. Based on a limited number of farms, our first exploration of the relationships between farmers' attitudes and responses of bulls to humans in the home environment suggests possible links that require further investigations.

Boldness is defined as the tendency of an individual to take risks and be exploratory in novel contexts.

After such testing, individuals were tagged and returned to their lake of origin as part of a mark-recapture study testing for the repeatability of individual differences in boldness. Here, we report strong and consistent individual differences in boldness within and across all 3 behavioral contexts. Additionally, we observed that at least some boldness behaviors were repeatable after a 1-3 month recapture period.

Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP), lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability estimates were 0,65,0.40,0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively. Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach tests (W(35) - 0.56, P < 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray, striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were assessed. Cows showed the greatest reactivity response to the water spray compared to the striped boards (U(1) - 56, P < 0.001) and flashing light (U(1) - 66, P < 0.001). No statistically significant agreement existed between the novel stimuli reactivity and investigatory responses with the AP flight response scores. In conclusion, consistency over time was demonstrated over a relatively short period for the AP test and consistency between human approach situations was shown, however, consistency between human and novel situations was not found.

It is important that the staff in these welfare centres can reliably assess the behavioural characteristics of the dogs so that they can be rehomed to the most appropriate environment and the owners can be made aware of what to expect. There have been very few studies which have assessed the reliability of the assessment of dogs' behavioural responses; therefore this study was conducted to assess the inter-rater reproducibility and intra-rater repeatability of the assessment of behavioural responses of dogs by staff at a UK dog welfare charity. Forty members of staff at Dogs Trust, a UK dog welfare charity, were asked to assess 20 dogs based on the dogs' behaviour recorded on video. They were then asked to repeat these assessments 2 months after they had completed the first assessments using the same video. The data were then analysed for inter-rater reproducibility and intra-rater repeatability using the weighted kappa statistic. It wits found that there was a moderate level of agreement between staff in their assessment of the dogs' behavioural responses to a person `approaching their kennel' and a poor to moderate level of agreement for behavioural responses to `general handling and grooming'. Additionally, there was only a low-level of agreement for many of the responses to a dog `meeting another dog' and this may have been due to the small number of dogs that were able to be assessed in this situation. The inter-rater reproducibility was greater when the analysis was restricted to those members of staff who had formal training or more than 8 years of experience. The intra-rater repeatability was generally moderate to high in all cases indicating it good consistency by members of staff over time. The current study shows that there is an overall moderate level of agreement amongst staff but as they gain experience and training their level of agreement tends to increase. This study also highlighted the need for the standardisation of the assessments currently used. It is important that staff are able to consistently identify behavioural characteristics of dogs in order to provide the best chance of a successful adoption. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These typical reactions, described as `behavioral syndromes' or `personalities,' appear to be heritable and therefore subject to selection. We studied behavioral syndromes in 36 male fowl living in 12 social groups and found that individuals behaved consistently over time. Furthermore, responses to different contexts (anti-predator, foraging, and territorial) were inter-correlated, suggesting that males exhibited comparable behavioral traits in these functionally distinct situations. We subsequently isolated the same roosters and conducted tests in a `virtual environment,' using high-resolution digital video sequences to simulate the anti-predator, foraging, and territorial contexts that they had experienced outdoors. Under these controlled conditions, repeatability persisted but individual responses to the three classes of stimuli failed to predict one another. These were instead context-specific. In particular, production of each type of vocal signal was independent, implying that calls in the repertoire are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Our results show that extrinsic factors, such as social position, can be responsible for the appearance of traits that could readily be mistaken for the product of endogenous characters.","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01568.x","0179-1613",NA,"ISI:000260823000002",NA,"Nelson, Ximena/0000-0003-4301-2928","Wilson, David/E-2869-2010 ",NA,657,57,373,"#000000",NA,""

Here we describe (1) the extent and repeatability of inter-individual variation in adrenocortical responses and (2) its relationship to sex-specific phenotypic quality, such as song duration and frequency and timing of egg laying. We measured adrenocortical responses to a standardized stressor in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) at two life history stages: similar to day 16 (nestlings) and 3 months of age (sexually mature adults). Subsequently, we assessed phenotypic (reproductive) quality of all individuals as adults. Marked inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical response was seen in both sexes and ages, e.g., stress-induced corticosterone ranged from 2.2 to 62.5 ng/mL in nestlings and 5.0-64.0 ng/mL in adults. We found sex differences in (a) inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical response, (b) repeatability, and (c) relationships between corticosterone levels and phenotypic quality. In males, variation in nestling corticosterone was weakly but positively correlated with brood size and negatively correlated with nestling mass (though this relationship was dependent on one individual). There was no significant correlation of adrenocortical responses between two stages in males and adult phenotypic quality was significantly correlated only with adult corticosterone levels. In contrast, in females there was no relationship between nestling corticosterone and brood size or mass but adrenocortical response was repeatable between two stages (r(2) =0.413). Phenotypic quality of adult females was correlated with nestling baseline and adrenocortical response. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In fish, nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual builders, but little is known about how consistent individual differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from four populations in mid-Wales, U.K., to complete three consecutive nests under standardized laboratory conditions. We quantified a number of structural components and design characteristics of nests and estimated repeatability (r) of these traits. Within populations, the number of threads used, the area of the nest and the mass of substrate deposited on top of the nest were all repeatable within males (0.39 < r < 0.51), showing that individual male three-spined sticklebacks differed consistently in the size and composition of the nests they produced. Our data support the hypothesis that nest characteristics may reveal important information about the quality of individual males, and that they may, at least in part, be under genetic control. We discuss these findings in the context of the evolution of nest characteristics in sticklebacks and other species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Methods: We assessed the psychometric properties of the 8-item Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS) in a sample of 58 methadone maintenance patients. Results: Internal consistency was modest, but similar to the original value (alpha = 0.62), and test-retest correlation at four months follow-up was moderately encouraging for a short instrument such as this (n = 31, test retest intraclass correlation = 0.58), and change at the mean level was minimal, but marginally significant (from an average of 3.3 to 3.8, p = 0.06). Analyses of nurse ratings of patients' behaviour at the clinic showed that SAPAS was significantly correlated with nurse ratings of externalizing behaviour (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), and Global Assessment of Functioning (r = -0.36, p = 0.006), but unrelated to intoxication (r = 0.02, NS), or withdrawal (r = 0.20, NS). Conclusion: There is evidence that the SAPAS is a modestly valid and relatively reliable brief screening measure of personality disorders in patients with ongoing substance abuse undergoing methadone maintenance. It can be used in situations where limited resources are available, and researchers or others wish to get an impression of the degree of personality pathology in a clinical population, as well as for screening purposes.","10.1186/1471-244X-8-7","1471-244X",NA,"ISI:000253963300001","7","Hesse, Morten/0000-0002-6849-6554","Hesse, Morten/A-6925-2008 ",NA,660,554,371,"#000000",NA,""

For example, it offers an explanation for the continued existence of heritable genetic variation in sexually selected male traits. In this study, we first tested the suitability of association tests for assessing female mate preferences in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Sand goby females showed sexually motivated association preferences that were repeatable and corresponded to actual mating decisions. We then compared the correlation between the preferences of two different females presented to the same male pair with the correlation between preferences of single females tested twice. We found a weak correlation between preferences in the two-female treatment, while the correspondence between preferences was much higher for the single-female treatment. These results are in accordance with the possibility that sand goby females show genetically based, individual differences in mate preferences.

One important step in these studies is to estimate the repeatability of temperament traits, by replicating measures of an animal's behavioural or physiological reactions to a novel or stressful situation. When studies are performed in the field, several factors can affect repeatability estimates: (1) micro-environmental conditions prior to or during a test may affect the measured behaviour, and spatial heterogeneity in predation risk within the habitat of a population may affect repeatability; (2) a decrease over time in the strength of behavioural reactions as a result of habituation may bias repeatability; and (3) individuals may differ in their habituation. In this study we used a linear mixed-model approach to test for the occurrence of interindividual variation in behavioural reaction and habituation of eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, to a hole-board test and a handling bag test. We found high intraindividual consistency for the behaviours recorded both in the hole-board and handling bag tests; four temperament traits could be considered (i.e. activity/exploration, reaction to stress, emotionality and docility). Given that we found no phenotypic variation in habituation, chipmunks seem to show a behavioural carryover in activity/exploration and docility, which could have consequences for the evolutionary potential of habituation to novelty.
