Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) concept predicts that individuals with
   high baseline metabolic rates demonstrate high boldness, aggressiveness,
   and activity, especially in food acquisition, with associated relatively
   greater energy requirements. In fishes, these behaviors may increase
   individual vulnerability to angling. To test the predictions of the POLS
   concept, we quantified individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and
   boldness in both wild-caught and hatchery-reared Eurasian perch (Perca
   fluviatilis). We found both SMR and boldness to be repeatable traits but
   detected no correlation between them. Individual vulnerability to
   angling was assessed in the hatchery-reared perch, but we found no
   difference in boldness or SMR between vulnerable and nonvulnerable
   perch. Wild-caught perch were ice fished using either natural or
   artificial bait, and we observed no differences in boldness or SMR with
   respect to bait type or capture order. Our findings do not support the
   predictions of the POLS concept and, consistent with earlier studies in
   perch, suggest that angling may not drive selection against boldness in
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{Modularity is an important topological attribute for functional brain
   networks. Recent human fMRI studies have reported that modularity of
   functional networks varies not only across individuals being related to
   demographics and cognitive performance, but also within individuals
   co-occurring with fluctuations in network properties of functional
   connectivity, estimated over short time intervals. However,
   characteristics of these time-resolved functional networks during
   periods of high and low modularity have remained largely unexplored. In
   this study we investigate basic spatiotemporal properties of
   time-resolved networks in the high and low modularity periods during
   rest, with a particular focus on their spatial connectivity patterns,
   temporal homogeneity and test-retest reliability. We show that spatial
   connectivity patterns of time-resolved networks in the high and low
   modularity periods are represented by increased and decreased
   dissociation of the default mode network module from task-positive
   network modules, respectively. We also find that the instances of
   time-resolved functional connectivity sampled from within the high
   (respectively, low) modularity period are relatively homogeneous
   (respectively, heterogeneous) over time, indicating that during the low
   modularity period the default mode network interacts with other networks
   in a variable manner. We confirmed that the occurrence of the high and
   low modularity periods varies across individuals with moderate
   inter-session test-retest reliability and that it is correlated with
   previously-reported individual differences in the modularity of
   functional connectivity estimated over longer timescales. Our findings
   illustrate how time-resolved functional networks are spatiotemporally
   organized during periods of high and low modularity, allowing one to
   trace individual differences in long-timescale modularity to the
   variable occurrence of network configurations at shorter timescales.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the temporal and situational consistency of personality
   traits in adult dairy cattle}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent
   individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important
   factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity.
   However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they
   might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day
   social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term
   temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated
   in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of
   lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a
   novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of
   behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven
   in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter
   reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object
   contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object
   contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s =
   0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to
   investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test
   parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test
   results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition
   changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two
   personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified
   by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between
   the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P =
   0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support
   the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and
   they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group
   situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results
   implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on
   individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group
   behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social
   environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day
   situations.}},

Title = {{Effects of acclimatisation on behavioural repeatability in two behaviour
   assays of the guppy Poecilia reticulata}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Establishing behavioural repeatability is important in animal
   personality research; however, a range of factors can influence
   repeatability. Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is
   important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of
   behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal
   behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between
   observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is
   widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time
   varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated
   the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and
   emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared
   guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous
   findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after
   2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish
   exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability;
   however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting
   that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses
   irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent
   across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact
   the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered
   carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate
   appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to
   commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is
   individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and
   across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural
   differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal
   personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed
   multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent
   differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated
   observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise
   stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a
   range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two
   populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence
   behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity
   levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of
   acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation
   time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be
   properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality
   research.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{211-220}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Tree size censusing is essential for evaluations of trees and forests,
   but traditional field surveys are both time- and labor-intensive. Here,
   we discuss the use of panoramic 360-degree street views available on the
   Internet for censusing of roadside trees in urban regions. Use of
   scale-independent, fixed-sized street objects as recalibrating meters in
   tandem with imagery software enabled street-view images to be used
   effectively in the remote measurement of diameter at breast height
   (DBH), tree height, underbranch height, and canopy projection size.
   Comparison of four independent meters determined that stem
   limewhite-related meters (used for tree disease and bark-freeze injury
   control; usually 1.3 in height throughout China) had greater precision
   than road curb height, lane width, and traffic line width meters. The
   limewhite meter's precision was slightly lower than those of the meters
   in combination (i.e., when at least three of the abovementioned meters
   were used for the same tree measurement), but no statistically
   significant differences were detected between the limewhite and combined
   meters (p > 0.05). In contrast, the road curb height, traffic line
   width, and lane width meters all had significantly lower precision. The
   highest levels of precision were 92\%, 87\%, and 80\% for DBH, height
   (tree height and underbranch height), and tree canopy size measurements,
   respectively. Empirical recalibration of the image-based measurements
   did not improve data precision with reference to field surveys (p >
   0.05). Moreover, similar results were obtained regardless of individual
   users, and repeatability for DBH measurements (r(2) > 0.92), and maximum
   differences among individual users were 0.6-1.9 cm for DBH (averaged at
   22 cm) and 8-50 cm for underbranch height (mean value at 8 m). Labor
   costs and time needed for this approach were one-thirtieth to one-tenth
   those required for field surveys. Thus, the use of street-view images
   represents a more resourceful approach to assess forest ecological
   services.}},

Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{8-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Dairy cows' emotional state can sometimes be inferred from their
   behaviour, for example previous studies have suggested that those
   passing a novel person to the right are more likely to be anxious than
   those passing to the left. We undertook two studies of cow behaviour as
   they passed a novel person, to validate these behaviours as emotional
   indicators, in addition to determining correlations to other indices of
   emotional state. Cows passing to the right were more likely to have a
   raised or tucked tail, sniff the ground, walk slowly and a faster exit
   when put in a crush, compared with those passing to the left, which had
   their ears held forwards. From a principal component analysis, it was
   determined that cows passing on the right side were also most likely to
   pass without turning their head towards the person, pass singly and
   defecate whilst passing. However, those passing to the left side were
   most likely to turn to look at the person and pass in pairs. Cows with
   high milk yields were more likely to pass on the right side.
   Measurements of side of passage were repeatable between experiments but
   those of ear position were not. It is concluded that side of passage
   past a person correlates with other behavioural indicators of the cow's
   emotional state, with those passing to the right (i.e. left eye/right
   brain hemisphere) apparently more anxious. Evidence was also provided
   that high yielding cows are more anxious, as assessed by right side
   passage. With further validation, side of passage past a person could be
   developed as a simple measure of emotional state in dairy cows that can
   be conducted under field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural and cognitive processes play important roles in mediating an
   individual's interactions with its environment. Yet, while there is a
   vast literature on repeatable individual differences in behaviour,
   relatively little is known about the repeatability of cognitive
   performance. To further our understanding of the evolution of cognition,
   we gathered 44 studies on individual performance of 25 species across
   six animal classes and used meta-analysis to assess whether cognitive
   performance is repeatable. We compared repeatability (R) in performance
   (1) on the same task presented at different times (temporal
   repeatability), and (2) on different tasks that measured the same
   putative cognitive ability (contextual repeatability). We also addressed
   whether R estimates were influenced by seven extrinsic factors
   (moderators): type of cognitive performance measurement, type of
   cognitive task, delay between tests, origin of the subjects,
   experimental context, taxonomic class and publication status. We found
   support for both temporal and contextual repeatability of cognitive
   performance, with mean R estimates ranging between 0.15 and 0.28.
   Repeatability estimates were mostly influenced by the type of cognitive
   performance measures and publication status. Our findings highlight the
   widespread occurrence of consistent inter-individual variation in
   cognition across a range of taxa which, like behaviour, may be
   associated with fitness outcomes.

Abstract = {{Natural selection can act on between-individual variation in cognitive
   abilities, yet evolutionary responses depend on the presence of
   underlying genetic variation. It is, therefore, crucial to determine the
   relative extent of genetic versus environmental control of these
   among-individual differences in cognitive traits to understand their
   causes and evolutionary potential. We investigated heritability of
   associative learning performance and of a cognitive judgement bias
   (optimism), as well as their covariation, in a captive pedigree-bred
   population of red junglefowl (Gallus gallus, n. 300 chicks over 5
   years). We analysed performance in discriminative and reversal learning
   (two facets of associative learning), and cognitive judgement bias, by
   conducting animal models to disentangle genetic from environmental
   contributions. We demonstrate moderate heritability for reversal
   learning, and weak to no heritability for optimism and discriminative
   learning, respectively. The two facets of associative learning were
   weakly negatively correlated, consistent with hypothesized trade-offs
   underpinning individual cognitive styles. Reversal, but not
   discriminative learning performance, was associated with judgement bias;
   less optimistic individuals reversed a previously learnt association
   faster. Together these results indicate that genetic and environmental
   contributions differ among traits. While modular models of cognitive
   abilities predict a lack of common genetic control for different
   cognitive traits, further investigation is required to fully ascertain
   the degree of covariation between a broader range of cognitive traits

Abstract = {{Background: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy is the most widely
   used instrument to measure empathy in the doctor-patient relationship.
   This work pursued cultural adaptation and validation of the original
   scale, in its health professions version (JSE-HP), for medical students
   who participate in an Early Clerkship Immersion Programme of a Spanish
   university.
   Methods: The questionnaire was replied by 506 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th year
   medical students from Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid, in 2014
   and 2016. Internal consistency was analysed by means of Cronbach's
   alpha, and reliability by means of test-retest using the intraclass
   correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman method. The construct
   validity was checked by means of confirmatory factor analysis and
   association with other empathy-related variables. Criterion validity was
   compared using Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index.
   Results: Cronbach's alpha was 0.82 (range 0.80-0.85). Item-total score
   correlations were positive and significant (median 0.45, p < 0.01). The
   test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.68 (0.42-0.82). The
   factor analysis confirmed the three original factors: ``perspective
   taking{''}, ``compassionate care{''} and ``standing in the patient's
   shoes{''}. Women and students who preferred specialities focused on
   persons obtained the best scores. The JSE-HP scores were positively
   correlated with Interpersonal Reactivity Index, personality traits were
   associated with empathy, clinical interview skills and Objective
   Structured Clinical Examinations.
   Conclusion: The results support the validity and reliability of JSE-HP
   applied to Spanish medical students.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental perspectives of animal personality enhance our
   understanding of how personality structure changes in relation to life

   personality differences can be solely attributed to environmental
   factors. Here, I investigated the presence of personality within a
   species of clonal gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, at different
   developmental stages. For juveniles and adult geckos, I measured
   exploration (reaction to a novel situation) and boldness (risk-prone
   tendency) and evaluated repeatability and correlation of these
   behavioural traits. Each gecko exhibited different exploration and
   boldness with significant repeatability through time but no correlation
   between these behavioural traits. Small juveniles were composed of only
   bold and low explorative individuals but large juveniles and adults were
   composed of various personality type individuals. These results
   demonstrate that subject geckos have a similar personality structure
   across life stages and that exploration and boldness are independent
   personality without forming behavioural syndrome structure. Biased
   composition of personality type between life stages suggests that
   appearance of different personality type individuals during an early
   ontogenetic stage generates personality variation within the clonal
   population. This study provides developmental insight about personality
   structure and its composition in clonal animals living in the wild.}},

   OBJECTIVE To characterize the abnormal features of the cornea in
   patients with DS and compare these with a control group.
   DESIGN, SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter case-control study at
   Vissum Alicante, Alicante, Spain, and the Ophthalmology and Pediatric
   Department, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. Data collection took place
   between May 2013 and May 2016. Data were analyzed between June 2016 and
   August 2016. The study included 321eyes of 217 participants from 2
   groups: 112 participants in the DS group and 105 healthy participants in
   the control group.
   INTERVENTIONS Patients were evaluated using Placido disc/Scheimpflug
   camera topographer (Sirius. CSO). Visual, refractive and anterior, and
   posterior corneal characteristics were assessed and compared in both
   groups.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Keratoconus diagnosis. Incidence of corneal
   morphologic irregularities similar to keratoconus in patients with DS.
   RESULTS In the DS group, mean (SD) age was 14.88 (15.76) years, 54
   (48\%) were women, 66 (59\%) were white, and 46 (41\%) were Arab. In the
   control group, mean (SD) age was 40.29 (14.66) years, 54 (51\%) were
   women, and all were white. Clinical assessment of corneal topography
   showed that 71.3\% (95\% CI, 45.2-97.4) of patients in the DS group
   showed characteristics compatible with keratoconus. Differences were
   found in steepest keratometry of 47.35 diopters (D) in patients with OS
   vs 43.70 D in control individuals (difference, 3.65 0; 95\% CI,
   3.23-4.35 D; P <.001) and in corneal pachymetry of 503 mu m in patients
   with DS vs 545 mu m in control individuals (difference, 42 mu m; 95\%
   CI, 38.8-56.7 mu m; P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with DS have steeper and thinner
   corneas and more corneal aberrations than those without genetic
   alterations and normal corneas. The findings suggest a detailed corneal
   study should be considered in such patients to detect keratoconus and
   implement treatment as appropriate to try to avoid serious visual
   impairment in this group of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency within and across behaviours (animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome, respectively) has been vigorously studied in
   the last decade, leading to the emergence of animal personality
   research. It has been proposed recently that not only mean behaviour
   (behavioural type), but the environmentally induced behavioural change
   (behavioural plasticity) might also differ between individuals within
   populations. While case studies presenting between-individual variation
   in behavioural plasticity have started to accumulate, the mechanisms
   behind its emergence are virtually unknown. We have recently
   demonstrated that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli during
   ontogeny are necessary for the development of animal personality and
   behavioural syndromes. However, it is unknown whether between-individual
   variation in behavioural plasticity is hard-wired or induced. Here, we
   tested whether experience with predation during development affected
   predator-induced behavioural plasticity in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We
   ran a common garden experiment with two ontogenetic predation
   treatments: tadpoles developed from hatching in either the presence or
   absence of olfactory predator stimuli. Then, we assayed all tadpoles
   repeatedly for activity and risk-taking both in the absence and presence
   of olfactory predator stimuli. We found that (a) between-individual
   variation in predator-induced behavioural plasticity was present only in
   the group that developed in the presence of olfactory stimuli from
   predators and (b) previous experience with predatory stimuli resulted in
   lower plastic response at the group level. The latter pattern resulted
   from increased between-individual variation and not from universally
   lower individual responses. We also found that experience with predation
   during development increased the predictability (i.e. decreased the
   within-individual variation unrelated to environmental change) of
   activity, but not risk-taking. In line with this, tadpoles developing
   under perceived predatory risk expressed their activity with higher
   repeatability. We suggest that ecologically relevant environmental
   stimuli are not only fundamental for the development of animal
   personality and behavioural syndromes, but also for individual variation
   in behavioural plasticity. Thus, experience is of central importance for
   the emergence of individual behavioural variation at many levels.}},

Volume = {{460}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In epidemiological and clinical studies, whole blood assay
   (WBA) has been used as a measure to characterize inter-individual
   differences in the cytokine response of individuals exposed to
   inflammatory agents, such as endotoxins. Several short-time
   repeatability studies have shown stable cytokine levels in individuals
   over periods of days, weeks or months, but little is known about the
   long-term stability of cytokine reactivity.
   Methods: We studied cytokine response levels in LPS-stimulated whole
   blood in a cohort of 193 farmers and agricultural industry workers at
   two time points with a five-year interval.
   Results: IL-10 and IL-1 beta responses measured with a five-year time
   interval showed a weak positive correlation (r = 0.22 and 0.27,
   respectively), whereas no correlation was observed for TNF alpha (r =
   0.06). Cytokine reactivity measured repeatedly at the same time point
   showed high correlations (IL-10 r = 0.80, IL-1 beta r = 0.53 and TNF
   alpha r = 0.74), suggesting that the observed weak correlations over
   time are reflective of actual variations in cytokine reactivity over
   time.
   Conclusions: Repeatability of ex vivo cytokine reactivity showed to be
   differential for the measured cytokines, being more stable for IL-10 and
   IL-1 beta than for TNF alpha. However, in general, repeatability of ex
   vivo cytokine reactivity was weak, reflecting that cytokine reactivity
   can mostly be explained by (short term) intra-individual (immunological)
   or time varying environmental factors and less by genetic or other
   time-invariant factors. Therefore, WBA should be regarded as a viable
   tool to study relationships with current health status and exposure, and
   only partially as a predictor for a future response.}},

Abstract = {{Faced with rapid environmental changes, individuals may express
   different magnitude and plasticity in their response to a given

   present study, we repeatedly captured individual roe deer (Capreolus
   capreolus) from two wild populations in Sweden exposed to differing
   levels of predation pressure and measured plasma concentrations of
   stress-induced cortisol and behavioral docility. While controlling for
   the marked effects of habituation, we found clear between-population
   differences in the stress-induced cortisol response. Roe deer living in
   the area that was recently recolonized by lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolves
   (Canis lupus) expressed cortisol levels that were around 30\% higher
   than roe deer in the human-dominated landscape free of large carnivores.
   In addition, for the first time to our knowledge, we investigated the
   stress-induced cortisol response in free-ranging newborn fawns and found
   no evidence for hypo-responsiveness during early life in this species.
   Indeed, stress-induced cortisol levels were of similar magnitude and
   differed between populations to a similar extent in both neonates and
   adults. Finally, at an individual level, we found that both cortisol and
   docility levels were strongly repeatable, and weakly negatively
   inter-correlated, suggesting that individuals differed consistently in

Abstract = {{Studies of transmission biases in social learning have greatly informed
   our understanding of how behaviour patterns may diffuse through animal
   populations, yet within-species inter-individual variation in social
   information use has received little attention and remains poorly
   understood. We have addressed this question by examining individual
   performances across multiple experiments with the same population of
   primates. We compiled a dataset spanning 16 social learning studies (26
   experimental conditions) carried out at the same study site over a
   12-year period, incorporating a total of 167 chimpanzees. We applied a
   binary scoring system to code each participant's performance in each
   study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social
   information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not
   (Social Information Score-'SIS'). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models
   were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences
   influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age,
   prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of
   repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was
   accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual
   differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of
   chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females
   were, depending on their rearing history, 15-24\% more likely to use
   social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However,
   there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience,

   trait. Our study offers a novel, transferable method for the study of
   individual differences in social learning.}},

Abstract = {{Studies about personalities in wild animals usually focus on five
   categories of behavioral traits that do not easily accommodate all
   aspects of parental care, a class of behaviors with direct consequence
   to reproductive success. Parental care can vary consistently between
   individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the
   consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding
   seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern
   Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest
   defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these
   first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according
   to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and
   aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except
   exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We
   also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an
   important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can
   arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a
   consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that,
   depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent,
   suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care
   allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest
   defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed
   the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the
   mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications
   of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking
   parenting styles to fitness in swallow species.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses to novel situations often vary and can belong to a

   measure exploratory behavior of individual fish in an open field test
   over five weeks. We quantified the stationary time, average swimming

Abstract = {{Inter-individual variation in behavioural traits has important
   implications for evolutionary and ecological processes. Site fidelity,
   where individuals consistently use the same foraging site, is common
   among marine predators. Sex differences in foraging are also well
   studied in marine vertebrates, but the extent to which consistent
   inter-individual differences in foraging vary between the sexes is
   poorly known. Here we quantified the effects of sex on individual
   foraging site fidelity (IFSF), both within and between years, in
   chick-brooding Campbell albatross Thalassarche impavida. Using
   bird-borne global positioning system loggers, we calculated route
   fidelity (nearest-neighbour distance), repeatability of site fidelity
   (terminal latitude and longitude), and foraging effort (total distance
   travelled and trip duration) during 2 to 10 repeat trips. Overall,
   Campbell albatrosses showed a high degree of site fidelity. Birds
   travelled to similar sites not only within the same year, but also
   between 2 consecutive years, suggesting that the within-year consistency
   is not simply in response to short-term patches of food. Moreover,
   within the same year, we found differences in terms of IFSF between the
   sexes. Females that foraged closer to the colony in neritic and shelf
   waters were more likely to follow similar routes on repeated foraging
   trips and were more consistent in their foraging effort than males.
   Males that foraged further offshore in pelagic waters had more
   repeatable foraging longitudes than females. Our study provides further
   evidence of the importance of IFSF among marine vertebrates. However, it
   also reveals that the strength of such specialisations may vary with
   sex.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within the same population generally differ among each other
   not only in their behavioral traits but also in their level of
   behavioral plasticity (i.e., in their propensity to modify their
   behavior in response to changing conditions). If the proximate factors
   underlying individual differences in behavioral plasticity were the same
   for any measure of plasticity, as commonly assumed, one would expect
   plasticity to be repeatable across behaviors and contexts. However, this
   assumption remains largely untested. Here, we conducted an experiment
   with sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) whose behavioral plasticity
   was estimated both as the change in their personality traits or mating
   behavior across a social gradient and using their performance on a
   reversal-learning task. We found that the correlations between pairwise
   measures of plasticity were weak and non-significant, thus indicating
   that the most plastic individuals were not the same in all the tests.
   This finding might arise because either individuals adjust the magnitude
   of their behavioral responses depending on the benefits of plasticity,
   and/or individuals expressing high behavioral plasticity in one context
   are limited by neural and/or physiological constraints in the amount of
   plasticity they can express in other contexts. Because the repeatability
   of behavioral plasticity may have important evolutionary consequences,
   additional studies are needed to assess the importance of trade-offs
   between conflicting selection pressures on the maintenance of
   intra-individual variation in behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Phenolic acids represent one third of the total phenolic compounds in
   extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and contribute greatly to the biological
   and sensory properties of EVOO. In the present research, an analytical
   method based on supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with single
   quadrupole mass spectrometry (SFC-MS) was developed for the analysis of
   phenolic acids in EVOOs. The chromatographic and MS conditions were
   optimized in terms of selectivity, peak shape and sensitivity.
   Satisfactory separation of 12 phenolic acids was achieved within 20 min
   on a Platisil CN column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) using 7\% (v/v) water
   and 0.5\% (v/v) formic acid in MeOH as mobile phase additives at the
   backpressure of 140 bar and temperature of 60 degrees C. The developed
   method was validated by evaluating the linearity, sensitivity,
   repeatability, intermediate precision and accuracy. The limits of
   detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) of the SFC-MS
   method for phenolic acids ranged from 0.03 to 5.00 mu g/mL and 0.08 to
   15.0 mu g/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for
   intraday and interday precision were lower than 9.91\% and the
   recoveries ranged from 80.2 to 117\% and 80.9 to 118\% for low-level and
   high-level concentrations of standards spiked in olive oil,
   respectively. Compared to an HPLC method, the SFC method was about three
   times faster and provided better selectivity. Finally, the SFC-MS method
   was successfully employed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic
   acids in EVOOs. Differences in individual and total phenolic acid
   contents were observed between six varieties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

   Top-down control was present and was generally stronger at increased

   be able to adequately describe the sweating capacity or ability to
   control the body temperature of an individual. Vaginal temperature
   increased as THI increased, with approximately 1 h lag time in the
   animal's response. Vaginal temperature (-0.047 degrees C, P = 0.015) and
   sweating rate were lower (-5.49 +/- 2.12 g/(m(2).h), P < 0.01) for
   heifers that demonstrated a calmer behavior in the chute. Animals with
   shorter, smoother hair coats had significantly lower vaginal
   temperatures when compared to animals with longer hair coats (P < 0.01).
   Also, heavier heifers in this study maintained lower (P < 0.0001)
   vaginal temperature than the lighter heifers. Our results showed that
   hair coat, temperament, and weight influenced vaginal temperature
   regulation.}},

Title = {{Mind the trap: large-scale field experiment shows that trappability is
   not a proxy for personality}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{101-112}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural tendencies vary consistently among individuals and this
   variation is known as personality. Previous studies have found that
   personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests
   predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the
   nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only
   within single species and never across environments. This is problematic
   because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between
   seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link
   because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy
   for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this
   would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term
   capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we
   designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and
   trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct
   forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189
   deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes
   gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland
   jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews,
   Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target
   species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality
   traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore,
   trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap
   happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the
   trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used
   as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animals living in groups can show substantial variation in social traits
   and this affects their social organization. However, as the specific
   mechanisms driving this organization are difficult to identify in
   already organized groups typically found in the wild, the contribution
   of interindividual variation to group level behaviour remains enigmatic.
   Here, we present results of an experiment to create and compare groups
   that vary in social organization, and study how individual behaviour
   varies between these groups. We iteratively sorted individuals between
   groups of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by ranking the groups according
   to their directional alignment and then mixing similar groups. Over the
   rounds of sorting the consistency of the group rankings increased,
   producing groups that varied significantly in key social behaviours such
   as collective activity and group cohesion. The repeatability of the
   underlying individual behaviour was then estimated by comparing the
   experimental data to simulations. At the level of basic locomotion,
   individuals in more coordinated groups displayed stronger interactions
   with the centre of the group, and weaker interactions with their nearest
   neighbours. We propose that this provides the basis for a passive
   phenotypic assortment mechanism that may explain the structures of
   social networks in the wild. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{People differ in how specifically they separate affective experiences

   Emotion-differentiation scores were computed using intraclass

   tendency to report feeling emotions one at a time explained elevated
   emotion differentiation in childhood. Importantly, two other mediators

Abstract = {{Animal invasions can be devastating for native species. Behavioral
   variation is known to influence animal invasions, yet comparatively less
   is known about how behavioral variation influences invasive-native
   species interactions. Here we examined how the mean and variance
   surrounding several behavioral traits in two sympatric species of
   praying mantis differ and how these behavioral types translate to actual
   prey capture success using the introduced European mantis, Mantis
   religiosa, and the native bordered mantis, Stagmomantis limbata. We
   assayed time spent in the open (risk proneness), response towards a
   novel prey, and voracity within a population of M. religiosa and S.
   limbata. We found that the native and invasive mantids displayed no
   differences in their average behavioral tendencies. The native exhibited
   significant levels of repeatability in voracity while the invasive did
   not. The lack of repeatability in the invasive appears to be driven by
   lower levels of among-individual variation in voracity. This may have
   evolutionary consequences for native S. limbata if it results in strong
   selection in native levels of mean and among-individual variation.
   Significant levels of among-individual differences were found in other
   behaviors (response to a novel prey and risk proneness) across species,
   suggesting less selection on invasive behavioral variation in these
   traits. Risk proneness and response towards a novel prey also formed a
   behavioral syndrome across species, yet neither behavior was correlated

   examine the ecological effects of behavioral variation of both invasive
   and native species to determine how that might impact invasive-native

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{100-106}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animals often show correlated suites of consistent behavioural traits,
   i.e., personality or behavioural syndromes. Does this conflict with
   potential phenotypic plasticity which should be adaptive for animals
   facing various contexts and situations? This fundamental question has
   been tested predominantly in studies which were done in non-breeding
   contexts and under laboratory conditions. Therefore, in the present
   study we examined the temporal stability of behavioural correlations in
   a breeding context and under natural conditions. We found that in the
   great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) females, the intensity of
   their nest defence formed a behavioural syndrome with two other traits:
   their aggression during handling (self-defence) and stress responses
   during handling (breath rate). This syndrome was stable across the
   nesting cycle: each of the three behavioural traits was highly
   statistically repeatable between egg and nestling stages and the traits
   were strongly correlated with each other during both the egg stage and
   the nestling stage. Despite this consistency (i.e., rank order between
   stages) the individual behaviours changed their absolute values
   significantly during the same period. This shows that stable behavioural
   syndromes might be based on behaviours that are themselves unstable.
   Thus, syndromes do not inevitably constrain phenotypic plasticity. We
   suggest that the observed behavioural syndrome is the product of
   interactions between behavioural and life history trade-offs and that
   crucial proximate mechanisms for the plasticity and correlations between
   individual behaviours are hormonally-regulated.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of the isoform A of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A), a
   mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing deamination of monoamine
   neurotransmitters, is useful in treatment of depression and anxiety
   disorders. {[}C-11]harmine, a MAO-A PET radioligand, has been used to
   study mood disorders and antidepressant treatment. However,
   {[}C-11]harmine binding test-retest characteristics have to date only
   been partially investigated. Furthermore, since MAO-A is ubiquitously
   expressed, no reference region is available, thus requiring arterial
   blood sampling during PET scanning. Here, we investigate {[}C-11]harmine
   binding measurements test-retest properties; assess effects of using a
   minimally invasive input function estimation on binding quantification
   and repeatability; and explore binding potentials estimation using a
   reference region-free approach.
   Quantification of {[}C-11]harmine distribution volume (V-T) via kinetic
   models and graphical analyses was compared based on absolute test-retest
   percent difference (TRPD), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and
   identifiability. The optimal procedure was also used with a
   simultaneously estimated input function in place of the measured curve.
   Lastly, an approach for binding potentials quantification in absence of
   a reference region was evaluated.
   {[}C-11]harmine V-T estimates quantified using arterial blood and
   kinetic modeling showed average absolute TRPD values of 7.7 to 15.6 \%,
   and ICC values between 0.56 and 0.86, across brain regions. Using
   simultaneous estimation (SIME) of input function resulted in V-T
   estimates close to those obtained using arterial input function (r =
   0.951, slope = 1.073, intercept = - 1.037), with numerically but not
   statistically higher test-retest difference (range 16.6 to 22.0 \%), but
   with overall poor ICC values, between 0.30 and 0.57.
   Prospective studies using {[}C-11]harmine are possible given its
   test-retest repeatability when binding is quantified using arterial
   blood. Results with SIME of input function show potential for
   simplifying data acquisition by replacing arterial catheterization with
   one arterial blood sample at 20 min post-injection. Estimation of
   {[}C-11]harmine binding potentials remains a challenge that warrants
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Temperament can be defined as a type of behavioral tendency
   that appears in a relatively stable manner in responses to various
   external stimuli over time. The aim of this study was to estimate
   genetic parameters for the records of temperament testing that are used
   to improve the temperament of Jeju crossbred (JejuxThoroughbred) horses.
   Methods: This study was conducted using 205 horses (101 females and 104
   males) produced between 2010 and 2015. The experimental animals were
   imprinted and tamed according to the Manual for Horse Taming and
   Evaluation for Therapeutic Riding Horses and evaluated according to the
   categories for temperament testing (gentleness, patience,
   aggressiveness, sensitivity, and friendliness) between 15 months and 18
   months of age. Each category was scored on a five-point linear scale.
   Genetic parameters for the test categories were analyzed using a
   multi-trait mixed model with repeated records. The ASReml program was
   used to analyze the data.
   Results: The heritability of gentleness, patience, aggressiveness,
   sensitivity and friendliness ranged from 0.08 to 0.53. The standard
   errors of estimated heritability ranged from 0.13 to 0.17. The test
   categories showed high genetic correlations with each other, ranging
   from 0.96 to 0.99 and high repeatability, ranging from 0.70 to 0.73.
   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the test categories
   had moderate heritability and high genetic correlations, but additional
   studies may be necessary to use the results for the improvement programs
   of the temperament of Jeju crossbred horses.}},

Abstract = {{The social context plays a decisive role in the formation of the
   academic self-concept (ASC) and has been widely studied as the
   big-fish-little-pond-effect (BFLPE). This effect describes that
   comparable talented students in high-achieving school settings have a

   settings. Past research has focused on students' domain-specific ASC,
   while little is known about the relation of achievement-related
   classroom compositions and the various facets of ASC. Additionally,
   BFLPE-research has been critiqued to build its theoretical frame on
   social comparison theory, without providing sufficient empirical
   support. To address this gap, we analyzed how the single student's
   social, criterial, absolute, and individual ASC relate to class-level
   achievement of 8th graders. Applying Multilevel Structural Equation
   Modeling (MLSEM) we found that all facets of ASC were significantly
   related to average-class achievement, while student's social ASC
   revealed the strongest associated. The results reveal explicitly that
   average-class achievement is strongly related to social comparison

Abstract = {{As quantitative measures derived from fiber tractography are
   increasingly being used to characterize the structural connectivity of
   the brain, it is important to establish their reproducibility. However,
   no such information is as yet available for global tractography. Here we
   provide the first comprehensive analysis of the reproducibility of
   streamline counts derived from global tractography as quantitative
   estimates of structural connectivity. In a sample of healthy young
   adults scanned twice within one week, within-session and between-session
   test-retest reproducibility was estimated for streamline counts of
   connections based on regions of the AAL atlas using the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement. We further
   evaluated the influence of the type of head-coil (12 versus 32 channels)
   and the number of reconstruction repetitions (reconstructing streamlines
   once or aggregated over ten repetitions). Factorial analyses
   demonstrated that reproducibility was significantly greater for
   within-than between-session reproducibility and significantly increased
   by aggregating streamline counts over ten reconstruction repetitions.
   Using a high-resolution head-coil incurred only small beneficial
   effects. Overall, ICC values were positively correlated with the
   streamline count of a connection. Additional analyses assessed the
   influence of different selection variants (defining fuzzy versus no
   fuzzy borders of the seed mask; selecting streamlines that end in versus
   pass through a seed) showing that an endpoint-based variant using fuzzy
   selection provides the best compromise between reproducibility and
   anatomical specificity. In sum, aggregating quantitative indices over
   repeated estimations and higher numbers of streamlines are important
   determinants of test-retest reproducibility. If these factors are taken
   into account, streamline counts derived from global tractography provide
   an adequately reproducible quantitative measure that can be used to
   gauge the structural connectivity of the brain in health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the growing evidence for the importance of developmental
   experiences shaping consistent individual differences in behaviour and
   physiology, the role of endocrine factors underlying the development and
   maintenance of such differences across multiple traits, remains poorly
   understood. Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of
   circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural
   and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the
   precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were
   experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks.
   Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social
   behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual
   maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor
   circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean
   trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape
   latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and
   repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching
   significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly
   caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among
   docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals
   compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to
   elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal
   personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and
   risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were
   unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural
   modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have
   organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality
   traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that
   not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive
   period for behavioural development.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibious fishes moving over land between aquatic habitats likely
   encounter abrupt changes in a number of environmental conditions,
   including salinity. This study characterized the 1) spatial
   heterogeneity in salinity in the mangrove forest habitat of the
   self-fertilizing, amphibious mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus),
   2) metabolic cost and behavioral response to acute exposure to novel
   salinity, and 3) repeatability of individual responses to acute changes
   in salinity. In mangrove habitats on Long Caye, Belize, salinity varied
   widely over short distances from 20.941.7 parts per thousand over a 90
   cm distance. In the lab, fish were exposed to an acute change in
   salinity of delta 10, 20, or 30 parts per thousand. Oxygen consumption
   significantly decreased in response to a 10 parts per thousand decrease
   in salinity and increased when salinity was elevated by 30 parts per
   thousand. Activity levels significantly increased with an increase in
   salinity (delta 20 and 30 parts per thousand). Individuals showed
   repeatable differences in both oxygen consumption rates and activity
   levels. Together, our data show that K. marmoratus is highly responsive
   to abrupt increases in salinity. Thus, movements made by K. marmoratus
   between temporary pools in the mangrove forest will acutely alter
   behavior and possibly metabolism, with many potential ecological
   consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Developmental Profile Inventory (DPI) was constructed to
   assess psychodynamic personality functioning by self-report. Method: On
   the basis of the frame of reference of the Development Profile interview
   method, a self-report was developed covering 3 domains, self,
   interpersonal functioning, and problem-solving strategies, which
   represent 6 maladaptive and 3 adaptive developmental levels of
   psychodynamic functioning. The DPI was administered to patients with
   personality disorders who were receiving psychotherapy (N = 179) and to
   normal controls (N = 228). Results: The internal reliabilities of the
   subscales were in general in the fair to good range in the patient
   sample, (alpha = 0.67 to 0.88, omega(h) = 0.52 to 0.87) and adequate to
   good in the healthy controls (alpha = 0.71 to 0.91, omega(h) = 0.71 to
   0.90). Mean item-rest correlations were adequate (0.30 to 0.50).
   Test-retest reliability was good (intraclass correlation = 0.73 to
   0.91). The hypothesized factorial structure of the DPI with 9 subscales
   organized in 3 clusters was partly confirmed by confirmatory factor
   analysis chi(2)/df = 2.37, root mean square error of approximation =
   0.060, root mean residual square = 0.078, and comparative fit index =
   0.630, with each factor showing over 80\% standardized loadings > 0.30,
   and at least 75\% loadings > 0.40. The DPI discriminated patients and
   healthy controls in a meaningful way. Correlations among the DPI and
   other self-report measures of global personality pathology and
   psychological complaints showed satisfactory convergent and discriminant
   validity. Conclusions: The DPI is a promising self-report measure for
   assessing both adaptive and maladaptive patterns of psychodynamic
   personality functioning. The appropriate initial psychometric properties
   justify proceeding with more formal tests of construct validity and
   predictive performance in broader mental health settings.}},

Abstract = {{The precision and the extent of behavioral thermoregulation are likely
   to provide fitness benefits to ectotherms. Yet the factors driving
   variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its
   usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are
   still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related
   species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species
   level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as
   the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One
   factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles
   typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion.
   Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes
   in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if
   T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ.
   Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of
   36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed
   individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be
   more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not
   significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the
   highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range:
   0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on
   T-set did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the
   major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual
   variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of T-set
   considerably more plausible.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat choice has broad repercussions for animals, but mechanisms
   influencing such choices are generally not understood. When conducting
   conservation translocations using captive-reared animals, elucidating
   mechanisms influencing habitat preference pre-release could inform
   rearing methods and post-release behavior. We raised 32 captive-born
   eastern box turtles (Terrapene earolina) for eight months-16 in
   naturalistic enriched enclosures and 16 in unenriched enclosures. We
   then let each turtle choose between environments simulating both rearing
   conditions in a novel enclosure to evaluate the hypothesis that rearing
   environment influences habitat selection. Preference for the enriched
   environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81,
   95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95\%
   CI: 0.62-0.98) turtles. Those that chose the enriched habitat (n = 27)
   did so in less than half the time (7 = 504.8 s, 95\% CI: 266.49-743.04)
   than those that selected the unenriched one (n = 5, X = 1339.0 s, 95\%
   CI: 783.84-1894.07, P = 0.009). Selection latency did not differ between
   rearing treatments (P = 0.871). We conducted a second experiment to
   clarify if preferences were based on familiarity or novelty by using the
   same enclosure, but we gave individuals a choice between the habitat
   representing their rearing condition and a novel object (empty tissue
   box). Preference for respective rearing environment was exhibited by
   enriched (selection probability = 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.98) and
   unenriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96)
   individuals. Selection latency did not differ based on side chosen (P =
   0.439) or rearing treatment (P = 0.764). Selection latency was
   repeatable by individuals (R = 0.47, 90\% CI = 0.24-0.71, P = 0.003),
   and this personality trait may be heritable since it was also repeatable
   by clutch mates (R = 0.36, 90\% CI = 0.03-0.62, P = 0.001). Preference
   for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles
   appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior
   experience. Housing this species in enriched enclosures should increase
   welfare. Moreover, our collective findings highlight the importance of
   evaluating how intrinsic effects could affect translocation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Structures such as nests and burrows are an essential component of many
   organisms' life-cycle and require a complex sequence of behaviours.
   Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be
   correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would
   (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into
   distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among
   functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these
   hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a
   solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata
   constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear
   series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined
   variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction
   (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length
   and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number
   of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We
   found a general decline in investment in cell construction and
   provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence
   for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little
   evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were
   positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r0.15), and traits were loosely
   organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual
   differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to
   that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly
   integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of
   independent evolutionary trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{The marine environment is filled with biotic and abiotic sounds. Some of
   these sounds predict important events that influence fitness while
   others are unimportant. Individuals can learn specific sound cues and
   `soundscapes' and use them for vital activities such as foraging,
   predator avoidance, communication and orientation. Most research with
   sounds in elasmobranchs has focused on hearing thresholds and
   attractiveness to sound sources, but very little is known about their
   abilities to learn about sounds, especially in benthic species. Here we
   investigated if juvenile Port Jackson sharks could learn to associate a
   musical stimulus with a food reward, discriminate between two distinct
   musical stimuli, and whether individual personality traits were linked
   to cognitive performance. Five out of eight sharks were successfully
   conditioned to associate a jazz song with a food reward delivered in a
   specific corner of the tank. We observed repeatable individual
   differences in activity and boldness in all eight sharks, but these
   personality traits were not linked to the learning performance assays we
   examined. These sharks were later trained in a discrimination task,
   where they had to distinguish between the same jazz and a novel
   classical music song, and swim to opposite corners of the tank according
   to the stimulus played. The sharks' performance to the jazz stimulus
   declined to chance levels in the discrimination task. Interestingly,
   some sharks developed a strong side bias to the right, which in some
   cases was not the correct side for the jazz stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a sub-cortical evoked potential
   in which a series of well-defined waves occur in the first 10 ms after
   the onset of an auditory stimulus. Wave V of the ABR, particularly wave
   V latency, has been shown to be remarkably stable over time in
   individual listeners. However, little attention has been paid to the
   reliability of wave I, which reflects auditory nerve activity. This ABR
   component has attracted interest recently, as wave I amplitude has been
   identified as a possible non-invasive measure of noise-induced cochlear
   synaptopathy. The current study aimed to determine whether ABR wave I
   amplitude has sufficient test-retest reliability to detect impaired
   auditory nerve function in an otherwise normal-hearing listener. Thirty
   normal-hearing females were tested, divided equally into low- and
   high-noise exposure groups. The stimulus was an 80 dB nHL click. ABR
   recordings were made from the ipsilateral mastoid and from the ear canal
   (using a tiptrode). Although there was some variability between
   listeners, wave I amplitude had high test-retest reliability, with an
   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) comparable to that for wave V
   amplitude. There were slight gains in reliability for wave I amplitude
   when recording from the ear canal (ICC of 0.88) compared to the mastoid
   (ICC of 0.85). The summating potential (SP) and ratio of SP to wave I
   were also quantified and found to be much less reliable than measures of
   wave I and V amplitude. Finally, we found no significant differences in
   the amplitude of any wave components between low- and high-noise
   exposure groups. We conclude that, if the other sources of
   between-subject variability can be controlled, wave I amplitude is
   sufficiently reliable to accurately characterize individual differences
   in auditory nerve function. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   broad externalizing and internalizing psychopathology measures. We found

Abstract = {{Life history theory predicts a trade-off between migration and residency
   where migration is favoured when it infers elevated fitness. Although
   migration to more favourable environments may offer higher growth rates,
   migrants often experience increased mortality due to predation. Here, we
   investigated mortality and migration behaviour of the North Sea houting
   (Coregonus oxyrinchus), an anadromous salmonid endemic to the Wadden
   Sea. We used acoustic telemetry to map the migration of the only
   remaining indigenous population by applying stationary hydrophones
   combined with manual tracking. Data suggested a total mortality of 26\%,
   with 30\% of the total mortality attributed to predation by great
   cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), highlighting that North Sea
   houting conservation could be jeopardised by increased cormorant
   predation. Risk of cormorant predation was size-dependent, with smaller
   fish suffering higher risk of predation. The study found North Sea
   houting to exhibit disparate migration strategies and identified a
   lentic area in the estuary as an important habitat. Two newly
   established artificial lakes within the river system significantly
   reduced the migration speeds, possibly indicating constrained navigation
   through the lakes. The migration into the Wadden Sea correlated with
   temperature perhaps indicating osmoregulatory constraints of sea entry.
   Unlike many salmonid species, migration occurred both day and night.
   Moreover, fish exhibited repeatable individual differences in diel
   activity patterns, suggesting that individuals differ consistently in
   their migratory activity throughout the 24-hr period. Our study provides
   novel information on salmonid migration, which is crucial for the
   development of science-based conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Observed phenological changes can be explained either by individual
   phenotypic plasticity or by evolutionary changes, but there is more
   evidence pointing towards phenotypic plasticity to explain the mechanism
   behind changes in bird phenology. However, most studies on phenology
   have been conducted on insectivorous bird species for which breeding is
   closely tied to temperature and insect emergence. In this study, we
   examined the consequences of climatic conditions on the nesting
   phenology of temperate breeding Canada Geese Branta canadensis maxima,
   which rely on a continuous food supply, during a 14-year period
   (2003-16). We determined whether laying dates were plastically adjusted
   to spring environmental conditions, and whether this adjustment resulted
   in a laying date advancement. We further estimated the strength and
   shape of selection acting on breeding timing, by looking at the effect
   of laying date on the relative number of young successfully hatched in a
   nest. We found that Geese plastically adjusted their laying date to
   spring maximum temperature (and not to precipitation or ice break-up),
   resulting in a 9-day advancement of laying date in the population for
   that period. Laying date was also moderately repeatable (r=0.23) and
   subject to directional selection, but stabilizing selection was
   negligible. We thus demonstrate how Canada Geese plastically adjust
   laying dates to temperature, which may further be beneficial to nesting
   success. Evolutionary change of laying date to selection related to
   climate change, however, is still possible.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of studies show that metabolic rates are usually repeatable
   at the individual level, although their repeatabilities tend to decline
   with time and to be strongly affected by physiological changes. Changes
   in individual repeatabilities may therefore affect putative differences
   between experimental groups or populations. This problem is particularly
   relevant to artificial selection experiments that apply the selection
   protocol at early life stages, running the risk of a poor correlation of
   the trait with itself throughout the life cycle of individuals.
   Moreover, significant physiological changes (e.g., induced by
   reproduction) may affect traits under selection and therefore their
   postreproductive differentiation between selected lines. Here, using a
   unique animal model-mice from four lines selected for <(V)over
   dot>O-2max during swimming in 25 degrees C water and four random-bred
   control (reference) lines-we analyzed the long-term consistency of
   aerobic capacity as well as postswim hypothermia in primiparous and
   nonreproducing females at 12, 25, and 29 wk of age. Our results show
   that significant between-line type divergence in <(V)over dot>O-2max and
   hypothermia persists over time and is only weakly affected by past
   reproduction. Furthermore, both traits are also repeatable within lines

Abstract = {{Background. Advances in 3D shape capture technology have made powerful
   shape analyses, such as geometric morphometrics, more feasible. While
   the highly accurate micro-computed tomography (mu CT) scanners have been
   the ``gold standard,{''} recent improvements in 3D surface scanners may
   make this technology a faster, portable, and cost-effective alternative.
   Several studies have already compared the two devices but all use
   relatively large specimens such as human crania. Here we perform shape
   analyses on Australia's smallest rodent to test whether a 3D scanner
   produces similar results to a mu CT scanner.
   Methods. We captured 19 delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus) crania
   with a mu CT scanner and a 3D scanner for geometric morphometrics. We
   ran multiple Procrustes ANOVAs to test how variation due to scan device
   compared to other sources such as biologically relevant variation and
   operator error. We quantified operator error as levels of variation and
   repeatability. Further, we tested if the two devices performed
   differently at classifying individuals based on sexual dimorphism.
   Finally, we inspected scatterplots of principal component analysis (PCA)
   scores for non-random patterns.
   Results. In all Procrustes ANOVAs, regardless of factors included,
   differences between individuals contributed the most to total variation.
   The PCA plots reflect this in how the individuals are dispersed.
   Including only the symmetric component of shape increased the biological
   signal relative to variation due to device and due to error. 3D scans
   showed a higher level of operator error as evidenced by a greater spread
   of their replicates on the PCA, a higher level of multivariate
   variation, and a lower repeatability score. However, the 3D scan and mu
   CT scan datasets performed identically in classifying individuals based
   on infra-specific patterns of sexual dimorphism.
   Discussion. Compared to mu CT scans, we find that even low resolution 3D
   scans of very small specimens are sufficiently accurate to classify
   infra-specific differences. We also make three recommendations for best
   use of low resolution data. First, we recommend that extreme caution
   should be taken when analyzing the asymmetric component of shape
   variation. Second, using 3D scans generates more random error due to
   increased landmarking difficulty, therefore users should be conservative
   in landmark choice and avoid multiple operators. Third, using 3D scans
   introduces a source of systematic error relative to mu CT scans,
   therefore we recommend not combining them when possible, especially in
   studies expecting little biological variation. Our findings support
   increased use of low resolution 3D scans for most morphological studies;
   they are likely also applicable to low resolution scans of large
   specimens made in a medical CT scanner. As most vertebrates are
   relatively small, we anticipate our results will bolster more
   researchers in designing affordable large scale studies on small
   specimens with 3D surface scanners.}},

Title = {{Recall Bias in Low Back Pain Among Workers Effects of Recall Period and
   Individual and Work-Related Factors}},
Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{E727-E733}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A prospective cohort study.
   Objective. The aim of the present study was first to compare monthly
   measurements of low back pain (LBP) with quarterly and yearly
   retrospective measurements of LBP, and second to investigate possible
   bias effects for recall bias of LBP.
   Summary of Background Data. LBP is a subjective experience often
   measured by a single rating of recalled pain over a certain time
   interval. However, retrospectively reported pain may be subject to
   recall bias.
   Methods. The agreement between monthly measurements of LBP and quarterly
   and yearly retrospective measurements of LBP was evaluated by Spearman
   rank order correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation
   coefficients, and Bland-Altman plots. Bias effects for recall bias were
   investigated by a linear regression model.
   Results. There were no statistical significant differences in mean
   values of monthly measurements of LBP compared with quarterly and yearly
   retrospective measurements of LBP on a group level. However, the
   Bland-Altman plots revealed that within individuals, the difference
   between monthly measurements of LBP and quarterly and yearly
   retrospective measurements of LBP was highly variable. For both
   quarterly and yearly recall, social support from colleagues and average
   LBP days were significantly associated with the recall bias.
   Conclusion. The agreement of pain recall among workers in the current
   study seems to be good on a group level, but both between and within
   individuals, the difference between monthly and quarterly and yearly
   retrospective measurements was quite high. Factors that impacted the
   recall bias were social support from colleagues and average LBP days
   over the recall period.}},

Abstract = {{Although consistent behavioural differences between individuals (i.e.
   personality variation) are now well established in animals, these
   differences are not always expressed when individuals interact in social
   groups. This can be key in important social dynamics such as leadership,
   which is often positively related to personality traits such as
   boldness. Individuals consistently differ in how social they are (their
   sociability), so if other axes of personality variation, such as
   boldness, can be suppressed during social interactions, this suppression
   should be stronger in more sociable individuals. We measured boldness
   (latency to leave a refuge when alone) and sociability (time spent with
   a conspecific) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and
   tested the boldness-leadership association in pairs of these fish. Both
   boldness and sociability were repeatable, but were not correlated. When
   splitting the data between the 50\% most sociable and 50\% less sociable
   fish, boldness was more strongly associated with leadership in less
   rather than more sociable individuals. This is consistent with more
   sociable fish conforming to their partner's behaviour due to their
   greater social tendency. One axis of personality variation (sociability)
   can thus modulate the relationship between others (boldness and
   leadership), with potential implications for selection on personality
   variation in social animals.}},

Abstract = {{We tested if consistent individual differences (CIDs) in the behaviour
   of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) from the Laurentian Great Lakes
   could influence their vulnerability to trapping. The sea lamprey is
   invasive in the Upper Laurentian Great Lakes and the target of a
   binational control program. Trapping could be used for control if
   trapping efficiency is unbiased and effective. Our test involved
   comparing the behaviour of sea lamprey collected in the field from a
   trap (n = 42) at a barrier and electrofished (n = 9) downstream of the
   barrier. We quantified each individual's latency to exit an enclosure (a
   measure of exploration), proportion of time spent moving (a measure of
   general activity), and change in activity in response to a putative
   predator cue (a measure of boldness). CIDs were detected for each
   behaviour measured (intraclass correlations: 0.3-0.5). CIDs in behaviour
   also differed between trapped individuals and those collected downstream
   using electrofishing, irrespective of size, sex, and maturity status.
   Trapped individuals decreased their activity in response to a putative
   predator cue, while individuals collected using electrofishing increased
   their activity in response to the cue. Trapped individuals also tended
   to spend a greater proportion of time moving than individuals sampled
   downstream of the trap. However, the two samples of lamprey did not
   differ significantly in time taken to exit an enclosure. The behavioural
   differences between sea lamprey sampled from a trap and those sampled

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', the phenomenon of consistent individual
   differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely,
   yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence
   remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural
   variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on
   resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool
   prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk
   exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified
   open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual
   (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this
   species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent
   with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in
   size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high
   repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP
   (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations
   between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that
   individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not
   consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome'
   in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated
   with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some
   individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources,
   while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration
   (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource
   patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited
   resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality
   variation observed in wild populations. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Wild animals show consistent individual variation in behavior across
   time and/or contexts, now referred to as animal personality. While this
   variability may have important ecological and evolutionary implications,
   how and why variation in animal personality is maintained in a natural
   population remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of
   environmental and biological sources of variation on behavioral
   responses measured along the shy-bold continuum in a long-lived,
   iteroparous marine mammal, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). Between
   2008 and 2016, 469 females from the Sable Island, Nova Scotia breeding
   colony of gray seals were given a boldness score in response to a human
   approach, designed to stimulate maternal defense of offspring. Using
   generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework,
   we show that boldness is highly repeatable between and within years.
   There were age differences in boldness, with younger females being less
   bold than older, more experienced females providing some support for the
   life history trade-off hypothesis. We further used GLMMs to assess
   sources of variation on offspring weaning mass. We found that young
   females that were bolder produced heavier pups than shyer counterparts,
   and that pups produced by bolder females were on average 2 kg heavier
   than pups of shy females. These results provide further evidence that
   personality influences life history strategies, and illustrates the
   evolutionary potential of animal personality in response to selection.
   Consistent individual differences in behavior influence various aspects
   of ecology including species interactions, species distributions, and
   life history strategies. However, how and why this individual variation
   is maintained in a natural population remains uncertain. In this study,
   we assessed the influence of boldness, specifically maternal defense of
   offspring, on a component of reproductive success in a long-lived marine
   mammal. We showed highly repeatable behavioral differences, and found
   that boldness varied with age, with younger individuals being less bold
   than older individuals. Younger individuals that were bolder produced
   heavier offspring than shyer counterparts. Our study contributes to an
   under-represented group of animals, wild marine mammals, in the
   personality literature, and further prompts the investigation into the
   proximate and ultimate factors influencing personality in an
   ecologically important marine predator.}},

   Various characteristics associated with leadership have been documented
   across a range of social taxa, including hunger, motivation, dominance

   mechanisms that underlie leadership. Here, we tested whether the
   metabolic phenotype of individual fish (x-ray tetras, Pristella

   their tendency to act as leaders. In contrast to previous work, we found
   that individuals with low maximal metabolic rates and low aerobic scope
   tended to be more likely to be found at the front of shoals and were
   more likely to act as leaders. We suggest that leadership by
   low-performing individuals leads to greater group cohesion. However, in
   more challenging environmental contexts, such as flowing water, higher
   performing animals may be more likely to become leaders while
   low-performing individuals seek the more favourable hydrodynamic
   conditions at the rear of the group. Hence, the travelling speed of the

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity can occur in response to environmental fluctuation

   the effect of fire-altered landscapes on the locomotor performance of
   the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Lizard sprint
   performance was compared among three habitats with different fire
   histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more
   than 60years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in
   4years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6months prior to
   the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance
   among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic
   plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly
   higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control
   habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within
   individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of
   2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly
   repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain
   considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied
   to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
   observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of
   free-ranging S.undulatus. Lizards had similar body condition among
   habitats suggesting that nutritional status did not play a role in
   performance plasticity. Habitats differed both structurally and
   thermally, and less restrictive thermal regimes in recently burned
   habitats appear to be the underlying mechanism permitting increased
   lizard locomotor performance.}},

   interactions. We assessed IAc in 59 healthy participants (40 women,

   These results suggest that IAc measures are relatively consistent and

   shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming
   females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of
   preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may
   reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social
   dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for
   assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the
   existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals' choosiness across mate
   choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our
   present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of
   personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{A whole suite of parameters is likely to influence the behavior and
   performance of individuals as adults, including correlations between
   phenotypic traits or an individual's developmental context. Here, we ask
   the question whether behavior and physical performance traits are
   correlated and how early life parameters such as birth weight, litter
   size, and growth can influence these traits as measured during
   adulthood. We studied 486 captive gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus)
   and measured two behavioral traits and two performance traits
   potentially involved in two functions: exploration behavior with pull
   strength and agitation score with bite force. We checked for the
   existence of behavioral consistency in behaviors and explored
   correlations between behavior, performance, morphology. We analyzed the
   effect of birth weight, growth, and litter size, while controlling for
   age, sex, and body weight. Behavior and performance were not correlated
   with one another, but were both influenced by age. Growth rate had a
   positive effect on adult morphology, and birth weight significantly
   affected emergence latency and bite force. Grip strength was not
   directly affected by early life traits, but bite performance and
   exploration behavior were impacted by birth weight. This study shows how
   early life parameters impact personality and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is defined as consistency in individual differences in

   within behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Empirical data have revealed
   an ever-increasing number and diversity of taxa that display these

   behavioral traits are frequently linked to wild behavior, life history

   the presence of personality, with consistency in behavior across five
   metrics for the bold-shy axis, and eight sampling events measuring

Abstract = {{1. Many animal social structures are organized hierarchically, with some
   individuals monopolizing resources. Dominance hierarchies have received
   great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists.
   2. There are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social
   interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed
   dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for
   inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established
   tools for quantifying their uncertainty.
   3. We simulate interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying
   steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based
   on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the
   number of interactions recorded and the steepness of the hierarchy
   affect the performance of five methods for inferring hierarchies, (2)
   propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method,
   and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty and steepness
   in the inferred hierarchy.
   4. We find that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to
   infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the
   steepness of the hierarchy and the method used. We show that David's
   score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the best methods when
   hierarchies are not extremely steep, where the original Elo-rating, the
   I\&SI and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. In addition,
   we show that two simple methods can be used to estimate uncertainty at
   the individual and group level, and that the randomized Elo-rating
   repeatability provides researchers with a standardized measure valid for
   comparing the steepness of different hierarchies. We provide several
   worked examples to guide researchers interested in studying dominance
   hierarchies.
   5. Methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust. We
   recommend that a ratio of observed interactions to individuals of at
   least 10 (for steep hierarchies), and ideally 20 serves as a good
   benchmark. Our simple procedures for estimating uncertainty in the
   observed data will facilitate evaluating whether sufficient data have
   been collected, while plotting the shape of the hierarchy will provide
   new insights into the social structure of the study organism.}},

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids are highly conserved hormones that mediate a suite of
   responses to changing conditions in vertebrates. Recent work has focused
   on understanding how selection operates on glucocorticoid secretion in
   natural populations. Because heritability is rarely estimated and
   difficult to measure in the wild, many studies report within-individual
   repeatability as an estimate of stable between individual differences in
   glucocorticoid secretion. We conducted a systematic review and
   meta-analysis on estimates of within-individual glucocorticoid
   repeatability to elucidate general patterns of repeatability, and to
   test for relationships between covariates and estimates of
   repeatability. To this end, we collected 203 estimates of
   within-individual glucocorticoid repeatability drawn from 71 separate
   studies and 55 species. Overall, we found moderate levels of
   repeatability (0.29). We also found that repeatability varied by sample
   type. Long-term measures (e.g., fecal and feather samples) and acute
   stress-induced plasma glucocorticoids had higher repeatability
   (long-term: 0.44, stress-induced: 0.38), than baseline glucocorticoid
   levels (0.18). Repeatability also decreased with increasing time between
   repeated sampling events. Despite significant overall repeatability,
   there was substantial heterogeneity in estimates from different studies,
   suggesting that repeatability of glucocorticoid secretion varies
   substantially across systems and conditions. We discuss the implications
   of our results for understanding selection on glucocorticoid traits and
   suggest that continuing work should focus on evaluating the
   repeatability of within-individual glucocorticoid reaction norms. (C)

Abstract = {{The environment in which animals develop can have important consequences
   for their phenotype. In reptiles, incubation temperature is a critical
   aspect of the early developmental environment. Incubation temperature
   influences morphology, physiology, and behavior of non-avian reptiles,
   however, little is known about how incubation temperature influences
   offspring phenotype and behaviors important to avian survival. To
   investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors,
   we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated
   them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8,
   and 37.0 degrees C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on
   individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess
   activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a
   proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating
   levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to
   investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings
   incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors
   than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that
   younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings
   and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further,
   duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative
   of a proactive-reactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However,
   neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior.
   This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a
   critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may
   be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature
   as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits
   and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained
   within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis liberates
   glucocorticoids, which provides an acute indication of an individual's
   response to stressors. The heritability of the stress response in wild
   mammals, however, remains poorly documented. We quantified the cortisol
   stress response of female Richardson's ground squirrels (RGSs) to
   handling and physical restraint, testing for: (1) the effects of
   individual age, time of day, and sample latency; (2) repeatability
   within individuals; (3) narrow-sense heritability; and (4) differences
   among individuals owing to potential genetic and/or environmental
   effects. We detected a positive linear relationship between baseline
   plasma cortisol (BL-cortisol) concentration and stress-induced plasma
   cortisol (SI-cortisol) concentration that defined each individual's
   cortisol stress response. BL-cortisol, SI-cortisol, and stress response
   did not differ according to the time the sample was taken, or by subject
   age. Cortisol stress response was highly repeatable within individuals,
   had a mother-offspring heritability of h(2) = 0.40 +/- 0.24 (mean +/-
   SE), full-sibling heritability of H-FS(2) = 0.37 +/- 0.71, and
   half-sibling heritability of H-HS(2) = 0.75 +/- 1.41. Stress responses
   of sibling groups, immediate-family groups, and squirrels within a given
   area did not differ, whereas those of individuals from more distantly
   related matrilines did. Our results highlight the natural variability in
   HPA axis reactivity among individuals by quantifying both BL- and
   SI-cortisol levels, demonstrate partial heritability of the stress
   response that is not attributable to environmental variation, and
   suggest that at least part of an individual's stress response can be
   accounted for by differences in matrilineal history.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals actively defend their offspring using a range of behaviours
   from calling and mobbing in birds, to physical grappling in crustaceans,
   and the expression of these behaviours positively scale with offspring
   value. While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very
   little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of
   architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to
   offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent
   individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely
   unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We
   addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti,
   by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour
   and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative
   reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web
   structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of
   web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase.
   Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g.
   eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the
   variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of
   individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation
   drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits,
   suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in
   defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended
   phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in
   some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest
   that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some
   individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and
   vice versa. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation, which are mostly anthropogenically
   caused, can lead to decreasing population sizes for many species.
   Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression
   can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in
   inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on
   fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon
   cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural
   phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by
   inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression
   both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice
   during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is,
   activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent
   across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles
   differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were
   affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age.
   Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment
   than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in
   specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they
   reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits,
   the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected
   by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and
   thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased
   fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals
   might affect the further development and survival of populations and
   thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the
   ecosystem. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social
   environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of
   behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects
   that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male
   Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the
   effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual
   signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness,
   activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation.
   Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic
   sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and
   explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted
   in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of
   changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that
   mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The
   effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were
   far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social
   environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between
   behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the
   average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets
   were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets
   becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the
   nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations
   between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social

   used to test individual response to stress. In previous laboratory
   research, the HS test has revealed a continuous decrease from peak
   values immediately after catching, which was consistent in adults of
   precocial and altricial species. Because of opposite trends in nestlings
   versus adults in altricial birds, we ask what breath rate pattern
   appears in precocial chicks in natural conditions? Advanced development
   during their early ontogeny compared to altricials could lead to breath
   rates similar to adults, but the effect of age, (in)experience, as well
   as environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, may
   significantly shape breath rate patterns in chicks in different ways
   than in adults. In this study, we examined patterns in breath rate in
   response to HS in chicks of different age in a precocial wader, the
   Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) in the wild. Factors responsible
   for variation were simultaneously identified. We show that breath rate
   significantly dropped after visual isolation in a textile bag, a pattern
   similar to that in adult birds, and increased with the age of chicks as
   well as with higher ambient temperature. Breath rate was individually
   repeatable, but did not reflect individual behaviour observed before
   capture. Our results suggest that, when controlled for ambient
   temperature and time before catching, the breath rate pattern has the
   potential to be used as a useful HS test for neonatal Northern Lapwing

Abstract = {{The hippocampal formation is a complex brain structure that is important
   in cognitive processes such as memory, mood, reward processing and other
   executive functions. Histological and neuroimaging studies have
   implicated the hippocampal region in neuropsychiatric disorders as well
   as in neurodegenerative diseases. This highly plastic limbic region is
   made up of several subregions that are believed to have different
   functional roles. Therefore, there is a growing interest in imaging the
   subregions of the hippocampal formation rather than modelling the
   hippocampus as a homogenous structure, driving the development of new
   automated analysis tools. Consequently, there is a pressing need to
   understand the stability of the measures derived from these new
   techniques. In this study, an automated hippocampal subregion
   segmentation pipeline, released as a developmental version of Freesurfer
   (v6.0), was applied to T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   scans of 22 healthy older participants, scanned on 3 separate occasions
   and a separate longitudinal dataset of 40 Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   patients. Test-retest reliability of hippocampal subregion volumes was
   assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), percentage
   volume difference and percentage volume overlap (Dice). Sensitivity of
   the regional estimates to longitudinal change was estimated using linear
   mixed effects (LME) modelling. The results show that out of the 24
   hippocampal subregions, 20 had ICC scores of 0.9 or higher in both
   samples; these regions include the molecular layer, granule cell layer
   of the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3 and the subiculum (ICC>0.9), whilst the
   hippocampal fissure and fimbria had lower ICC scores (0.73-0.88).
   Furthermore, LME analysis of the independent AD dataset demonstrated
   sensitivity to group and individual differences in the rate of volume
   change over time in several hippocampal subregions (CA1, molecular
   layer, CA3, hippocampal tail, fissure and presubiculum). These results
   indicate that this automated segmentation method provides a robust
   method with which to measure hippocampal subregions, and may be useful
   in tracking disease progression and measuring the effects of
   pharmacological intervention.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Animals in urban habitats face many novel selection pressures such as
   increased human population densities and human disturbance. This is
   predicted to favour bolder and more aggressive individuals together with
   greater flexibility in behaviour. Previous work has focussed primarily
   on studying these traits in captive birds and has shown increased
   aggression and reduced consistency between traits (behavioural
   syndromes) in birds from urban populations. However, personality
   (consistency within a behavioural trait) has not been well studied in
   the wild. Here we tested whether urban free-living male great tits show
   greater territorial aggression than rural counterparts. We also tested
   predictions that both behavioural syndromes and personality would show
   lower consistency in urban populations. We found that urban populations
   were more aggressive than rural populations and urban birds appeared to
   show lower levels of individual behavioural repeatability (personality)
   as predicted. However, we found no effect of urbanisation on behavioural
   syndromes (correlations between multiple behavioural traits). Our
   results indicate that urban environments may favour individuals which
   exhibit increased territorial aggression and greater within-trait
   flexibility which may be essential to success in holding urban
   territories. Determining how urban environments impact key fitness
   traits will be important in predicting how animals cope with ongoing
   urbanisation.}},

Volume = {{373}},

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to develop and validate a measure of maximal
   telomerase activity capacity (mTAC) for use in human studies of telomere
   biology, and to determine its association with measures of stress and
   stress responsivity. The study was conducted in a population of 28
   healthy young women and men who were assessed serially across two
   separate days, at multiple time points, and in response to a
   standardized laboratory stressor. Venous blood was collected at each of
   these multiple assessments, and an in vitro mitogen challenge
   (phytohaemagglutinin supplemented with interleukin-2) was used to
   stimulate telomerase activity in leucocytes. After first establishing
   the optimal post-stimulation time course to characterize mTAC, we
   determined the within-subject stability and the between-subject
   variability of mTAC. The major findings of our study are as follows: (i)
   the optimal time point to quantify human leucocyte mTAC appears to be at
   72 h after mitogen stimulation; (ii) mTAC exhibits substantial
   within-subject stability (correlations were in the range of r 0.68-0.82)
   and between-subject variability, with a high intraclass coefficient
   (0.70), indicating greater between-subject relative to within-subject
   variability; (iii) mTAC is not influenced by situational factors
   including time of day, cortisol, acute stress exposure and immune cell
   distribution in the pre-stimulation blood sample; and (iv) a significant
   proportion of the between-subject variability in mTAC is associated with
   measures of stress and stress responsivity (mTAC is lower in subjects
   reporting higher levels of perceived (chronic) stress and exhibiting
   higher psychophysiological stress reactivity). Based collectively on
   these findings, it appears that mTAC, as proposed and operationalized,
   empirically meets the key criteria to represent a potentially useful
   individual difference measure of telomerase activity capacity of human
   leucocytes.

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{During the last few years, research interest on interindividual
   differences in acute affective reactions on sport activities has
   increased. Moreover, current studies show that besides interindividual
   differences, substantial intraindividual variations exist. Therefore, we
   assume that the potential of regulating affective well-being through
   sport activities varies situationally. This ambulatory assessment study
   analyzes affective reactions on sport activities in daily routine to
   identify possible factors for situational variability of changes in
   affective well-being. First, situational differences in affective
   well-being (valence, calmness, energetic arousal), goals for sport
   activities (e.g., regulation of body weight, activation), and activity
   characteristics (e.g., activity dose, perceived exertion) were analyzed.
   Second, associations between these parameters and activity
   characteristics were dissected. Third, associations with affective
   well-being after sport activities are identified. For 7 days, 25 women
   and 21 men (M-age = 32 years) participated. Activity characteristics
   were captured objectively (accelerometer, electrocardiogramm). Affective
   well-being, situational goals, and perceived exertion were gathered via
   smartphone. Multilevel analyses confirmed situational heterogeneity of
   affective well-being (e.g., intraclass-coefficient ICCvalence = 0.48),
   situational goals (e.g., ICCactivation = 0.59), and activity
   characteristics (e.g., ICCactivity (dose) = 0.21). Furthermore, we
   observed that higher feelings of calmness and stronger situational goals
   for body weight and activation are followed by a higher activity dose.
   This higher activity dose comes along with higher energetic arousal
   after sport activities, whereas higher perceived exertion is followed by
   lower feelings of calmness. Study results confirm intraindividual
   variation of affective well-being, specific goals, and activity
   characteristics. They emphasize the relevance of situational
   characteristics for the regulation of affective well-being through sport
   activities.}},

Journal = {{DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Valid length measurements of the different segments of the
   Achilles tendon are needed in order to investigate if differential
   elongation of the Achilles tendon takes place after rupture. The purpose
   of this paper was to present data concerning the accuracy and
   reliability of an ultrasound measurement of the free part of the
   Achilles tendon.
   METHODS: Both legs of 19 non-injured subjects were examined by magnetic
   resonance imagining (MRI) and ultrasound. The length from the distal tip
   of the soleus muscle to the tendon insertion on the calcaneus was
   measured by three independent ultrasound examiners. Repeated ultrasound
   measurements were performed and compared with MRI measurements.
   Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and the agreement between MRI
   and ultrasound were determined. Data were evaluated using the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of the measurement
   (SEM) and the minimal detectable change (MDC).
   RESULTS: The measurement showed excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC =
   0.94 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-0.96), SEM = 5 mm and MDC = 13
   mm) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.93-0.97), SEM =
   4 mm and MDC = 11 mm). On average, ultrasound measurements exceeded the
   MRI measurements by 2 mm (non-significant); resulting in a measurement
   error of 5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasound measurement of the free part of the Achilles
   tendon showed good reliability and accuracy. For comparison between
   groups of non-injured subjects, differences of > 5 mm can be detected.
   For repeated assessment of individual subject differences >= 13 mm can
   be detected.}},

Abstract = {{We compared different methodological approaches in research on the

   people's personality traits as criteria for stereotype accuracy. Our
   sample comprised 16,713 participants from the Central Europe and 1,090
   participants from the Baltic Sea region. Participants rated national
   stereotypes of their own country using the National Character Survey
   (NCS) and their personality traits using either the Revised NEO
   Personality Inventory or the NCS. We examined the effects of different
   (i) methods for rating of real people (Revised NEO Personality Inventory
   vs. NCS) and national stereotypes (NCS); (ii) norms for converting raw
   scores into T-scores (Russian vs. international norms); and (iii)
   correlation techniques (intraclass correlations vs. Pearson correlations
   vs. rank-order correlations) on the resulting agreement between the
   ratings of national stereotypes and real people. We showed that the
   accuracy of national stereotypes depended on the employed methodology.
   The accuracy was the highest when ratings of real people and national
   stereotypes were made using the same method and when rank order
   correlations were used to estimate the agreement between national
   stereotypes and personality profiles of real people. We propose a new
   statistical procedure for determining national stereotype accuracy that

   recognition acuity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When measuring recognition acuity in a research setting, the most widely
   used symbols are the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study
   (ETDRS) set of 10 Sloan letters. However, the symbols are not
   appropriate for patients unfamiliar with letters, and acuity for
   individual letters is variable. Alternative pictogram sets are
   available, but are generally comprised of fewer items. We set out to
   develop an open-access set of 10 pictograms that would elicit more
   consistent estimates of acuity across items than the ETDRS letters from
   visually normal adults. We measured monocular acuity for individual
   uncrowded optotypes within a newly designed set (The Auckland Optotype
   {[}TAO]), the ETDRS set, and Landolt Cs. Eleven visually normal adults
   were assessed on regular and vanishing formats of each set.
   Inter-optotype reliability and ability to detect subtle differences
   between participants were assessed using intraclass correlations (ICC)
   and fractional rank precision (FRP). The TAO vanishing set showed the
   strongest performance (ICC = 0.97, FRP = 0.90), followed by the other
   vanishing sets (Sloan ICC = 0.88, FRP = 0.74; Landolt ICC = 0.86, FRP =
   0.80). Within the regular format, TAO again outperformed the existing
   sets (TAO ICC = 0.77, FRP = 0.75; Sloan ICC = 0.65, FRP = 0.64; Landolt
   ICC = 0.48, FRP = 0.63). For adults with normal visual acuity, the new
   optotypes (in both regular and vanishing formats) are more equally
   legible and sensitive to subtle individual differences than their Sloan
   counterparts. As this set does not require observers to be able to name
   Roman letters, and is freely available to use and modify, it may have
   wide application for measurement of acuity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) is
   considered the gold standard assessment for accurate, reliable
   psychiatric diagnoses; however, because of its length, complexity, and
   training required, the SCID is rarely used outside of research.
   Objective: This paper aims to describe the development and initial
   validation of a Web-based, self-report screening instrument (the
   Screening Assessment for Guiding Evaluation-Self-Report, SAGE-SR) based
   on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
   Edition (DSM-5) and the SCID-5-Clinician Version (CV) intended to make
   accurate, broad-based behavioral health diagnostic screening more
   accessible within clinical care.
   Methods: First, study staff drafted approximately 1200 self-report items
   representing individual granular symptoms in the diagnostic criteria for
   the 8 primary SCID-CV modules. An expert panel iteratively reviewed,
   critiqued, and revised items. The resulting items were iteratively
   administered and revised through 3 rounds of cognitive interviewing with
   community mental health center participants. In the first 2 rounds, the
   SCID was also administered to participants to directly compare their
   Likert self-report and SCID responses. A second expert panel evaluated
   the final pool of items from cognitive interviewing and criteria in the
   DSM-5 to construct the SAGE-SR, a computerized adaptive instrument that
   uses branching logic from a screener section to administer appropriate
   follow-up questions to refine the differential diagnoses. The SAGE-SR
   was administered to healthy controls and outpatient mental health clinic
   clients to assess test duration and test-retest reliability. Cutoff
   scores for screening into follow-up diagnostic sections and criteria for
   inclusion of diagnoses in the differential diagnosis were evaluated.
   Results: The expert panel reduced the initial 1200 test items to 664
   items that panel members agreed collectively represented the SCID items
   from the 8 targeted modules and DSM criteria for the covered diagnoses.
   These 664 items were iteratively submitted to 3 rounds of cognitive
   interviewing with 50 community mental health center participants; the
   expert panel reviewed session summaries and agreed on a final set of 661
   clear and concise self-report items representing the desired criteria in
   the DSM-5. The SAGE-SR constructed from this item pool took an average
   of 14 min to complete in a nonclinical sample versus 24 min in a
   clinical sample. Responses to individual items can be combined to
   generate DSM criteria endorsements and differential diagnoses, as well
   as provide indices of individual symptom severity. Preliminary measures
   of test-retest reliability in a small, nonclinical sample were
   promising, with good to excellent reliability for screener items in 11
   of 13 diagnostic screening modules intraclass correlation coefficient
   {[}ICC] or kappa coefficients ranging from .60 to .90), with mania
   achieving fair test-retest reliability (ICC=.50) and other substance use
   endorsed too infrequently for analysis.
   Conclusions: The SAGE-SR is a computerized adaptive self-report
   instrument designed to provide rigorous differential diagnostic
   information to clinicians.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In many animal populations, individuals exhibit repeatable behavioral
   traits across a range of contexts, and similarly, individuals differ in
   ecological traits such as habitat use, home range sizes, growth rates,
   and mating success. However, links between an individual's positions on
   behavioral vs. ecological axes of variation remain relatively unstudied
   in the wild. In the course of fieldwork on a remote floodplain in
   tropical Australia, we quantified boldness and ecological traits in 86
   free-ranging (radio-tracked) monitor lizards (Varanus panoptes). These
   large (up to 7 kg) lizards exhibited a spectrum of boldness, as
   reflected in correlated scores of responses to approach, handling, and
   novel prey. Bolder lizards had larger core home ranges and higher mating
   success and spent more time in areas of high predator abundance, and
   their seasonal regimes of predation-induced mortality differed from
   those of shyer lizards. Thus, behavioral differences among lizards
   underpin much of the variation in ecological traits and individual
   fitness within this population. Analyses of ecology and microevolution
   in natural populations cannot afford to ignore the complex covariation
   between behavior, ecology, and evolution in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Yin-Yang is a pivotal concept of traditional East-Asian
   medicine, however the stability of Yin-Yang temperament in Sasang
   Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) over time has not been extensively
   studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest
   validity of SPQ with a large number of participants.
   Methods: SPQ test was conducted two times with three months interval in
   247 Korean university students. The structural validity of first SPQ
   data was examined with Factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha, and the
   correlation between first and second measure of SPQ was attested with
   Pearson's correlation. Yang, Uncertain and Yin temperament groups were
   determined with SPQ total scores, and agreement of temperament group
   clustering between first and second measures were analyzed with Cohen's
   Kappa.
   Results: Three subscales of SPQ explained 55.25\% of total variances,
   and internal consistency of SPQ total score was 0.772. The correlation
   coefficient between first and second measures of SPQ were 0.851 and
   0.888 in male and female, respectively, and the agreement of first and
   second Yin-Yang temperament group clustering as Cohen's Kappa was 0.536
   for male and 0.637 for female.
   Conclusion: The repeatability of SPQ measuring Yin-Yang temperament at
   three months of interval was found to be satisfactory. The SPQ would be
   a reliable clinical measure for the biopsychological studies of
   traditional East-Asian medicine. (C) 2018 Korea Institute of Oriental

   whole-lake scale while simultaneously tracking boats of small groups of
   experimental anglers (n = 104) who varied by self-reported skill. We
   report two key findings. First, perch vulnerability was strongly related
   to a repeatable habitat choice behaviour, but unrelated to swimming
   activity as a personality trait; importantly, highly vulnerable perch
   were captured throughout the lake and not only in their preferred
   habitat, suggesting covariance between spatial habitat choice and a
   behavioural determinant of vulnerability. Second, catch per unit effort
   of large perch increased with self-reported angling skill, an effect
   unrelated to skill-dependent lure use or an angler's ability to
   encounter perch. Importantly, high-skill anglers captured more fish but
   not different spatial behavioural phenotypes. Our study has implications
   for designing protected areas by showcasing that angling could
   systematically alter the habitat use of exploited populations at
   whole-ecosystem scales, without necessarily changing average swimming
   activity and home range extension.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a dual-mode actuation and sensing scheme for
   differential operation and self-calibration of axisymmetric Coriolis
   resonant gyroscopes. The proposed scheme actuates both modes of an
   axisymmetric gyroscope with two identical in-phase excitation signals,
   and senses both modes concurrently. This dual-mode actuation
   architecture utilizes the difference of the individual mode outputs to
   cancel out the common-mode bias terms, and provide rate-independent
   frequency split monitoring. The symmetry of the dual-mode architecture
   can be utilized to provide in-run scale factor calibration capability by
   mimicking the mechanical Coriolis force in the electrical domain,
   thereby providing a virtual electrical rotation to the gyroscope, to
   estimate the drift of the physical scale factor over time and
   temperature. The dual-mode architecture is demonstrated on a 2.625-MHz
   substrate-decoupled bulk acoustic wave gyroscope. The inherent bias
   cancellation provides sub10 degrees/hr bias instability, with 1.4x
   improvement of angle random walk, as compared with the conventional
   single-mode actuation scheme. Benefiting from the in-run mode-matching
   capability, the dual-mode actuation scheme exhibits 45x reduction of
   bias drift over a temperature range of {[}10-80] degrees C. In-run scale
   factor calibration achieves 150x reduction of scale factor turn-on
   repeatability error down to 62 ppm, and over 100x reduction of the
   temperature drift of scale factor over {[} 10-50]degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{1. Risk assessments of alien species are usually conducted at species
   level, assuming that all individuals of a given species pose similar
   risks. However, this may not be the case if there is substantial
   within-species variation that could influence invasion success.
   2. We used a seed addition experiment, comprising 25 taxonomically
   stratified varieties of three Brassica species introduced to roadside
   habitats in Canterbury, New Zealand, to quantify variation in
   performance among species, subspecies and varieties. We aimed to assess
   if species was the most appropriate taxonomic level at which to evaluate
   invasion risk.
   3. Differences among varieties within species explained approximately 30
   times more of the variation in performance (number of
   individuals/quadrat) than differences among species. Some of the
   variation among varieties was attributable to differences in seed
   viability.
   4. Nevertheless, differences among taxonomic groups explained only 7\%
   of the total variation in performance; 28\% was attributable to
   differences among plots, reflecting broad-scale environmental variation,
   while 65\% was attributable to differences among quadrats nested within
   plots, highlighting the importance of fine-scale variation in the
   availability of suitable microsites.
   5. Policy Implications. Our seed addition experiment quantified
   variation in performance of 25 taxonomically stratified Brassica taxa
   introduced to roadside habitats. Varieties (nested within species)
   differed in performance far more than did species. This suggests risk
   assessments carried out at species level may overlook important
   subspecific variation in invasion risk. This is particularly true for
   conventionally bred and genetically modified species, which may contain
   taxa posing risks different to that at which the species is assessed.
   Consideration should be given to subjecting unassessed subspecies and
   varieties of plants to risk assessments similar to those applied to
   species.}},

   dynamics and how they will respond to selection. Previous studies
   demonstrate that metabolic rates are repeatable under constant
   conditions but potentially less so in more variable environments. We
   measured the standard (= minimum) metabolic rate, maximum metabolic
   rate, and aerobic scope (= interval between standard and maximum rates)
   in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) after 5 weeks acclimation to each
   of three consecutive test temperatures (10, 13, and then 16 degrees C)
   that simulated the warming conditions experienced throughout their first
   summer of growth. We found that metabolic rates are repeatable over a
   period of months under changing thermal conditions: individual trout
   exhibited consistent differences in all three metabolic traits across

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals
   alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in

   as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically

   estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour
   attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that
   only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level

   and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone
   levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of
   among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was
   nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive
   explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual
   variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear,
   additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii)
   explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv)

Title = {{Repeatability of glucocorticoid hormones in vertebrates: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{We often expect that investigations of the patterns, causes, and
   consequences of among-individual variation in a trait of interest will
   reveal how selective pressures or ecological conditions influence that
   trait. However, many endocrine traits, such as concentrations of
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, exhibit adaptive plasticity and,
   therefore, do not necessarily respond to these pressures as predicted by
   among-individual phenotypic correlations. To improve our interpretations
   of among-individual variation in GC concentrations, we need more
   information about the repeatability of these traits within individuals.
   Many studies have already estimated the repeatability of baseline,
   stress-induced, and integrated GC measures, which provides an
   opportunity to use meta-analytic techniques to investigate (1) whether
   GC titers are generally repeatable across taxa, and (2) which biological
   or methodological factors may impact these estimates. From an intensive
   search of the literature, we collected 91 GC repeatability estimates
   from 47 studies. Overall, we found evidence that GC levels are
   repeatable, with mean repeatability estimates across studies ranging
   from 0.230 for baseline levels to 0.386 for stress-induced levels. We
   also noted several factors that predicted the magnitude of these
   estimates, including taxon, sampling season, and lab technique.
   Amphibians had significantly higher repeatability in baseline and
   stress-induced GCs than birds, mammals, reptiles, or bony fish. The
   repeatability of stress-induced GCs was higher when measured within,
   rather than across, life history stages. Finally, estimates of
   repeatability in stress-induced and integrated GC measures tended to be
   lower when GC concentrations were quantified using commercial kit assays
   rather than in-house assays. The extent to which among-individual
   variation in GCs may explain variation in organismal performance or
   fitness (and thereby inform our understanding of the ecological and
   evolutionary processes driving that variation) depends on whether
   measures of GC titers accurately reflect how individuals differ overall.
   Our findings suggest that while GC titers can reflect some degree of
   consistent differences among individuals, they frequently may not. We
   discuss how our findings contribute to interpretations of variation in
   GCs, and suggest routes for the design and analysis of future research.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing how collective behaviour emerges is central to our
   understanding of animal societies. Previous research has highlighted how
   universal interaction rules shape collective behaviour, and that
   individual differences can drive group functioning. Groups themselves
   may also differ considerably in their collective behaviour, but little
   is known about the consistency of such group variation, especially
   across different ecological contexts that may alter individuals'
   behavioural responses. Here, we test if randomly composed groups of
   sticklebacks differ consistently from one another in both their
   structure and movement dynamics across an open environment, an
   environment with food, and an environment with food and shelter. Based
   on high-resolution tracking data of the free-swimming shoals, we found
   large context-associated changes in the average behaviour of the groups.
   But despite these changes and limited social familiarity among group
   members, substantial and predictable behavioural differences between the
   groups persisted both within and across the different contexts
   (group-level repeatability): some groups moved consistently faster, more
   cohesively, showed stronger alignment and/or clearer leadership than
   other groups. These results suggest that among-group heterogeneity could

   summary statistic in evolutionarily motivated studies of morphology,

   statistical methods to estimate R are well known and widely available,
   there is a growing tendency for researchers to interpret R in ways that

   dataset and a statistic to be interpreted agnostically with respect to
   mechanism. Others wish to isolate the contributions of `intrinsic'
   and/or `permanent' individual differences, and draw a distinction
   between true (intrinsic) and pseudo-repeatability arising from
   uncontrolled extrinsic effects. This latter view proposes a narrower,
   more mechanistic interpretation, than the traditional concept of
   repeatability, but perhaps one that allows stronger evolutionary
   inference as a consequence (provided analytical pitfalls are

Abstract = {{Background: Auditory-evoked potentials have proven useful in the
   objective evaluation of sound encoding at different stages of the
   auditory pathway (brainstem and cortex). Yet, their utility for use in
   clinical assessment and empirical research relies critically on the
   precision and test-retest repeatability of the measure.
   Purpose: To determine how subcortical/cortical classes of auditory
   neural responses directly compare in terms of their internal consistency
   and test-retest reliability within and between listeners.
   Research Design: A descriptive cohort study describing the dispersion of
   electrophysiological measures.
   Study Sample: Eight young, normal-hearing female listeners.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Werecorded auditory brainstem responses
   (ABRs), brainstem frequency following responses (FFRs), and cortical
   (P1-N1-P2) auditory-evoked potentials elicited by speech sounds in the
   same set of listeners. We reassessed responses within each of four
   different test sessions over a period of 1 mo, allowing us to detect
   possible changes in latency/amplitude characteristics with finer detail
   than in previous studies.
   Results: Our findings show that brainstem and cortical amplitude/latency
   measures are remarkably stable; with the exception of slight
   prolongation of the P1 wave, we found no significant variation in any
   response measure. Intraclass correlation analysis revealed that the
   speech-evoked FFR amplitude and latency measures achieved superior
   repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.85) among the more
   widely used obligatory brainstem (ABR) and cortical (P1-N1-P2)
   auditory-evoked potentials. Contrasting these intersubject effects,
   intrasubject variability (i.e., within-subject coefficient of variation)
   revealed that while latencies were more stable than amplitudes,
   brainstem and cortical responses did not differ in their variability at
   the single subject level.
   Conclusions: We conclude that (1) the variability of auditory neural
   responses increases with ascending level along the auditory neuroaxis
   (cortex. brainstem) between subjects but remains highly stable within
   subjects and (2) speech-FFRs might provide a more stable measure of
   auditory function than other conventional responses (e.g., click-ABR),
   given their lower inter-and intrasubject variability.}},

   novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during

   although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate.
   Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number

   explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest
   before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Ambulatory tracking of sleep and sleep pathology is
   rapidly increasing with the introduction of wearable devices. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate a wearable device which used
   novel computational analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG), collected
   over multiple nights, as a method to track the dynamics of sleep quality
   in health and disease.
   Methods: This study used the ECG as a primary signal, a wearable device,
   the M1, and an analysis of cardiopulmonary coupling to estimate sleep
   quality. The M1 measures trunk movements, the ECG, body position, and
   snoring vibrations. Data from three groups of patients were analyzed:
   healthy participants and people with sleep apnea and insomnia, obtained
   from multiple nights of recording. Analysis focused on summary measures
   and night-to-night variability, specifically the intraclass coefficient.
   Results: Data were collected from 10 healthy participants, 18 people
   with positive pressure-treated sleep apnea, and 20 people with insomnia,
   128, 65, and 121 nights, respectively. In any participant, all nights
   were consecutive. High-frequency coupling (HFC), the signal biomarker of
   stable breathing and stable sleep, showed high intraclass coefficients
   (ICCs) in healthy participants and people with sleep apnea (0.83, 0.89),
   but only 0.66 in people with insomnia. The only statistically
   significant difference between weekday and weekend in healthy subjects
   was HFC duration: 242.8 +/- 53.8 vs. 275.8 +/- 57.1 minutes (89 vs. 39
   total nights), F-(1,F-126) = 9.86, p=.002.
   Conclusions: The M1 and similar wearable devices provide new

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing individual variation in parental care is critical to
   understanding how selection shapes and maintains patterns of care, yet
   little is known about how individual parents vary in their responses to
   the environment. Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes
   change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework
   for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a
   reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which
   describes variation within an individual through time, and personality,
   which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain
   individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish
   Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability
   influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss
   the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in
   parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a
   low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored.
   Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two
   resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their
   behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual
   variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual
   reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at
   the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms
   generating individual variation. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Consistent differences in behavior between individuals, otherwise known
   as animal personalities, have become a staple in behavioral ecology due
   to their ability to explain a wide range of phenomena. Social organisms
   are especially serviceable to animal personality techniques because they
   can be used to explore behavioral variation at both the individual and
   group level. Despite the success of personality research in social
   organisms generally, and social Hymenoptera in particular, social wasps
   (Vespidae) have received little to no attention in the personality
   literature. In the present study, we test Polistes metricus (Vespidae;
   Polistinae) paper wasp queens for the presence of repeatable variation
   in, and correlations ({''}behavioral syndromes{''}) between, several
   commonly used personality metrics: boldness, aggressiveness,
   exploration, and activity. Our results indicate that P. metricus queens
   exhibit personalities for all measured traits and correlations between
   different behavioral measures. Given that paper wasps have served as a
   model organism for a wide range of phenomena such as kin selection,
   dominance hierarchies, mate choice, facial recognition, social
   parasitism, and chemical recognition, we hope that our results will
   motivate researchers to explore whether, or to what degree, queen

   behaviour in eastern chipmunks}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although locomotor performance and behaviour are closely linked to
   survival in many wild animals, our understanding of the potentially
   important co-adaptations between locomotor performance and behaviour is
   still limited. Our objective was to quantify the among-individual
   correlation (rind) and within-individual correlation (re) between
   locomotor performance and personality traits in wild eastern chipmunks
   (Tamias striatus). We repeatedly measured sprint speed, docility, and
   exploration behaviour and found that all traits were significantly
   repeatable. Sprint speed was not correlated with docility and time spent
   in the centre of the open field. However, sprint speed was significantly
   and negatively correlated with distance moved in the open field at both
   the among-individual (rind = -0.59) and the within-individual (re =
   -0.54) levels. Thus, individuals with high locomotor performance are
   less explorative in a novel environment, which is somewhat
   counter-intuitive and opposite to the predictions generated by the
   pace-of-life syndrome and the ``phenotypic compensation{''} hypotheses.
   Our results suggest that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are
   co-specialised traits as they can reinforce each other's effects in
   reducing predation risk. In refuging species such as chipmunks (i.e.
   individuals have to leave a refuge to forage), low exploration levels
   may reduce exposure to predators and high sprint speed may further
   reduce the probability of capture given an encounter with a predator.
   Thus, looking at how locomotor performance and behaviour interact and
   contribute to fitness is key to understanding the multivariate
   architecture of-and co-adaptations among-ecologically relevant complex
   phenotypes.
   Significance statement
   A large number of studies have looked at the relationships between
   locomotor performance and behaviour at the inter-specific,
   among-individual, and within-individual levels, with mixed results. We
   found a significant and negative relationship between sprint speed and
   distance moved during an open-field test, which goes against the
   prediction of the pace-of-life syndrome and the ``phenotypic
   compensation{''} hypotheses. Instead, these results support the Btrait
   co-specialisation{''} hypothesis. In refuging animals such as chipmunks,
   reactive behaviours (being shy and less exploratory) may reduce exposure
   to predators and high sprint speed may further the probability of
   escaping given an encounter with a predator. Taken all together, the
   negative among- and within-individual correlations and sensitivity to
   the same covariates (parasites, and to a less extent body mass) suggest
   that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are co-adapted in eastern
   chipmunks.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral plasticity induced by maternal effects is crucial in
   adjusting offspring phenotype to match the environment. In particular,
   changes in water availability during development may initiate a range of
   behavioral responses, such as natal dispersal, but the contribution of
   maternal effects from water stress in explaining behavioral variation
   has been overlooked so far. In this study, we examined behavioral
   plasticity of juvenile common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) in response to
   changes in pre-natal and post-natal hydric conditions. We exposed
   pregnant mothers either to a moderate water restriction or to ad libitum
   access to water. We used neutral arena tests to measure repeatedly
   activity and space use behaviors of their offspring, either in dry or
   wet soil conditions, at two distinct life stages (juveniles and
   yearlings) in order to quantify behavioral flexibility, age differences,
   and personalities (consistent inter-individual differences). Juveniles
   and yearlings had greater exploration scores in dry than wet conditions
   regardless of the pre-natal conditions. Pre-natal water restriction and
   dry post-natal conditions enhanced thigmotaxis (i.e., a behavior related
   to anxiety) in juveniles. Maternal environment did not influence
   behavioral flexibility nor the behavior of yearlings. Behaviors were
   barely repeatable in juveniles and inconsistent through early life.
   Assuming that dry conditions may initiate flight responses, these
   results suggest complex relationships between the developmental timing
   of water stress, exploration and anxiety behaviors, and dispersal
   syndromes.
   Significance statement
   Water restriction should initiate a range of behaviors related to a
   flight response. However, there is little evidence that changes in water
   availability across development influence offspring behavior in wild
   animals. Experiments with lizards demonstrate that maternal water
   restriction increased the anxiety of their juveniles, whereas their
   exploration was higher in dry environments. Thus, water availability may
   be a critical determinant of space use behavior and dispersal syndromes.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{In biparental systems, sexual conflict over parental investment predicts
   that the parent providing care experiences greater reproductive costs.
   This inequality in parental contribution is reduced when offspring
   survival is dependent on biparental care. However, this idea has
   received little empirical attention. Here, we determined whether mothers
   and fathers differed in their contribution to care in a captive
   population of coyotes (Canis latrans). We performed parental care assays
   on 8 (n = 8 males, 8 females) mated pairs repeatedly over a 10-week
   period (i.e., 5-15 weeks of litter age) when pairs were first-time
   breeders (2011), and again as experienced breeders (2013). We quantified
   consistent individual variation (i.e., repeatability) in 8 care
   behaviors and examined within-and among-individual correlations to
   determine if behavioral plasticity within or parental personality across
   seasons varied by sex. Finally, we extracted hormone metabolites (i.e.,
   cortisol and testosterone) from fecal samples collected during gestation
   to describe potential links between hormonal mechanisms and individual
   consistency in parental behaviors. Parents differed in which behaviors
   were repeatable: mothers demonstrated consistency in provisioning and
   pup-directed aggression, whereas fathers were consistent in pup checks.
   However, positive within-individual correlations for identical behaviors
   (e.g., maternal versus paternal play) suggested that the rate of change
   in all behaviors except provisioning was highly correlated between the
   sexes. Moreover, positive among-individual correlations among 50\% of
   identical behaviors suggested that personality differences across
   parents were highly correlated. Lastly, negative among-individual
   correlations among pup-directed aggression, provisioning, and
   gestational testosterone in both sexes demonstrated potential links
   between preparental hormones and labile parental traits. We provide
   novel evidence that paternal contribution in a biparental species
   reaches near equivalent rates of their partners.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Within populations, individuals can vary in stress response, a
   multivariate phenomenon comprising neuroendocrine, physiological and
   behavioural traits. Verbal models of individual stress coping style have
   proposed that the behavioural component of this variation can be
   described as a single axis, with each individual's coping style being
   consistent across time and stress contexts. Focusing on this behavioural
   component of stress response and combining repeated measures of multiple
   traits with a novel multivariate modelling framework, we test for the
   existence of coping style variation and assess its stability across
   contexts in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically,
   we test the following hypotheses: (1) there exists repeatable
   among-individual behavioural (co)variation (personality) within a mild
   stress context consistent with a risk-averse-risk-prone continuum of
   behavioural coping style, (2) there is population-level plasticity in
   behaviour as a function of stressor severity, (3) there is
   among-individual variation in plasticity (i.e. IxE), and (4) the
   presence of IxE reduces cross-context stability of behavioural coping
   style. We found significant repeatable among-individual behavioural
   (co)variation in the mild stress context (open field trial), represented
   as an I matrix. However, I was not readily described by a simple
   risk-averse-risk-prone continuum as posited by the original coping style
   model. We also found strong evidence for population-level changes in
   mean behaviour with increasing stressor severity (simulated avian and
   piscine predation risks). Single-trait analyses did show the presence of
   individual-by-environment interactions (IxE), as among-individual
   cross-context correlations were significantly less than +1. However,
   multitrait analysis revealed the consequences of this plasticity
   variation were minimal. Specifically, we found little evidence for
   changes in the structure of I between mild and moderate stress contexts
   overall, and only minor changes between the two moderate contexts (avian
   vs. piscine predator). We show that a multivariate approach to assessing
   changes in among-individual (co)variance across contexts can prevent the
   over-interpretation of statistically significant, but small,
   individual-by-environment effects. While behavioural flexibility enables
   populations (and individuals) to respond rapidly to changes in the
   environment, multivariate personality structure can be conserved
   strongly across such contexts.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background Schizotypal traits are considered a phenotypic-indicator of
   schizotypy, a latent personality organization reflecting a putative
   liability for psychosis. To date, no previous study has examined the
   comparability of factorial structures across samples originating from
   different countries and cultures. The main goal was to evaluate the
   factorial structure and reliability of the Schizotypal Personality
   Questionnaire (SPQ) scores by amalgamating data from studies conducted
   in 12 countries and across 21 sites.
   Method The overall sample consisted of 27 001 participants (37.5\%
   males, n = 4251 drawn from the general population). The mean age was
   22.12 years (s.d. = 6.28, range 16-55 years). The SPQ was used.
   Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Multilevel CFA (ML-CFA) were used
   to evaluate the factor structure underlying the SPQ scores.
   Results At the SPQ item level, the nine factor and second-order factor
   models showed adequate goodness-of-fit. At the SPQ subscale level,
   three- and four-factor models displayed better goodness-of-fit indices
   than other CFA models. ML-CFA showed that the intraclass correlation
   coefficients values were lower than 0.106. The three-factor model showed
   adequate goodness of fit indices in multilevel analysis. The ordinal
   coefficients were high, ranging from 0.73 to 0.94 across individual
   samples, and from 0.84 to 0.91 for the combined sample.
   Conclusions The results are consistent with the conceptual notion that
   schizotypal personality is a multifaceted construct and support the
   validity and utility of SPQ in cross-cultural research. We discuss
   theoretical and clinical implications of our results for diagnostic
   systems, psychosis models and cross-national mental health strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to detect covert markers of incipient cognitive
   decline among older adults before cognitive decline becomes overtly
   evident on traditional cognitive tests represents an important topic of
   research. Exaggerated reactions to novelty, reflected in novelty-induced
   increases in action planning latencies (novelty effect; NE) and low
   openness to experience (openness), have been previously associated with
   incipient cognitive decline among older adults who appeared cognitively
   normal at baseline. The purposes of the present study were to extend
   prior research on the utility of these markers by examining whether (a)
   NE and openness each predict cognitive change uniquely, and (b) whether
   these indices predict cognitive change above and beyond measures of
   memory, executive functions, processing speed/efficiency, premorbid IQ,
   and depressive symptoms.Method: Sixty-one cognitively normal
   community-dwelling older adults were administered a battery of tests
   assessing the relevant constructs at baseline and one-year follow up.
   Changes in cognitive status were assessed using the Demetia Rating
   Scale, 2nd Edition, NE was assessed using the Push-Turn-Taptap task (an
   electronic motor sequence learning task), and openness using the NEO
   Personality Inventory-Revised. The Test of Premorbid Functioning, and
   subtests from Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
   Neuropsychological Status, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and
   Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th Edition, were used for additional
   assessment of baseline cognition. Depressive symptoms were assessed
   using the Geriatric Depression Scale.Results: Results confirmed our
   hypothesis that both NE and openness contribute to prediction of
   cognitive change beyond baseline cognition and depressive symptoms, but
   none of the covariates (i.e., depression, executive functions,
   processing efficiency, or memory) themselves contributed to the model.
   NE and openness each contributed unique variance and were independent of
   each other.Conclusions: Openness and NE have the potential to provide
   evidence-based methods for estimating risk of future cognitive change in
   persons with currently normal standardized test scores.}},

   (Pentacam HR) in eyes with cataract.Methods: A total of 149 cataractous
   eyes of 149 patients were examined and categorized as low astigmatism
   (<1.0D, N=50), moderate astigmatism (1.0-2.0D, N=49), and high
   astigmatism (>2.0D, N=50). The flattest and the steepest keratometric
   values (Kf and Ks), the magnitude of astigmatism (Ast), the orientation
   of the steepest meridian (Axis), and power vectors J(0) and J(45) were
   compared.Results: Keratometry readings (Kf, Ks, and Km) obtained by the
   Verion system showed statistically significant differences as compared
   to the other three devices. The magnitude of astigmatism (Ast) measured
   by the Verion (1.500.85D) was similar to that measured by the YZ38 (1.45
   +/- 0.82D, P=0.110) and slightly lower than that by the IOLMaster (1.56
   +/- 0.87D, P=0.014), but much higher than that by the Pentacam (1.36 +/-
   0.81D, P=0.000) significantly. However, no statistically significant
   differences were observed in the J(0) and J(45) vectors in the whole

   astigmatism magnitude of 0.50D or more was detected between the Verion
   system and other three devices most commonly in moderate astigmatism
   eyes (16.3-24.5\%). The difference in the location of the steep meridian
   was greater than 10degrees most frequently in the low astigmatism eyes
   (26.0-52.0\%).Conclusions: Keratometric and astigmatic results obtained
   with Verion were not completely interchangeable with those obtained with

   items of the refined scale.
   Findings The results indicate that gender role stereotypes are
   challenged. It seems that the perceived managers' personality is
   comprised of both agentic/masculine and communal/feminine
   characteristics and this perception is not perceived differently by men
   and women. This debates on whether the glass ceiling exists due to other
   determinants.
   Originality/value The study contributes to the literature on gender role
   stereotyping research and perceptions of managerial personality
   characteristics in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
   (RBANS) is a cognitive battery that contains scales of several cognitive

   healthy and clinical normative data are lacking on the frequency of
   these types of errors, making their significance difficult to interpret
   in isolation. The aim of this project was to create an RBANS executive
   errors scale (RBANS EE) with items comprised of qualitatively
   dysexecutive errors committed throughout the test. Participants included
   Veterans referred for outpatient neuropsychological testing. Items were
   initially selected based on theoretical literature and were retained
   based on item-total correlations. The RBANS EE (a percentage calculated
   by dividing the number of dysexecutive errors by the total number of
   responses) was moderately related to each of seven established measures
   of executive functioning and was strongly predictive of dichotomous
   classification of executive impairment. Thus, the scale had solid

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-16}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Piglet vocalization rates are used as welfare indicators. The emission
   rates of the two gross categories of piglet calls, namely low frequency
   calls ({''}grunts{''}) and high frequency calls ({''}screams{''}), may
   contain different information about the piglet's internal state due to
   differing communicative functions of the two call types. More knowledge
   is needed about the sources of variation in calling rates within and
   between piglets. We examined to what extent the emission rates of the
   two call types are codetermined by individual and litter identity, i.e.,
   whether the rates are repeatable within individuals and similar between
   littermates. We recorded frequency of grunts and screams in one mildly
   negative (shortterm Isolation) and one moderately negative (manual
   Restraint) situation during the first week (week 1) and the 4th week
   (week 4) of life and asked the following questions: 1) Are
   within-individual vocalization rates stable across the suckling period?
   2) Are within-individual vocalization rates stable across the two
   situations? 3) Is there within-litter similarity in vocalization rates?
   4) Does this within-litter similarity increase during the suckling
   period? Within-individual vocalization rates were stable between week 1
   and week 4 (grunts in Restraint P < 0.05; grunts in Isolation P < 0.001;
   screams in Restraint P < 0.001; screams in Isolation P < 0.001). Across
   the two situations at the same age, the vocalization rates were not
   stable for grunts but were stable for screams at week 1 and week 4 (P <
   0.05). Vocalization rates were more similar between littermates than
   between piglets belonging to different litters (grunts in Restraint P <
   0.001; grunts in Isolation P < 0.01; screams in Restraint P < 0.001;
   screams in Isolation P < 0.001). This litter effect did not grow
   stronger from week 1 to week 4 as the with-in-litter coefficient of
   variance did not decrease between the two ages. Sex of the piglet had no
   influence on vocalization rates while greater body weight was associated
   with lower screaming rates in the Restraint situation (P < 0.05). In
   conclusion, our study demonstrates that both individuality of the piglet
   and litter identity affect the vocalization rates of piglets in
   negatively valenced situations. For screams, the repeatability of
   individual vocalization rates holds even across situations, while for
   grunts, the rates are repeatable during ontogeny within the situations,

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that more than 47\% of the sports horse population in
   normal work may be lame, but the lameness is not recognized by owners or
   trainers. An alternative means of detecting pain may be recognition of
   behavioral changes in ridden horses. It has been demonstrated that there
   are differences in facial expressions in nonlame and lame horses. The
   purpose of this study was to develop a whole horse ethogram for ridden
   horses and to determine whether it could be applied repeatedly by 1
   observer (repeatability study, 9 horses) and if, by application of a
   related pain behavior score, lame horses (n = 24) and nonlame horses (n
   = 13) could be differentiated. It was hypothesized that there would be
   some overlap in pain behavior scores among nonlame and lame horses; and
   that overall, nonlame horses would have a lower pain behavior score than
   lame horses. The ethogram was developed with 117 behavioral markers, and
   the horses were graded twice in random order by a trained specialist
   using video footage. Overall, there was a good correlation between the 2
   assessments (P < 0.001; R-2 = 0.91). Behavioral markers that were not
   consistent across the 2 assessments were omitted, reducing the ethogram
   to 70 markers. The modified ethogram was applied to video recordings of
   the nonlame horses and lame horses (ethogram evaluation). There was a
   strong correlation between 20 behavioral markers and the presence of
   lameness. The ethogram was subsequently simplified to 24 behavioral
   markers, by the amalgamation of similar behaviors which scored similarly
   and by omission of markers which showed unreliable results in relation
   to lameness. Following this, the maximum individual occurrence score for
   lame horses was 14 (out of 24 possible markers), with a median and mean
   score of 9 (+/- 2 standard deviation) compared with a maximum score of 6
   for nonlame horses, with a median and mean score of 2 (+/- 1.4). For
   lame horses, the following behaviors occurred significantly more (P <
   0.05, chi-square): ears back, mouth opening, tongue out, change in eye
   posture and expression, going above the bit, head tossing, tilting the
   head, unwillingness to go, crookedness, hurrying, changing gait
   spontaneously, poor quality canter, resisting, and stumbling and toe
   dragging. Recognition of these features as potential indicators of
   musculoskeletal pain may enable earlier recognition of lameness and
   avoidance of punishment-based training. Further research is necessary to
   verify this new ethogram for assessment of pain in ridden horses. (C)

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence for consistent among-individual variation in

   into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not

   variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of
   sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree,

   preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences
   in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether
   observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social
   environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in
   social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in
   3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of
   time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found
   that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics

Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of a particular behavioural trait, such as
   boldness or aggression, may vary depending on the physical environment.
   We tested whether the common practice of adding physical structure (i.e.
   boulders) to streams to increase salmonid density has behavioural
   consequences, as open habitats are predicted to favour individuals that
   are more bold and aggressive. Wild young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon
   were captured from habitats of varying physical complexity and placed
   into semi-natural stream enclosures for 11 days while their behaviour
   was observed and tested in both open and structurally complex
   environments. We found evidence for personality, or consistent
   individual behavioural differences across contexts, for avoidance and
   site attachment, with repeatabilities of 0.287 and 0.206, respectively,
   but not for activity or frequency of aggression. Fish were significantly
   more active and aggressive in the open habitats, and more site-attached
   in the complex habitats. Active and aggressive fish also grew more in
   the wild, while site-attached fish grew less in the wild, but more in
   the enclosures. However, contrary to our expectation, the complexity of
   the original habitat was not a significant predictor of personality. Our
   results suggest stream restorations involving increasing habitat
   complexity will alter the behaviour of young-of-the-year Atlantic
   salmon, but will not favour any particular personality types. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The relationship between an individual's cognitive abilities and other

   mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, to investigate the relationship between
   individual associative learning performance in numerical discrimination
   tests and independent measures of activity, exploration, anxiety and
   sociability. We found extensive and highly repeatable inter-individual
   variation in learning performance (r = 0.89; ICC = 0.89). Males and
   females exhibited similar learning performance, yet differed in
   sociability, activity and their relationship between learning and
   anxiety/exploration tendencies. Sex-specific multivariate behaviour
   scores successfully predicted variation in individual learning
   performance, whereas combined sex analyses did not. Female multivariate
   behaviour scores significantly predict learning performance across
   females (rho = 0.80, p = 0.005) with high-performing female learners
   differentiated from female non-learners and low-performing learners by
   significant contributions of activity and sociability measures.
   Meanwhile, males of different learning performance levels (high-, low-
   and non-learners) were distinguished from each other by unique
   behavioural loadings of sociability, activity and anxiety/exploration

Abstract = {{Processing of auditory information in the cortex continues to develop
   into later childhood and adolescence. Recent research has indicated that
   intraclass correlation (ICC) is the best method for capturing maturation
   in auditory event-related potentials (AEPs) of school-age children.
   However, the sensitivity of the ICC approach in discerning AEP changes
   in children has not been consistently demonstrated and positive results
   have not been replicated. We attempted this replication and further
   explored whether AEP maturation estimated using the ICC approach
   predicts cognitive and linguistic abilities in addition to chronological
   age. We measured AEPs in response to simple tones in groups of 7-, 8-,
   9- and 10-year olds with typical development (N=67) and used ICC to
   estimate the age equivalent of each child's AEP (AEP-age). Results
   indicated that ICC differentiated 7- to 8-year-old children from 9- to
   10-year-old children and that AEP-age predicted both chronological age
   and significant, unique variance in language ability, but not in
   nonverbal IQ. Our findings support the view that auditory organization
   in children reflects both general developmental maturation and more
   specific development of language skills, and support the future use of
   AEP-age to identify and understand individual differences in brain
   maturation in typically developing and clinical populations.}},

   three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a
   pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative
   genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and
   in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in

   did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness,
   exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a

   on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no
   consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work
   shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that

Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment,
   and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with
   environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because
   sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences
   group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition.
   Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the
   social environment. The combination of the ecological and social
   environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological
   environment, which could explain variation in fitness.
   2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual
   social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as
   phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological
   environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of
   individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat
   selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may
   reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and
   social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment
   framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches.
   Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent,
   and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect
   reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.
   3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat
   selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive,
   consequences associated with changes in population density. The
   ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed
   socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density
   could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For
   instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population
   density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial
   phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual
   framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural
   traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and
   evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the
   socioecological environment.}},

Title = {{Aggression supersedes individual oxygen demand to drive group
   air-breathing in a social catfish}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{1. Group-living is widespread among animals and comes with numerous
   costs and benefits. To date, research examining group-living has focused
   on trade-offs surrounding foraging, while other forms of resource
   acquisition have been largely overlooked.
   2. Air-breathing has evolved in many fish lineages, allowing animals to
   obtain oxygen in hypoxic aquatic environments. Breathing air increases
   the threat of predation, so some species perform group air-breathing, to
   reduce individual risk. Within species, individual air-breathing can be
   influenced by metabolic rate as well as personality, but the mechanisms
   of group air-breathing remain unexplored. It is conceivable that
   keystone individuals with high metabolic demand or intrinsic tendency to
   breathe air may drive social breathing, especially in hypoxia.
   3. We examined social air-breathing in African sharptooth catfish
   Clarias gariepinus, to determine whether individual physiological traits
   and spontaneous tendency to breathe air influence the behaviour of
   entire groups, and whether such influences vary in relation to aquatic
   oxygen availability.
   4. We studied 11 groups of four catfish in a laboratory arena and
   recorded air-breathing behaviour, activity and agonistic interactions at
   varying levels of hypoxia. Bimodal respirometry was used to estimate
   individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and the tendency to utilize
   aerial oxygen when alone.
   5. Fish took more air breaths in groups as compared to when they were
   alone, regardless of water oxygen content, and displayed temporally
   clustered air-breathing behaviour, consistent with existing definitions
   of synchronous air-breathing. However, groups displayed tremendous
   variability in surfacing behaviour. Aggression by dominant individuals
   within groups was the main factor influencing air-breathing of the
   entire group. There was no association between individual SMR, or the
   tendency to obtain oxygen from air when in isolation, and group
   air-breathing.
   6. For C. gariepinus, synchronous air-breathing is strongly influenced
   by agonistic interactions, which may expose subordinate individuals to
   risk of predation. Influential individuals exerted an overriding effect
   on risk-taking by the entire group, for reasons independent of their
   physiological oxygen requirements. Overall, this illustrates that social
   context can obscure interactions between an individual's physiological
   and behavioural traits and their tendency to take risks to obtain
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The relative reinforcing value of food versus engagement in other
   behaviors may be related to the development of obesity, and
   interventions to reduce FRR may prevent the development of obesity. Our
   laboratory recently developed a paradigm to measure the reinforcing
   value of food versus an alternative behavior (i.e., playing with
   bubbles) in infants using a computerized laboratory task, during which
   infants press a button to earn reinforcers following a progressive ratio
   schedule of reinforcement. The primary purpose of this study was to
   examine the short-term (within 2 weeks) repeatability of this measure,
   specifically the outcome of infant food reinforcing ratio (FRR), or how
   hard infants will work for food relative to the alternative. The
   secondary aim was to examine whether infant age and temperament
   dimensions related to novelty responsiveness (high intensity pleasure
   and approach) moderated the repeatability of FRR. Thirty-seven infants
   aged 9-18 months completed this study. Repeated measures analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) showed no differences between time 1 and time 2 in
   responding for food (F = 0.463, p = 0.501), bubbles (F = 1.793, p =
   0.189), or overall FRR (F = 0.797, p = 0.378). Regression models showed
   the association between BUB P-max at time 1 and time 2 were moderated by
   infant age (p = 0.04), with greater repeatability in older infants.
   Linear regression models also demonstrated that the infant temperamental
   dimension of high intensity pleasure significantly predicted BUB Pmax at
   time 1 (beta = 2.89, p = 0.01), but not at time 2. Overall, our findings
   support the repeatability of this measure for food portion of the
   reinforcement task, but demonstrated that the measure of non-food
   portion of the task required modification, in particular among children
   younger than 13 months old. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Predators exploiting tropical pelagic waters characterised by low
   fluctuations in seasonal temperature and salinity may require different
   foraging strategies than predators that can rely on persistently
   productive marine features. Consistent individual differences in
   foraging strategies have been found in temperate seabirds, but it is
   unclear whether such foraging specialisation would be beneficial in
   unpredictable tropical pelagic waters. We examined whether foraging trip
   characteristics of a tropical seabird were consistent between seasons
   and within individuals and explored whether seasonal changes could be
   explained by environmental variables. Ascension frigatebird Fregata
   aquila trips lasted up to 18 d and covered a total travel distance of up
   to 7047 km, but adult frigatebirds stayed within a radius of 1150 km of
   Ascension Island. We found that the 50\% utilisation distribution of the
   population expanded southwestward in the cool season due to individuals
   performing more and longer trips in a southerly and westerly direction
   during the cool compared to the hot season. Individual repeatability was
   low (R < 0.25) for all trip characteristics, and we were unable to
   explain seasonal changes in time spent at sea using oceano graphic or
   atmospheric variables. Instead, frigatebird usage per area was almost
   exclusively determined by distance from the colony, and although
   individuals spent more time in distant portions of their foraging trips,
   the amount of time spent per unit area decreased exponentially with in
   creasing distance from the colony. This study indicates that, in a
   relatively featureless environment, high individual consistency may not
   be a beneficial trait for pelagic predators.}},

Title = {{Intraindividual Behavioral Variability Predicts Foraging Outcome in a
   Beach-dwelling Jumping Spider}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent differences between
   individuals in behavior, has been the subject of hundreds if not
   thousands of papers. However, little work explores the fitness
   consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or
   intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral
   IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping
   spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders
   with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more
   variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV
   would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we
   tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level,
   and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in
   spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively
   correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the
   number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed
   a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly,
   average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of
   foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of
   success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that
   IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of
   predator-prey interactions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Individuals who are well integrated into society have greater access to
   resources and tend to live longer. Why some individuals are socially
   isolated and others are not is therefore puzzling from an evolutionary
   perspective. Answering this question requires establishing the mix of
   intrinsic and contextual factors that contribute to social isolation.
   Using social network data spanning up to half of the median adult
   lifespan in a gregarious primate, we found that some measures of social
   isolation were modestly repeatable within individuals, consistent with a
   trait. By contrast, social isolation was not explained by the identity
   of an animal's mother or the group into which it was born. Nevertheless,
   age, sex and social status each played a role, as did kin dynamics and
   familiarity. Females with fewer close relatives were more isolated, and
   the more time males spent in a new group the less isolated they became,
   independent of their social status. These results show that social
   isolation results from a combination of intrinsic and environmental
   factors. From an evolutionary perspective, these findings suggest that
   social isolation could be adaptive in some contexts and partly
   maintained by selection.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism, behaviour and growth are highly flexible in fish species,
   and inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and
   ecologically significant. It has long been suggested that these traits
   co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study,
   we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential
   relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid
   carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e.
   activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and
   after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a
   day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group
   showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed
   fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing.
   Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher
   feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar
   specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was
   affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and
   exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the
   group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in
   the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality
   traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with
   FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the
   twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that
   food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and
   ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between
   metabolism and growth.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict
   chronological age in healthy people. Deviations from healthy brain
   ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here
   we sought to further establish the credentials of `brain-predicted age'
   as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process,
   using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, and
   specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to both
   pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data.
   Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age
   using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to
   establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of
   monozygotic and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined
   the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age
   using two samples (within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN
   brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process
   Regression (GPR) approach, on all datasets. Input data were grey matter
   (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps generated by Statistical
   Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data.
   CNN accurately predicted chronological age using GM (correlation between
   brain-predicted age and chronological age r = 0.96, mean absolute error
   {[}MAE] = 4.16 years) and raw (r = 0.94, MAE = 4.65 years) data. This
   was comparable to GPR brain-predicted age using GM data (r = 0.95, MAE =
   4.66 years). Brain-predicted age was a heritable phenotype for all
   models and input data (h(2) >= 0.5). Brain-predicted age showed high
   test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient {[}ICC] =
   0.90-0.99). Multi-centre reliability was more variable within high ICCs
   for GM (0.83-0.96) and poor-moderate levels for WM and raw data
   (0.51-0.77).
   Brain-predicted age represents an accurate, highly reliable and
   genetically-influenced phenotype, that has potential to be used as a
   biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age predictions can be accurately
   generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially reducing computation time
   for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving realtime
   information on brain health in clinical settings.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Globally increasing urbanization causes major anthropogenic changes in
   ecosystems, drastically altering phenotypes of organisms. Increased
   contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on
   behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality,
   consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been
   investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in
   personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter
   community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a
   sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two
   personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects
   between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the
   damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three
   distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of
   behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural
   correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide
   treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation
   (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability.
   Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on
   urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide
   exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a
   behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae
   appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness
   syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These
   differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained
   by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of
   urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban
   habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring
   behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant
   effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may
   play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of
   animal personalities in natural populations. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{1. In social contexts, animal behaviour is often studied in terms of
   group-level characteristics. One clear example of this is the collective
   motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and
   fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level
   behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few
   methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often
   limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to
   experimental data.
   2. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals
   according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even
   tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to
   behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are
   rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations
   of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this
   method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a
   variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each
   case.
   3. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute
   equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the
   between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for
   groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group
   feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across
   the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how
   individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the
   experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level
   repeatability of the underlying traits.
   4. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in
   social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals.
   Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons
   between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the
   behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for
   testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups
   or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially
   relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments,
   and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method
   provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence
   social behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Assortative mating in wild populations is commonly reported as the
   correlation between males' and females' phenotypes across mated pairs.
   Theories of partner selection and quantitative genetics assume that
   phenotypic resemblance of partners captures associations in
   intrinsically determined trait values. However, when considering traits
   with a repeatability below one (labile traits or traits measured with
   error), the correlation between phenotypes of paired individuals can
   arise from shared environmental effects on the phenotypes of paired
   individuals or correlated measurement error. We introduce statistical
   approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits or traits
   measured with error in the presence of shared environmental effects.
   These approaches include (1) the correlation between the mean phenotypes
   of males and females, (2) the correlation between randomized values of
   individuals and (3) the between-pair correlation derived from a
   bivariate mixed model. We use simulations to show that the performance
   of these different approaches depends on the number of repeated measures
   within individuals or pairs, which is determined by study design, and
   rates of survival and divorce. We conclude that short-term environmental
   effects on phenotypes of paired individuals likely inflate estimates of
   assortative mating when not statistically accounted for. Our approach
   allows investigation of this important issue in assortative mating
   studies for labile traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology, or metabolism) in
   both socially monogamous and other mating systems, and groupings of
   individuals outside a mating context.}},

Abstract = {{Stress is ubiquitous in nature and organisms have evolved mechanisms to
   cope with it. Stress responses nevertheless vary based on the type of
   stress, its duration, magnitude, and the organism's physiological
   status. We studied here the effect of two separately applied stress
   types, differing also in their duration, on various behavioral responses
   of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The two stress types
   applied were short-term cold stress and long-term low protein stress.
   The behavioral response variables were movement activity, preference to
   move along the test arena edges, latency to emerge from shelter, and
   preference for dark microhabitat, measured at two stages of the beetles'
   lives, as young adults after eclosion and one month later. Behavioral
   responses were stress-specific. Cold-stressed beetles moved over the
   longest distances but were also the most reluctant to leave an
   accessible shelter. We interpret this to mean that cold-stressed beetles
   were the most active under unfavorable conditions and least bold under
   more favorable, protected conditions. As beetles aged, their movement
   activity decreased and latency to emerge from shelter increased.
   Non-stressed beetles were the most consistent in their behavior across
   all behavioral tests. This finding is similar to those in previous
   studies and suggests that moderate stress reduces behavioral
   consistency. While all beetles gained mass during the study period, the
   two stress types led to different patterns of body mass increase, which
   was more moderate for cold stressed than for protein-stressed beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Personality research has been focused on different aspects of the self,
   including traits, attitudes, beliefs, goals, and motivation. These
   aspects of the self are used to explain and predict social behaviour.
   The present research assessed generalized beliefs about the world,
   termed social axioms' (Leung etal., ), and examined their additive power
   over beliefs about the self in explaining a communal behaviour, that is,
   modesty. Three studies predicted reported modest behaviour among
   Mainland Chinese, Hong Kong Chinese, East Asian Canadians, and European
   Canadians. In addition to self-reports in Studies 1 and 2, informant
   reports from participants' parents and close friends were collected in
   Study 3 to construct a behavioural composite after examining the
   resulting multitrait-multimethod matrix and intraclass correlations.
   World views (operationalized as social axioms) explained additional
   variance in modest behaviour over and above self-views (operationalized
   as self-efficacy, self-construals, and trait modesty) in both Eastern
   and Western cultures. Variation in reports on three factors of modest
   behaviour was found across self-, parent, and friend perspectives, with
   significant differences across perspectives in self-effacement and
   other-enhancement, but not in avoidance of attention-seeking.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the extent of repeatable differences in the behavior of
   animals and the factors that influence behavioral expression is
   important for understanding individual fitness and population processes,
   thereby aiding in species conservation. However, little is known about
   the causes of variation in the repeatability of behavioral differences
   among species because rarely have comparative studies been undertaken to
   examine the repeatability of behavioral differences among individuals
   within their natural ecological settings. Using two species of endemic
   subtropical anemonefishes, Amphiprion mccullochi and A. latezonatus at
   Lord Howe and North Solitary Islands, Australia, we conducted an in situ
   comparative analysis of personality traits, examining the repeatability
   of boldness, sociability and aggression as well as the potential role of
   environmental and social factors on behavioral expression. For A.
   mccullochi, only boldness and aggression were highly repeatable and
   these behaviors formed a behavioral syndrome. For A. latezonatus, none
   of the three behaviors were repeatable due to low-inter-individual
   variation in behavior. We suggest that the harsher and more variable
   environmental and social conditions experienced by A. latezonatus have
   resulted in reduced repeatability in behavior, in contrast to A.
   mccullochi which typically inhabits a more stable lagoonal reef
   environment. Additionally, group size and size rank, rather than
   nearest-neighbor distance and anemone size, influenced the expression of
   these behaviors in both species, suggesting that behavioral variation
   was more sensitive to social than environmental factors. Overall,
   differences in repeatability between these closely related species
   likely reflect adaptations to contrasting environmental and social
   conditions, although alternative explanations must be considered. The
   differences in behavioral consistency between these two endemic
   anemonefishes could lead to disparity in their resilience to
   environmental or social change in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits and behavioural profiles are generally assumed to be
   stable in adulthood. Yet, it has been hypothesised that animals should
   cope with cyclical fluctuations by adjusting both single behaviours and
   suites of behaviour. Photoperiod is well known to induce hormonal and
   physiological changes, and these changes can in turn affect personality
   traits and behavioural profiles. This study is the first to explicitly
   investigate the influence of photoperiod on both behavioural profiles
   and personality traits. Six potential personality traits (within-flock
   activity, ability to escape, response to threat, isolation calling,
   boldness and neophobia) and dominance were measured four times in 96
   domestic canaries Serinus canaria (48 males and 48 females): twice
   during a long photoperiod (Long Days) and 6months later twice during a
   short photoperiod (Short Days). Without regard to sex and photoperiod,
   most traits were highly repeatable, and bolder canaries were more
   dominant, less sensitive to an external threat and to isolation and less
   neophobic. In addition, the more active individuals within a flock were
   the more difficult to catch. Yet, both sex and photoperiod affected
   personality traits and behavioural profiles. Personality traits remained
   repeatable within each photoperiod though we observed behavioural
   plasticity and sex differences for response to threat, neophobia and
   within-flock activity. Concerning behavioural profiles, the negative
   relationship between boldness and neophobia remained homogenous in both
   sexes during Short Days as well as during Long Days. Then, the more
   active individuals within a flock were the more difficult to catch in
   Short Days but not in Long Days. Finally, the other correlations not
   only varied with photoperiod but also with sex. Our study highlights the
   importance of photoperiod and sex in the expression of personality
   traits and behavioural profiles, and of the need to measure them across
   the whole photoperiodic cycle.}},

Abstract = {{In passively operated fishing gear, boldness-related behaviors should
   fundamentally affect the vulnerability of individual fish and thus be
   under fisheries selection. To test this hypothesis, we used juvenile
   common-garden reared carp (Cyprinus carpio) within a narrow size range
   to investigate the mechanistic basis of behavioral selection caused by
   angling. We focused on one key personality trait (i.e., boldness),
   measured in groups within ponds, two morphological traits (body shape
   and head shape), and one life-history trait (juvenile growth capacity)
   and studied mean standardized selection gradients caused by angling.
   Carp behavior was highly repeatable within ponds. In the short term,
   over seven days of fishing, total length, not boldness, was the main
   predictor of angling vulnerability. However, after 20 days of fishing,
   boldness turned out to be the main trait under selection, followed by
   juvenile growth rate, while morphological traits were only weakly
   related to angling vulnerability. In addition, we found juvenile growth
   rate to be moderately correlated with boldness. Hence, direct selection
   on boldness will also induce indirect selection on juvenile growth and
   vice versa, but given that the two traits are not perfectly correlated,
   independent evolution of both traits is also possible. Our study is
   among the first to mechanistically reveal that
   energy-acquisition-related behaviors, and not growth rate per se, are
   key factors determining the probability of capture, and hence,
   behavioral traits appear to be the prime targets of angling selection.
   We predict an evolutionary response toward increased shyness in
   intensively angling-exploited fish stocks, possibly causing the
   emergence of a timidity syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Mating in arthropods is costly and has negative effects on survival.
   Such effects are often more strongly expressed when individuals are
   simultaneously exposed to other stress sources. Consequently, the
   behaviour of virgin and mated individuals often differs. Mated females,
   for example, search for suitable oviposition sites, whereas virgin
   females search more for mates. In the present study, we examine the
   effect of mating separately for females and males on four key behaviours
   of the red flour beetles: movement activity, movement along the edges of
   an arena, latency to emerge from shelter and preference for dark
   microhabitat. After mating, both sexes increase their activity at the
   same time as moving less along the arena edge, leading to a change in
   movement pattern. Females possibly change their movement pattern to
   locate suitable oviposition sites, whereas males perhaps do so to detect
   additional females with which to mate. Latency to emerge from shelter
   and dark preference are not influenced by mating, although they increase
   when measured again after 1week. Of these behaviours, only movement
   activity is consistent at the individual level. We also examine whether
   mating incurs a cost as expressed in the time required to recover from a
   chill-coma. The latter is a common proxy of cold tolerance in
   ectotherms. By contrast to our prediction, mating has no effect on
   chill-coma recovery time, suggesting that either a single mating event
   does not incur sufficient stress or that there is possibly no trade-off
   between the energetic cost of mating and of cold tolerance.}},

   Mouse Strains}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness in response to a standardized
   exercise training protocol differ substantially between individuals.
   Results from cross-sectional, twin, and family studies indicate genetics
   contribute to individual differences in both baseline exercise capacity
   and the response to training. Exercise capacity and responses to
   training also vary between inbred strains of mice. However, such studies
   have utilized a limited number of inbred strains. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to characterize exercise-training responses in a larger
   number of genetically diverse strains of inbred mice and estimate the
   contribution of genetic background to exercise training responses.
   Eight-week old male mice from 24 inbred strains (n = 4-10/strain)
   performed a graded exercise test before and after 4 weeks of exercise
   training. Before training, exercise capacity was significantly different
   between strains when expressed as time (range = 21-42min) and work
   performed (range = 0.42-3.89 kg.m). The responses to training also were
   significantly different between strains, ranging from a decrease of
   2.2min in NON/ShiLtJ mice to an increase of 8.7min in SWR/J mice.
   Changes in work also varied considerably between the lowest (-0.24 kg.m
   in NON/ShiLtJ) and highest (+ 2.30 kg.min FVB/NJ) performing strains.
   Heart and skeletal muscle masses also varied significantly between
   strains. Two broad sense heritability estimates were calculated for each
   measure of exercise capacity and for responses to training. For change
   in run time, the intraclass correlation between mice within the same
   inbred strain (r(1)) was 0.58 and the coefficient of genetic
   determination (g(2)) was 0.41. Heritability estimates were similar for
   the change in work: r(1) = 0.54 and g(2) = 0.37. In conclusion, these
   results indicate genetic background significantly influences responses
   to exercise training.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsivity has mainly been described as a negative or dysfunctional
   characteristic associated with several disorders. However, impulsivity
   is not only related to dysfunctional outcomes and may explain individual

   Translation and cultural adaptation followed a rigorous process, which
   relied on an expert panel in the cross-cultural adaptation of

   obtained for the Brazilian version of the DII (Br-DII). The 23 items of
   the Br-DII was considered unsuitable according to model fit indices of

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{This study examines whether coding open answers in a picture-based test,
   as to the extent they reflect the fear of being laughed at (i.e.,
   gelotophobia), demonstrates sufficient validity to construct a
   semi-projective test for the assessment of gelotophobia. Previous
   findings indicate that cartoon stimuli depicting laughter situations
   (i.e., in the pilot version of the Picture-Geloph; Ruch et al., 2009) on
   average elicit fear-typical responses in gelotophobes stronger than in
   non-gelotophobes. The present study aims to (a) develop a standardized
   scoring procedure based on a coding scheme, and (b) examine the
   properties of the pilot version of the Picture-Geloph in order to select
   the most acceptable items for a standard form of the test. For Study 1,
   a sample of N = 126 adults, with scores evenly distributed across the
   gelotophobia spectrum, completed the pilot version of the Picture-Geloph
   by noting down what they assumed the protagonist in each of 20 cartoons
   would say or think. Furthermore, participants answered the
   GELOPH<15>(Ruch and Proyer, 2008), the established questionnaire for the
   subjective assessment of the fear of being laughed at. Agreement between
   two independent raters indicated that the developed coding scheme allows
   for objective and reliable scoring of the Picture-Geloph (mean of
   intraclass correlations = 0.66). Nine items met the criteria employed to
   identify the psychometrically most reliable and valid items. These items
   were unidimensional and internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78).
   The total score of this selection (i.e., the Picture-Geloph<9>)
   discriminated significantly between non-fearful, slightly, markedly, and
   extremely fearful individuals; furthermore, it correlated sufficiently
   high (r = 0.66; r(c)= 0.79 when corrected for reliability of both
   measures) with the GELOPH<15>. Cronbach's alpha (0.73) was largely
   comparable whereas the estimate of convergent validity was found to be
   lower in one (r = 0.50; r(c)= 0.61; N = 103) of the two samples in Study
   2. Combining all three samples (N = 313) yielded a linear relationship
   between the self-report and the Picture-Geloph. With the
   Picture-Geloph<9>and the developed coding scheme, an unobtrusive and
   valid alternative instrument for the assessment of gelotophobia is
   provided. Possible applications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and
   maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population
   in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome)
   behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that
   behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition,
   gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through
   behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are
   labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to
   be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term
   environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood
   remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory
   experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time
   available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on
   activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green
   lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of
   behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency
   (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation
   for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean
   behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual
   behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments.
   Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found
   significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long
   basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but
   affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher
   in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size
   (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking
   treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when
   food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change
   can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect
   could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural
   predictability, but not in behavioural type.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The interval from J-point to T-wave peak (JTp) in ECG is a
   new biomarker able to identify drugs that prolong the QT interval but
   have different ion channel effects. If JTp is not prolonged, the
   prolonged QT may be associated with multi ion channel block that may
   have low torsade de pointes risk. From the automatic ECG measurement
   perspective, accurate and repeatable measurement of JTp involves
   different challenges than QT. We evaluated algorithm performance and JTp
   challenges using the Philips DXL diagnostic 12/16/18-lead algorithm.
   Measurement of JTp represents a different use model. Standard use of
   corrected QT interval is clinical risk assessment on patients with
   cardiac disease or suspicion of heart disease. Drug safety trials
   involve a very different population- young healthy subjects- who
   commonly have J-waves, notches and slurs. Drug effects include difficult
   and unusual morphology such as flat T-waves, gentle notches, and
   multiple T-wave peaks.
   Methods: The JTp initiative study provided ECGs collected from 22 young
   subjects (11 males and females) in randomized testing of dofetilide,
   quinidine, ranolazine, verapamil and placebo. We compare the JTp
   intervals between DXL algorithm and the FDA published measurements. The
   lead wise, vector-magnitude (VM), root-mean-square (RMS) and
   principal-component-analysis (PCA) representative beats were used to
   measure JTp and QT intervals. We also implemented four different methods
   for T peak detection for comparison.
   Results: We found that JTp measurements were closer to the reference for
   combined leads RMS and PCA than individual leads. Differences in J-point
   location led to part of the JTp measurement difference because of the
   high prevalence of J-waves, notches and slurs. Larger differences were
   noted for drug effect causing multiple distinct T-wave peaks (Tp). The
   automated algorithm chooses the later peak while the reference was the
   earlier peak. Choosing among different algorithmic strategies in T peak
   measurement results in the tradeoff between stability and the accurate
   detection of calcium or sodium channel block.
   Conclusion: Measurement of JTp has different challenges than QT
   measurement. JTp measurement accuracy improved with combined leads RMS
   and PCA over lead II or V5. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   divided in two blocks (test and retest). Each block consisted of one
   exercise and one control session. BP pressure was measured before and
   after the interventions. The presence of systematic error (paired
   t-tests), reliability {[}intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC)], and
   agreement {[}typical error (TE) and minimal detectable difference (MDD)]
   were evaluated. PEHs calculated by the three methods were similar
   between test and retest. For systolic PEH, ICC was>0.74, TE ranged from
   2.6 to 4.6mmHg and MDD from 7.2 to 12.8mmHg for the three methods. For
   diastolic PEH, ICC was<0.48, TE ranged from 3.5 to 5.6mmHg and MDD from
   9.8 to 15.4mmHg for the three methods. Thus, systolic PEH calculated by
   the three methods has good/excellent reliability, while diastolic PEH
   has fair/poor reliability. Regarding agreement, TE and MDD varied among
   the methods, which implies that the specific parameters given for each
   method should be used to estimate sample sizes for studies and the
   minimal individual difference considered real when comparing PEHs.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing recognition of the role of individual variation in
   patterns emerging at higher levels of biological organization. Despite
   the importance of the temporal configuration of ecological processes and
   patterns, intraspecific individual variation in diel activity patterns
   is almost never accounted for in behavioral studies at the population
   level. We used individual-based monitoring data from 98 GPS-collared
   brown bears in Scandinavia to estimate diel activity patterns before the
   fall hunting season. We extracted 7 activity measures related to timing
   and regularity of activity from individual activity profiles. We then
   used multivariate analysis to test for the existence of distinct
   activity tactics and their environmental determinants, followed by
   generalized linear regression to estimate the extent of
   within-individual repeatability of activity tactics. We detected 4
   distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to
   a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging
   habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity
   tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road
   densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to
   rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to
   more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods. We did not
   find evidence of diel activity tactics influencing survival during the
   subsequent hunting season. We conclude that individual variation in
   activity deserves greater attention than it currently receives, as it
   may help account for individual heterogeneity in fitness and could
   facilitate within-population niche partitioning that can have
   population-or community-level consequences.}},

   regarding the form and content of the instrument. Thirty-eight DM1
   patients were subsequently recruited to test the reliability and
   concurrent validity of the instrument by serially completing the MDHI

   consistency was excellent in the total Italian MDHI score and acceptable
   in all of its subscales; the test-retest reliability was high
   (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95); Italian MDHI total scores
   and subscales were associated with neuromuscular function, cognitive and

Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in identifying specific causes and
   consequences of variation in individual social behaviour as a means of
   understanding how different individuals balance the costs and benefits
   of group living. In this study, we used social networks to examine
   variation in individual social behaviour in wild Grant's gazelles,
   Nanger granti, and explored potential drivers and consequences of this
   variation. First, we quantified two aspects of individual network
   position (weighted degree and closeness) on a monthly basis for 12
   consecutive months and examined life-history (age) and abiotic
   (rainfall) factors that could explain among-individual variation in
   network position. Next, we examined the level of within-individual
   repeatability in network position over time. We then tested for
   potential consequences of this variation focusing on parasite infection
   and diet quality. Rainfall and age were strong predictors of variation
   in closeness but not degree. Interestingly, we found that one aspect of
   individual network position (closeness) varied over time, while another
   (degree) was moderately repeatable. The difference in within-individual
   repeatability of the two measures may be explained by the dependence of
   closeness on rainfall. In addition, we found that individual network
   position had consequences for both parasitism and diet, but the
   magnitude and direction of these effects depended on parasite type,
   connectivity measure and environmental conditions. Overall, our results
   suggest that environmental and host factors strongly influence
   variability in certain aspects of social connectivity in Grant's
   gazelles, and that abiotic and biotic forces, together, mediate the
   consequences of social network position. (C) 2017 The Association for

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1639-1644}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are
   fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of
   measurements and for understanding the structure of biological
   variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for
   estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance
   testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification
   of uncertainty is not as easily achieved.
   2. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data
   with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and
   the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian
   models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability
   for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs).
   3.Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R
   for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in
   estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance
   testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation
   of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the
   estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect
   variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that
   add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore,
   repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package
   features convenient summary and plotting functions.
   4.Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of
   coefficients of determination R-2 as well as of raw variance components.
   We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and
   discuss some of the limitations of rptR.}},

Title = {{How to measure dairy cows' responsiveness towards humans in breeding and

   existing breeding traits}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{196}},

Abstract = {{For dairy cattle breeding as well as animal welfare science reliability
   and validity issues regarding measures of cows' responsiveness towards
   humans are relevant. The objective of this study was to investigate
   reliability and validity aspects of four selected behavioural measures
   at the feeding gate (BM) and to compare them with existing breeding
   traits and with observations of cows' behaviour during milking. This
   included the analysis of criterion validity at animal and at herd level
   and of repeatability of the BM over time. Data on avoidance distances
   (AD), tolerance to tactile interaction (TTI), release behaviour (RB),
   and qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were collected on a total of
   33 dairy farms. The breeding traits average milk flow (AMF), milking
   speed (MS), and milking temperament (MT) had been recorded per test-day
   or during linear description by milk testing or breeding associations.
   Inter- and intra-test associations were investigated by Spearman rank or
   Pearson correlation analysis. At animal level, significant correlations
   of different strengths were found within BM ranging from r(s) = 0.28 (p
   < 0.01, n = 1890) between AD and TTI to r(s) = 0.74 (p < 0.01, n = 582)
   between RB and QBA, and between MS and MT (rs = 0.62, p < 0.01, n =
   269). No significant correlations were found between BM and breeding
   traits. For analyses at herd level, medians and percentages of certain
   categories were calculated and the average number of stepping (STEP) and
   kicking (KICK) per cow during milking was recorded. Between all BM
   closer correlations were found than at animal level. STEP correlated
   with KICK (r(s) = 0.80, p < 0.01, n = 24), while no further significant
   correlations were found between BM, STEP or KICK and breeding traits.
   For analysis of repeatability BM were applied repeatedly on three farms
   following a three-week interval. Correlations ranged from r(s) = 0.33 (p
   < 0.01, n = 67) for TTI to r(s) = 0.73 (p < 0.01, n = 23) for QBA.
   Apparently, behavioural measures at the feeding gate reflect partly
   similar and partly different aspects of cows' responsiveness towards
   humans. The present study underlines methodological problems that exist
   with MT and MS, and questions the relationship between milkability,
   milking behaviour and responsiveness in the barn. The analyses show that
   AD, TTI, and RB appear to be vulnerable to short- or mid-term
   influences. Overall, QBA turned out to be a promising measure for
   breeding and welfare assessment.}},

Title = {{Performance of wild brown trout in relation to energetic state and

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which
   individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size,
   energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in
   the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout.
   In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown
   trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the
   laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but
   not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the
   fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1
   month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully
   compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued
   growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural
   environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual
   baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food
   restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by
   growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive
   association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by
   recapture probability), but no significant differences between
   food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively
   influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in
   the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption
   that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments.
   For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with
   high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to
   high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and
   reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk.
   Significance statement
   In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better
   survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the
   balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due
   to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals
   can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely
   limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as
   growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab,
   but not realized in natural streams.}},

   Materials and Methods In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, TA was
   performed on sagittal CT bone images of the thoracic and lumbar spine
   using dedicated software (MaZda) in 141 individuals with normal DXA BMD
   findings. Numbers of female and male subjects were balanced in each of
   six age decades. Three hundred and five TA features were analyzed in
   thoracic and lumbar vertebrae using free-hand regions-of-interest.
   Intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients were calculated for
   determining intra- and inter-observer agreement of each feature. Further
   dimension reduction was performed with correlation analyses.
   Results The TA features with an ICC < 0.81 indicating compromised intra-
   and inter-observer agreement and with Pearson correlation scores r > 0.8
   with other features were excluded from further analysis for dimension
   reduction. From the remaining 31 texture features, a significant
   correlation with age was found for the features mean (r = -0.489, p <

   were found between genders for various higher-level texture features (p

Abstract = {{An emerging hypothesis of animal personality posits that animals choose
   the habitat that best fits their personality, and that the match between
   habitat and personality can facilitate population differentiation, and
   eventually speciation. However, behavioural plasticity and the
   adjustment of behaviours to new environments have been a classical
   explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks
   (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or
   behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of
   shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found
   evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human
   disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age.
   Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of
   individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very
   little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a
   possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of
   developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as `personality'.
   Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in
   shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of
   personality-mediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat
   choice has important implications for population management and

   rate variability}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{The growing interest in personalized medicine requires making inferences
   from descriptive indexes estimated from individual recordings of
   physiological signals, with statistical analyses focused on individual
   differences between/within subjects, rather than comparing supposedly
   homogeneous cohorts. To this end, methods to compute confidence limits
   of individual estimates of descriptive indexes are needed. This study
   introduces numerical methods to compute such confidence limits and
   perform statistical comparisons between indexes derived from
   autoregressive (AR) modeling of individual time series. Analytical
   approaches are generally not viable, because the indexes are usually
   nonlinear functions of the AR parameters. We exploit Monte Carlo (MC)
   and Bootstrap (BS) methods to reproduce the sampling distribution of the
   AR parameters and indexes computed from them. Here, these methods are
   implemented for spectral and information-theoretic indexes of heart-rate
   variability (HRV) estimated from AR models of heart-period time series.
   First, the MS and BC methods are tested in a wide range of synthetic HRV
   time series, showing good agreement with a gold-standard approach (i.e.
   multiple realizations of the ``true{''} process driving the simulation).
   Then, real HRV time series measured from volunteers performing cognitive
   tasks are considered, documenting (i) the strong variability of
   confidence limits' width across recordings, (ii) the diversity of
   individual responses to the same task, and (iii) frequent disagreement
   between the cohort-average response and that of many individuals. We
   conclude that MC and BS methods are robust in estimating confidence
   limits of these AR-based indexes and thus recommended for short-term HRV
   analysis. Moreover, the strong inter-individual differences in the
   response to tasks shown by AR-based indexes evidence the need of
   individual-by-individual assessments of HRV features. Given their
   generality, MC and BS methods are promising for applications in
   biomedical signal processing and beyond, providing a powerful new tool
   for assessing the confidence limits of indexes estimated from individual
   recordings.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological research and clinical practice rely heavily on
   psychometric testing for measuring psychological constructs that
   represent symptoms of psychopathology, individual difference
   characteristics, or cognitive profiles. Test-retest reliability
   assessment is crucial in the development of psychometric tools, helping
   to ensure that measurement variation is due to replicable differences
   between people regardless of time, target behavior, or user profile.
   While psychological studies testing the reliability of measurement tools
   are pervasive in the literature, many still discuss and assess this form
   of reliability inappropriately with regard to the specified aims of the
   study or the intended use of the tool. The current paper outlines
   important factors to consider in test-retest reliability analyses,
   common errors, and some initial methods for conducting and reporting
   reliability analyses to avoid such errors. The paper aims to highlight a
   persistently problematic area in psychological assessment, to illustrate
   the real-world impact that these problems can have on measurement
   validity, and to offer relatively simple methods for improving the
   validity and practical use of reliability statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding of cattle with docile temperament can simplify routine
   practices and enhance welfare of cattle in common production systems.
   The aim of the study was to compare and validate some aspects of
   assessment methods for temperament traits in cattle for their potential
   use in breeding programmes. Calves of different beef and dairy cattle
   breeds were video-recorded during a 2 min tethering (n = 160) and a 2
   min crush test (n = 185) at the age of 38 +/- 25 days. Subsequently, two
   observers blinded to the identity of records each analysed the video
   clips three times with the software Interact in intervals of 1-2 days
   between viewings. Frequency and duration of behaviour patterns such as
   head movement, tail flicking or defecation were recorded. In addition,
   each behaviour pattern was assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale
   (VAS) and in the end of each observation an overall behaviour score on a
   numerical scale from 1 to 5 and on a VAS was assigned to each animal.
   Using variance components from mixed model analysis, results revealed
   that both inter- and intra-observer reliability (OR) were similar or
   superior for the majority of behaviour patterns when assessed with the
   VAS compared to the more time-consuming assessment of exact frequencies
   and durations (e.g. Intra-OR `tail flicking': Observer I: r(VAS) = 0.83
   and r(Freq), = 0.26; Observer II: r(VAS) = 0.91, r(Freq) = 0.37 and
   r(Dur) = 0.87 for the tethering test; Inter-OR `body movement': r(VAS) =
   0.81 and r(Freq) = 0.33 for the crush test). The overall behaviour score
   showed a high infra-observer reliability when assessed with the VAS as
   well as with the numerical scale (Observer I: r(VAS) = 0.97 and r(Num) =
   0.77; Observer II: r(VAS) = 0.82 and r(Num) = 0.84 for the crush test).
   However, not all traits, and particularly including those assessing
   rarely occurring behaviour patterns, proved to be appropriate for
   recording with a VAS. In conclusion, a VAS that is based on carefully
   selected features can be considered a reliable and practical method for
   temperament assessment in cattle.}},

Title = {{Short- and long-term repeatability and pseudo-repeatability of bird
   song: sensitivity of signals to varying environments}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To provide reliable information about individual-specific
   characteristics, sexual signals should be consistently displayed within
   an individual at least within a particular social context or time
   window. However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme
   within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To
   investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific
   attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the
   repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes
   (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size
   showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all
   temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an
   individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent
   environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length,
   mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and
   within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25)
   that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental
   effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest
   boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than
   those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the
   characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are
   sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to
   the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic
   signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of
   information can be conveyed to the receivers.
   Significance statement
   We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared
   flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal
   contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that
   repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a
   decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was
   confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because
   individuals that changed residency between days sang with less
   consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that
   pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In
   general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the
   signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or
   environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals
   determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual
   quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers.}},

Abstract = {{Antipredator behaviours can be lost relatively quickly in populations
   that are relieved of predation, as is known for several species
   inhabiting islands. Flight initiation distance (FID) is often studied in
   the context of island tameness; however, little is known about the
   factors that influence and maintain FID variation in predation-free
   populations. Here, we studied FID in foals of an isolated predator-free
   population of feral horses (Equus caballus L., 1758) on Sable Island,
   Canada, to determine if FID could be used for research on consistent
   individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition
   to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared
   repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days).
   Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and
   females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex
   effects. In contrast, FID decreased for measurements made on subsequent
   days and from east to west, which could reflect habituation to human
   presence and (or) other temporal and spatial processes. Repeatability
   was high (0.42 +/- 0.06), but tended to decrease with increasing time
   intervals. This study highlights the potential of FID for
   individual-based research on the ecology and evolutionary dynamics of
   risk aversion in predation-free populations.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To assess possible intraday variability in Bruch's membrane
   opening-based (BMO) assessment of neuroretinal rim by spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the optic nerve head (ONH) as
   well as to evaluate its independence from intraindividual IOP changes.
   METHODS. In this noninterventional, prospective cohort study, 51
   consecutively enrolled patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension
   underwent standardized SD-OCT of the ONH and IOP assessment at two
   different time points with a time gap of 5 hours on the same day. Random
   effects models, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and
   Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze repeatability of BMO minimum rim
   width (BMO-MRW) and area (BMO-MRA) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber
   layer (RNFL) thickness measurements.
   RESULTS. Mean BMO area was 1.86 +/- 0.30 mm(2). At baseline, mean
   BMO-MRW was 206.46 +/- 0.86 mu m, mean BMO-MRA was 0.89 +/- 0.34 mm(2),
   and mean RNFL thickness was 71.61 +/- 0.20 mu m. Within intraindividual
   measurements, mean difference was 2.95 mu m or 1.76\% for BMO-MRW, 0.02
   mm 2 or 2.68\% for BMO-MRA, and 1.18 mu m or 1.89\% for RNFL thickness.
   Comparing time points, eta(2) was 0.001 (P = 0.757) for RNFL thickness,
   0.043 (P = 0.01) for BMO-MRA, and 0.07 (P = 0.06) for BMO-MRW.
   Intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.994,
   respectively. Variability of morphometric parameters did not correlate
   to intraindividual IOP fluctuations.
   CONCLUSIONS. Assessment of BMO-MRW by SD-OCT shows high intraday
   repeatability, which is comparable to the parameter RNFL thickness.
   Variability seems not to be driven by typical moderate intraday
   fluctuations of IOP The two-dimensional parameter BMO-MRA incorporates a
   fairly higher intraindividual variability.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has demonstrated that an individual's behavioural
   decisions can have a profound impact on an animal's fitness. For
   anadromous fishes requiring access to spawning habitat above
   obstructions, successful passage at fishways may at least in part be a
   function of an individual's behavioural type. The objectives of this
   study were to determine whether distinct behavioural typesbold and
   shycould be distinguished within a population of anadromous rainbow
   smelt (Osmerus mordax) and, if so, whether passage success at a
   nature-like fishway varied relative to behavioural type. Field-caught
   rainbow smelt were tested for individual differences in boldness (i.e.,
   willingness to engage in risk-taking behaviour) using the metrics of
   exploratory behaviour, general activity, and response to a simulated
   predator. After testing, 276 rainbow smelt were implanted with a passive
   integrated transponder tag, released below the fishway, and their
   movements monitored via a stationary antenna array. The results of our
   behavioural assays indicated the presence of a behavioural syndrome
   among rainbow smelt, and that behaviour was partially repeatable. In
   total, 41.7\% of fish entering the fishway passed successfully, but
   contrary to our initial prediction, boldness was not a significant
   predictor of successful passage. Instead, increasing water temperature
   and decreasing river discharge were consistent predictors of successful
   passage and greater distances moved through the fishway. Our findings
   indicate that the nature-like fishway did not select for a particular
   behavioural type and that individuals representing the spectrum of
   bold-shy behavioural types could pass.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses are shaped by a complex interplay of extrinsic

   four populations of zebrafish collected from widely varying habitat

   contexts: in a novel environment; in an environment with refuge and
   predators; in the presence of a shoal; and in the presence of a shoal
   and predators. The population from a high-flow and high-predation
   habitat was significantly bolder than populations from low-predation and
   low-flow/stagnant habitats. Individuals were significantly bolder in the
   presence of shoal and predators than in the other contexts. In general,
   males were significantly bolder than females. Smaller individuals took
   greater risks to feed than larger individuals only within two
   populations. The high-predation, high-flow habitat fish also showed
   significantly lower between- and within-individual variation in boldness

Abstract = {{Parasitism is a consequence of complex interactions between host,
   parasite, and their shared environment, and host behavior can influence
   parasite risk. Animal personality (i.e., consistent behavioral
   differences that are repeatable across time and context) can influence
   parasitism with more explorative individuals typically hosting greater
   parasite loads. Host sociality is known to impact parasite risk with
   more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or
   transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We
   quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including
   repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these
   personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We
   measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified
   ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2years at a site in
   southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration
   were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least
   chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality. More
   exploratory individuals hosted a greater abundance of ectoparasites
   compared to less exploratory individuals. Our results are consistent

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of consistent inter-individual differences in behavior
   ({''}animal personalities'') {[}1, 2] suggests that they might play a
   fundamental role in driving the movements and functioning of animal
   groups {[}3, 4], including their collective decision-making, foraging
   performance, and predator avoidance. Despite increasing evidence that
   highlights their importance {[}5-16], we still lack a unified
   mechanistic framework to explain and to predict how consistent
   inter-individual differences may drive collective behavior. Here we
   investigate how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and
   foraging performance of groups can emerge from inter-individual
   differences by high-resolution tracking of known behavioral types in
   free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) shoals. We show that
   individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a classic
   ``sociability'' assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a
   range of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership
   within groups as well as differences in structure and movement dynamics
   between groups. In turn, this trait, together with individual's
   exploratory tendency, measured by a classic ``boldness'' assay,
   explained individual and group foraging performance. These effects of
   consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged
   naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of
   individuals differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides
   experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain
   the emergence of collective behavior from consistent individual
   differences, including variation in the structure, leadership, movement
   dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups, across social and
   ecological scales. In addition, we demonstrate individual performance is
   conditional on group composition, indicating how social selection may
   drive behavioral differentiation between individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to introduce multilevel logistic regression analysis in

   logistic regression analysis (conditional probability, logit
   transformation, odds ratio). Second, we discuss the two fundamental
   implications of running this kind of analysis with a nested data
   structure: In multilevel logistic regression, the odds that the outcome
   variable equals one (rather than zero) may vary from one cluster to
   another (i.e. the intercept may vary) and the effect of a lower-level

Abstract = {{Research in rehabilitation engineering has shown that electrodes can
   produce tactile sensations with appropriate electrical signals to
   stimulate the multiple tactile receptors located under the fingertip
   skin. Numerous equivalent skin-electrode interfaces have been modeled to
   characterize the electrical properties of the skin; however, the values
   of these circuit models are continually changing, due both to the
   nonlinearity associated with human fingertip skin and to individual user
   differences. As a result, electrical stimulation that is suitable in
   terms of current or voltage level for tactile sensations cannot be
   guaranteed for every user. An identification method is then necessary
   for characterizing the parameters of the skin-electrode interface
   circuit model so as to improve rendering consistency and comfort for
   every user regardless of skin condition. In this paper, we introduce a
   custom-built electro-tactile display terminal, and then using this
   display terminal for data collection, we present an online
   identification scheme for determining the bio-impedance parameters of
   the well-known Cole-Cole circuit model for the skin-electrode interface.
   For this, a modified Kalman least squares iterative approach is used
   that relies on measuring only one-port square wave stimulation voltages.
   The repeatability and reliability of the identification scheme are
   tested by identifying the resistor-capacitor (RC) load bio-impedance
   networks of different users with both a dry and slightly damp index
   fingertip over multiple identification trials. Additionally, because of
   the inevitable variation in the parameters over multiple measurements,
   the repeatability of multiple calculated RC models (dry and wet) is
   further evaluated. The significance of our work is that it greatly
   improves the tactile rendering performance of electrical stimulation
   (electro-tactile) systems and will benefit the development of
   electro-tactile-based rehabilitative robotic devices and human-robot
   interfaces.}},

   The aim of the present study was to evaluate the inter-rater reliability
   of the Italian translation of the Structured Clinical Interview for
   DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) in a sample of clinical adult
   participants.
   Methods
   A sample of 104 in-and outpatients who were consecutively admitted to
   the Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy Unit of San Raffaele Turro
   Hospital, Milan, Italy, were administered the SCID-5-PD by trained
   graduate clinical psychologist using a pairwise interview design.
   Results
   In the present study, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values
   ranged from .88 (Dependent PD and Histrionic PD) to .94 (Avoidant PD)
   for dimensional SCID-5-PD interview dimensional ratings (median ICC
   value = .94). Adequate Cohen k values were observed for SCID-5-PD
   dichotomous ratings of presence of clinically significant subthreshold
   features (median kappa value = .78, SD = .06), as well as for SCID-5-PD
   interview categorical PD diagnoses (median kappa value = .89, SD = .11).
   Conclusions
   The present study findings suggest that the Italian translation of the

Abstract = {{Background: This study compares different lower-limb length measurements
   using tests of lower-limb upright full-length radiography and
   anteroposterior radiography of load-bearing hips.
   Methods: Forty-seven consecutive individuals aged 17 to 61 years (mean
   +/- SD, 31.47 +/- 11.42 years) voluntarily took part in the study; 23
   (48.9\%) were women and 24 (51.1\%) were men. All individuals presenting
   a difference of 5 mm or greater between both lower limbs quantified with
   a tape measure were included. All of the participants signed an informed
   consent form to take part in the study. Two anteroposterior load-bearing
   radiographs were taken: one of the hip and an upright full-length
   radiograph of the lower limbs. Lower-limb-length discrepancy was
   quantified by taking different reference points. Interobserver and
   intraobserver reliability was assessed for each radiographic
   measurement. Any correlation between the different measurements were
   also verified.
   Results: Interobserver and intraobserver reliability was high for all of
   the measurements because the intraclass correlation was greater than
   0.75 in all of the cases. There was a strong and positive correlation
   between the different measurements because when performing bivariate
   correlations with the Pearson correlation coefficient, positive values
   close to 1 were found.
   Conclusions: In this study, the different reference points reported in
   the upright fulllength radiograph in addition to the hip radiographs are
   useful for assessing lower-limblength discrepancy. The results showed
   that there is a correct correlation between the different measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The recording of slow pupillary oscillations in complete
   darkness is a promising approach for objective evaluation of daytime
   sleepiness at the physiological level. The aim of the present study was
   to analyze the magnitude of between-and within-subject variation of the
   pupillary unrest index (PUI) in a sample of healthy individuals.
   Materials and methods. The present data were collected within the
   framework of a mobile phone study on possible effects of radiofrequency
   electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on the central nervous system. Pupillary
   behavior was monitored in 30 young healthy male volunteers (age 18-30
   years) on ten non-consecutive experimental days at 11: 00 a.m. and 04:00
   p.m., using infrared video pupillography (compact integrated
   pupillograph, CIP). Since RF-EMF had no impact on the PUI, data were
   pooled for the present analysis.
   Results. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed that the PUI
   was subject to higher interindividual variation as compared to
   intraindividual variation at both times of measurement. This resulted in
   intraclass correlation coefficients pointing to a substantial stability
   of these interindividual differences. A comparison of the PUI results
   with currently used cutoff values revealed that more than 50\% of
   recordings from young, healthy, non-sleep-disturbed males showed values
   beyond the ``normal{''} range.
   Conclusion. The significant interindividual variability implies that the
   PUI is not only a state marker. Evaluations of such measurements should
   therefore consider the PUI as a possible trait marker to ensure
   comparability and correct interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater fish may be exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   because of several actions, including anesthesia and high levels of
   aquatic respiration and potentially as the result of using high-CO2
   plumes as a barrier to the movements of invasive fishes. Metabolic
   phenotype can potentially drive how freshwater fish respond to high CO2.
   We therefore quantified how tolerance (measured using time to
   equilibrium loss {[}ELT]) was driven by metabolic phenotype in a
   cosmopolitan freshwater fish species, Micropterus salmoides. ELT was
   repeatable, with 60\% of the variance across trials attributable to
   individual differences. For each fish, standard metabolic rate and
   maximum metabolic rate were measured using respirometers and time to
   exhaustion after a chase test was recorded. Fish with high anaerobic
   performance were less tolerant to elevated CO2, potentially as a result
   of preexisting metabolic acidosis. Standard metabolic rate and aerobic
   scope did not predict ELT. Our findings define which fish may be more
   vulnerable to high CO2, a potential mechanism for this tolerance, and
   show that tolerance to high CO2 may be acted on by natural selection.
   Should freshwater ecosystems become elevated in CO2, by either natural
   means or anthropogenic means, it is possible that there is potential for
   heritable selection of CO2 tolerance, evidenced by the fact that ELT was
   found to be repeatable.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural assessments of shelter dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)
   typically comprise standardized test batteries conducted at one time

   Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled
   longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the
   framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into
   personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity
   (i.e. inter-individual differences in average behaviour) and
   predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intraindividual
   variation). We analysed data on interactions of 3263 dogs (n=19 281)

   trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the
   analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity
   only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar
   people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages
   were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual
   level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic
   variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were

Abstract = {{An animal's life history, physiology, and behaviour can be shaped by
   selection in a manner that favours strong associations among these
   aspects of an integrated phenotype. Recent work combining animal
   personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster
   life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive
   rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels
   relative to those with slower life history strategies, but empirical
   tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter
   snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history
   strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick
   rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a
   measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly
   positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials.
   Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence
   of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of
   activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors,
   such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select
   for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to
   facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges. Thus, we offer
   evidence that behaviour is an important component of co-evolved suites
   of traits forming a general pace -of-life continuum in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic expressions of insects are strongly dependent on various
   external and internal factors, like diet or density and age or sex.
   However, environmental effects on the behavioural phenotype and
   repeatability are rather unexplored for holometabolous insects in their
   larval stage. We examined the effects of the food environment (young
   versus old cabbage leaves) and previous test experience on growth and
   behaviour of Phaedon cochleariae larvae. A more nutritious diet, i.e.,
   young leaves, had beneficial consequences on larval growth. Contrary to
   findings on adults, the behaviour of larvae was neither consistent over
   time nor across contexts, thus larvae did not show personality.
   Furthermore, larval behaviour was shaped independent of the diet,
   pointing to a stage-dependent receptivity towards diet conditions in
   this species. Besides, larval activity was significantly influenced by
   former test experience, with naive larvae being more active than
   previously tested larvae. In general, in insects memories in an
   olfactory or sexual behaviour context can lead to behavioural responses
   later in life. Mechanisms of memory-learning should be further explored
   in different contexts in insects. Overall, the present study reveals
   that growth-related traits are diet-dependent and that the activity of a

Abstract = {{Work on the repeatability of reproductive behaviour has mainly focused

   examined the consistency of individual male reproductive behaviour

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection has consequences for an animal's fitness, especially
   for sit-and-wait predators with limited mobility, and which cannot
   always correct earlier suboptimal choices. Environmental change may
   nevertheless lead individuals to relocate to another site, although such
   relocations can be energetically costly or risky. Temperature and
   illumination are two important factors that undergo change in seasonal
   and daily cycles that may impact habitat quality. Animals must therefore
   either acclimate to the new conditions or relocate. Wormlions are
   sit-and-wait, trap-building predators whose success in foraging is
   highly dependent on their surroundings. Here, we manipulated temperature
   (high, low, and moderate) and let the wormlions choose between lit and
   shaded conditions. We found that the typical wormlion preference for
   shaded microhabitats decreased with increasing temperature. We then
   followed wormlion behavior under a fullfactorial design of two constant
   illumination conditions (light vs. shade) and three temperatures.
   Although both constant light and high temperature reduced foraging
   performance, expressed in pit construction tendency and pit area, the
   two conditions had a non-additive effect. Acclimation to extreme thermal
   conditions moderated the negative effects of such temperatures,
   expressed in a higher tendency to construct a pit, and equalized
   performance across temperatures. Finally, the high temperature reduced
   behavioral consistency while acclimation increased it, suggesting that
   consistency is impaired by unfavorable environmental change. To
   conclude, while an environmental change usually affects several
   environmental factors simultaneously, the induced behavioral change is
   neither synergic nor additive and can even differ from the response to
   each unfavorable environmental factor in isolation.
   Significance statement
   Choosing a suitable habitat is essential for survival and reproduction,
   especially for sedentary organisms, and requires the consideration of
   various environmental conditions. Acclimating to suboptimal conditions,
   however, might conduce to improving performance in a less suitable
   habitat. Testing the effect of several environmental conditions on
   habitat choice and foraging behavior, before and after acclimation, has
   rarely been carried out. Here, we tested the combined effects of
   temperature, illumination, and their interaction, on habitat choice and
   foraging performance of a sit-and-wait predator, the wormlion. Wormlions
   usually prefer shade, but their preference for light increases with
   decreasing temperature. Both temperature and illumination affect
   behavior but their joint effect is not additive. Acclimation, which took
   place for temperature but not for illumination, improved certain
   foraging behaviors. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating
   several environmental conditions and behaviors when studying habitat
   choice and foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of animal
   personality. Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between
   behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for
   behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny.
   The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and
   behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However,
   the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare.
   Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and
   juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures
   than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound
   changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In
   this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the
   desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate
   behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life
   stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature
   females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater
   aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their
   environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory
   cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations
   do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between
   aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature
   males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable
   across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that
   behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our
   results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait
   values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with
   developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation,
   albeit at different time points in males and females. This period of the
   life cycle merits systematic examination across taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have evaluated whether habitat disturbance affects
   behavioral consistency and plasticity. We measured shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance for the first time in naked-footed mice
   (Peromyscus nudipes) in two adjacent habitats with differing level of
   disturbance in Costa Rica. Each habitat was measured in different,
   consecutive years. With these data, we explored the possibility of
   habitat differences in individual- and population-level behavioral
   plasticity, magnitude of behavior, and consistency. Mice in both
   habitats behaved consistently across time with high repeatability (i.e.,
   showed personality). The strength of consistency of shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance over time was higher in the disturbed habitat, and
   individuals in the undisturbed habitat were bolder and less exploratory.
   Behaviors were correlated with each other in both habitats, indicating
   that behavioral syndromes do not always break down in disturbed areas.
   Mice changed the magnitude of their response the second time they were
   tested, indicating population-level plasticity. There was also greater
   individual plasticity among mice in the undisturbed habitat. Our study
   suggests the possibility that habitat disturbance can affect behavioral
   plasticity and personality and that shyer/more exploratory individuals
   might colonize and/or persist in disturbed habitats. These results are
   preliminary and exploratory because we did not control for temporal
   differences between habitats.}},

Abstract = {{1. The variations in migration that comprise partial diel migrations,
   putatively occur entirely as a consequence of behavioural flexibility.
   However, seasonal partial migrations are increasingly recognised to be
   mediated by a combination of reversible plasticity in response to
   environmental variation and individual variation due to genetic and
   environmental effects.
   2. Here, we test the hypothesis that while partial diel migration
   heterogeneity occurs primarily due to short-term within-individual
   flexibility in behaviour, long-term individual differences in migratory
   behaviour also underpin this migration variation.
   3. Specifically, we use a hierarchical behavioural reaction norm
   approach to partition within- and among-individual variation in depth
   use and diel plasticity in depth use, across short- and long-term
   time-scales, in a group of 47 burbot (Lota lota) tagged with
   depth-sensing acoustic telemetry transmitters.
   4. We found that within- individual variation at the
   among-dates-within-seasons and among-seasons scale, explained the
   dominant proportion of phenotypic variation. However, individuals also
   repeatedly differed in their expression of migration behaviour over the
   2 year study duration.
   5. These results reveal that diel migration variation occurs primarily
   due to short- term within-individual flexibility in depth use and diel
   migration behaviour. However, repeatable individual differences also
   played a key role in mediating partial diel migration.
   6. These findings represent a significant advancement of our
   understanding of the mechanisms generating the important, yet poorly
   understood phenomena of partial diel migration. Moreover, given the
   pervasive occurrence of diel migrations across aquatic taxa, these
   findings indicate that individual differences have an important, yet
   previously unacknowledged role in structuring the temporal and vertical
   dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.}},

   local independence and measurement invariance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or
   ``latent{''} personality traits that explain broad patterns of
   behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g.,
   factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but
   infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal
   personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e.,
   uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect
   (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with
   behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of
   individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using
   observations of aggression in four age classes (4-10 months, 10 months-3
   years, 3-6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N =
   4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported
   the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits
   underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and
   aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; TuckerLewis
   index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression
   across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).
   However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but
   not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by
   latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards
   people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus,
   sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple
   functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the
   robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically
   assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors
   influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because
   inaccurate ``aggressive personality{''} trait attributions can be costly
   to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.}},

Abstract = {{Despite accumulating evidence for individual variation in behavioural

   simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of
   zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and
   food availability that were repeated in discrete `bursts' of sampling
   through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more
   responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained

   (R-slope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment

Abstract = {{Males often express traits that improve competitive ability, such as
   aggressiveness. Females also express such traits but our understanding
   about why is limited. Intraspecific aggression between females might be
   used to gain access to reproductive resources but simultaneously incurs
   costs in terms of energy and time available for reproductive activities,
   resulting in a trade-off. Although consistent individual differences in
   female behaviour (i.e. personality) like aggressiveness are likely to
   influence these reproductive trade-offs, little is known about the
   consistency of aggressiveness in females. To quantify aggression we
   presented a female decoy to free-living female great tits (Parus major)
   during the egg-laying period, and assessed whether they were consistent
   in their response towards this decoy. Moreover, we assessed whether
   female aggression related to consistent individual differences in
   exploration behaviour in a novel environment. We found that females
   consistently differed in aggressiveness, although first-year females
   were on average more aggressive than older females. Moreover, conform
   life history theory predictions, `fast' exploring females were more
   aggressive towards the decoy than `slow' exploring females. Given that
   personality traits are often heritable, and correlations between
   behaviours can constrain short term adaptive evolution, our findings

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Extracellular volume fraction (ECV) is altered in
   pathological cardiac remodeling and predicts death and arrhythmia. ECV
   can be quantified using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1
   mapping but calculation requires a measured hematocrit (Hct). The
   longitudinal relaxation of blood has been used in adults to generate a
   synthetic Hct (estimate of true Hct) but has not been validated in
   pediatric populations.
   Methods: One hundred fourteen children and young adults underwent a
   total of 163 CMRs with T1 mapping. The majority of subjects had a
   measured Hct the same day (N = 146). Native and post-contrast T1 were
   determined in blood pool, septum, and free wall of mid-LV, avoiding
   areas of late gadolinium enhancement. Synthetic Hct and ECV were
   calculated and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and linear
   regression were used to compare measured and synthetic values.
   Results: The mean age was 16.4 +/- 6.4 years and mean left ventricular
   ejection fraction was 59\% +/- 9\%. The mean measured Hct was 41.8 +/-
   3.0\% compared to the mean synthetic Hct of 43.2\% +/- 2.9\% (p < 0.001,
   ICC 0.46 {[}0.27, 0.52]) with the previously published model and 41.8\%
   +/- 1.4\% (p < 0.001, ICC 0.28 {[}0.13, 0. 42]) with the locally-derived
   model. Mean measured mid-free wall ECV was 30.5\% +/- 4.8\% and mean
   synthetic mid-free wall ECV of local model was 29. 7\% +/- 4.6\% (p <
   0.001, ICC 0.93 {[}0.91, 0.95]). Correlations were not affected by heart
   rate and did not significantly differ in subpopulation analysis. While
   the ICC was strong, differences between measured and synthetic ECV
   ranged from -8.4\% to 4.3\% in the septum and -12.6\% to 15.8\% in the
   free wall. Using our laboratory's normal cut-off of 28.5\%, 59 patients
   (37\%) were miscategorized (53 false negatives, 6 false positives) with
   published model ECV. The local model had 37 miscategorizations (20 false
   negatives, 17 false positives), significantly fewer but still a
   substantial number (23\%).
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that use of synthetic Hct for the
   calculation of ECV results in miscategorization of individual patients.
   This difference may be less significant once synthetic ECV is calculated
   and averaged over a large research cohort, making it potentially useful
   as a research tool. However, we recommend formal measurement of Hct in
   children and young adults for clinical CMRs.}},

Pages = {{60-66}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To increase the populations of the Norwegian horse breeds, it is
   desirable to improve their competitive edge in the market. One of the
   declared strengths of these populations are their robust temperament,
   which has not been described sufficiently to be utilized for breeding
   purposes. A horse personality questionnaire (HPQ), with grading of 43
   behaviourally defined adjectives, was analysed with a factor analysis to
   condense the temperament of the four Norwegian breeds into main
   temperamental factors. The analysis consisted of 1018 horses and the
   respondents was in general handlers or owners of the objective horse.
   The Fjord horse, the Dole horse and the Nordland/Lyngen shared the same
   five factors in the analysis; `anxiousness', `agreeableness',
   `conscientiousness', `openness' and `dominance'. The Norwegian
   coldblooded trotter shared the same five factors, but in addition had a
   factor identified as `excitability'. In total, the factors explained a
   maximum of 44\% of the variance, which is somewhat less than other
   studies using the HPQ or similar. An expansion of number of adjectives
   compared to earlier studies, with skewness in which factor they load on
   to and more non-loading adjectives, could be an explanation of this. The
   use of HPQ has contributed to simplify the phenotypic landscape, but for
   future development of assessing temperamental traits for breeding
   purposes, a horse personality questionnaire is not recommended, as it is
   probably highly influenced by personal preferences or possible benefits
   of the owner. The alternative is impartial observers unknown to the
   horses, demanding a test arena for the horses, where the observers can
   base their ratings on the horses' performances.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral characteristics importantly shape an animals' ability to
   adapt to changing conditions. The notion that behavioral flexibility
   facilitates exploitation of urban environments has received mixed
   support, but recent studies propose that between-individual differences
   are important. We leverage existing knowledge on three species of
   orb-web spider (Araneidae, Araneae) whose abundances differ along an
   urban-rural gradient to test predictions about between-and
   within-species/individual behavioral variation. We sampled Larinioides
   sclopetarius from their urban environment, and two species from suburban
   environments, Zygiella x-notata and Nuctenea umbratica. For each
   species, we quantified activity in a novel environment and
   within-species aggression. We analyzed between-and within-individual
   variation in behavior as well as their repeatability and correlations.
   As predicted, L. sclopetarius exhibited the highest activity in a novel
   environment and N. umbratica the lowest. Across all species, males were
   more aggressive than females and Z. x-notata was the most aggressive,
   followed by L. sclopetarius and N. umbratica. For all species,
   between-individual differences in activity and aggressiveness were
   repeatable; but the two behaviors were not correlated for any species.
   We next tested how group composition in relation to aggressiveness
   affects survival in high density conditions. Groups of Z. x-notata
   consisting of aggressive and tolerant spiders had higher survival rates
   than groups composed of only aggressive or tolerant individuals.
   Ultimately, we uncovered a complex pattern of behavioral variation
   between species as well as between and within individuals and we discuss
   the relative roles of this variation with respect to adapting to urban
   environments.
   Significance statement
   Urbanization has drastically changed biodiversity patterns. While the
   majority of species cope poorly with urban habitats, some species
   flourish in cities. Our understanding of behavioral characteristics that
   facilitate this exploitation, however, remains poor. We explored between
   and within species and individual variation in behaviors in ecologically
   similar orb-weaving spider species whose abundances differ along the
   urban-rural gradient. We detect both consistent individual differences
   and plasticity, in individuals' response to a novel environment,
   suggesting that some degree of flexibility in reaction to novelty may be
   crucial in an urbanized environment. We also found that variation in
   aggressiveness type enables survival in high density conditions,
   conditions typical for urban populations. Urban populations thus exhibit
   a complex pattern of behavioral flexibility and behavioral stability.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in quantifying consistent among-individual variation in primate
   behavior, also known as personality, has grown rapidly in recent
   decades. Although behavioral coding is the most frequently utilized
   method for assessing primate personality, limitations in current
   statistical practice prevent researchers' from utilizing the full
   potential of their coding datasets. These limitations include the use of
   extensive data aggregation, not modeling biologically relevant sources
   of individual variance during repeatability estimation, not partitioning
   between-individual (co)variance prior to modeling personality structure,
   the misuse of principal component analysis, and an over-reliance upon
   exploratory statistical techniques to compare personality models across
   populations, species, and data collection methods. In this paper, we
   propose a statistical framework for primate personality research
   designed to address these limitations. Our framework synthesizes
   recently developed mixed-effects modeling approaches for quantifying
   behavioral variation with an information-theoretic model selection
   paradigm for confirmatory personality research. After detailing a
   multi-step analytic procedure for personality assessment and model
   comparison, we employ this framework to evaluate seven models of
   personality structure in zoo-housed bonobos (Pan paniscus). We find that
   differences between sexes, ages, zoos, time of observation, and social
   group composition contributed to significant behavioral variance.
   Independently of these factors, however, personality nonetheless
   accounted for a moderate to high proportion of variance in average
   behavior across observational periods. A personality structure derived
   from past rating research receives the strongest support relative to our
   model set. This model suggests that personality variation across the
   measured behavioral traits is best described by two correlated but
   distinct dimensions reflecting individual differences in affiliation and
   sociability (Agreeableness) as well as activity level, social play, and
   neophilia toward non-threatening stimuli (Openness). These results
   underscore the utility of our framework for quantifying personality in
   primates and facilitating greater integration between the behavioral
   ecological and comparative psychological approaches to personality
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of cooperative behaviour are typically confined

   major helping behaviours performed by subordinates of the cooperatively
   breeding fish Neolamprologus pulcher. To experimentally manipulate the
   amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two
   environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping
   behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low
   heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were
   predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The
   perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social
   interactions significantly influenced helping propensities. Our results
   reveal that developmentally plastic adjustments of provided help to
   social context shape cooperative phenotypes, whereas heritable genetic
   variation plays a minor role.}},

Abstract = {{Hormonal pleiotropy the simultaneous influence of a single hormone on
   multiple traits has been hypothesized as an important mechanism
   underlying personality, and circulating glucocorticoids are central to
   this idea. A major gap in our understanding is the neural basis for this
   link. Here we examine the stability and structure of behavioral,
   endocrine and neuroendocrine traits in a population of songbirds (Parus
   major). Upon identifying stable and covarying behavioral and endocrine
   traits, we test the hypothesis that risk-averse personalities exhibit a
   neuroendocrine stress axis that is systemically potentiated
   characterized by stronger glucocorticoid reactivity and weaker negative
   feedback. We show high among-individual variation and covariation (i.e.
   personality) in risk-taking behaviors and demonstrate that four aspects
   of glucocorticoid physiology (baseline, stress response, negative
   feedback strength and adrenal sensitivity) are also repeatable and
   covary. Further, we establish that high expression of mineralocorticoid
   and low expression of glucocorticoid receptor in the brain are linked
   with systemically elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels and more
   risk-averse personalities. Our findings support the hypothesis that
   steroid hormones can exert pleiotropic effects that organize behavioral

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the ability of transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) outcomes in the chronic stroke population to (i) track
   individual plastic changes and (ii) detect differences between
   individuals. To this end, intrarater ``test-retest{''} reliability
   (relative and absolute) was tested for the ipsilesional and
   contralesional hemispheres.
   Methods: Thirteen participants with a unilateral stroke (>= 6 months
   ago) and sensorimotor impairments were enrolled. Single and paired-pulse
   TMS outcomes were obtained from the primary motor cortex (M1)
   representation of the tibialis anterior muscle in both hemispheres and
   at two sessions separated by one week. The standard error of the
   measurement (SEMeas), minimal detectable change (MDC) and intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) were studied.
   Results: Active motor threshold and latency of motor evoked potentials
   provided the lowest SEMeas and highest ICCs for both ipsi- and
   contralesional hemispheres. However, MDC were generally large, thus
   questioning the use of TMS outcomes to track individual plastic changes
   of M1.
   Conclusions: Our study provided supporting evidence of good to excellent
   intrarater reliability for a few TMS outcomes and proposed
   recommendations on the interpretation and the use of that knowledge in

   analysis to disentangle the role played by genetics and learning in tool
   use in an insular population of a long- lived vulture, Neophron

   perhaps because of the low variability observed among birds. However,
   not all individuals used stones to break eggs, and those that did so
   behaved consistently. Importantly, there was no evidence of learning at

Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{161-170}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in
   repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly
   understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of
   adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable
   differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in
   repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body
   size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on
   personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual
   variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive
   colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1)
   test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal
   personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and
   boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes
   (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3)
   determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at
   the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation
   along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations
   did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural
   syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance
   in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility
   and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations
   indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P.
   corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable
   between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test
   this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent

Abstract = {{Nuptial gifts are under strong selection in terms of female choice. It
   is hypothesized that nuptial gifts represent an honest signal resulting
   from the trade-off between self-maintenance and mating effort.
   Furthermore, nuptial gift size may correlate with certain personality
   traits, such as male fighting or hunting abilities. We investigated the
   nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of
   both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their
   relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and
   personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's
   weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing
   support for the honest signalling hypothesis. No differences in body
   condition and fluctuating asymmetry between males carrying and not
   carrying gifts in the field were found which does not support the honest
   signalling hypothesis. A substantial proportion of males offered
   worthless gifts that were smaller and lighter than genuine gifts.
   Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no
   behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial
   gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed.
   These results suggest that male size serves as an honest indicator of

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{1. An individual's foraging behaviour and time allocated to feeding have
   direct consequences for its fitness. Despite much research on
   population-level foraging decisions, few studies have investigated
   individual differences in fine-scale daily foraging patterns among wild
   animals.
   2. Here, we explore the consistency and plasticity of feeding tactics of
   individual great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus),
   using a grid of 65 automated feeding stations in a 385-ha woodland,
   during three winters. We use a principal component analysis to describe
   individual variation in six feeding parameters and examine how these
   differences covary with dominance-linked attributes (species, age and
   sex), the personality trait `exploration behaviour', distance to
   territory and local competition intensity.
   3. Analysis of 933 086 feeder visits by 3134 individuals revealed that
   the majority of variation in the timing of feeding was explained by two
   principal components. PC1 ('binge-eating'), accounting for 38\% of
   variation, captured temporal clustering of feeding, with high
   repeatability both within and between years (r range: 0.42-0.55). PC2
   ('transience'), accounting for 27\% of variance, described how much
   individuals used feeders and was also repeatable (r: 0.34-0.62). While
   exhibiting consistent individual differences, birds also showed
   flexibility in foraging patterns, binge-eating less and using feeders
   more when they experienced greater local competition.
   4. Individuals in behaviourally dominant states (great tits, males and
   adults) binged more than subordinate birds (blue tits, females and
   juveniles) when their territories were distant from feeding stations.
   Moreover, great tits and males used feeders more than blue tits and
   females respectively, while birds feeding further from their territory
   used feeders less than those feeding closer. `Exploration behaviour' was
   unrelated to both measures of daily foraging behaviour.
   5. This study presents some of the first evidence that birds use
   consistent alternative foraging tactics at a fine temporal scale.
   Individuals are consistent in their tactics, and also adjust their
   foraging behaviour with changes in local competition. Hence, studies of
   foraging behaviour should consider the extent to which such
   individual-level variability in foraging behaviour is under selection.}},

Abstract = {{1. The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis is an extended concept of
   the life-history theory that includes behavioural traits. The studies
   challenging the POLS hypothesis often focus on the relationships between
   a single personality trait and a physiological and/or life-history
   trait. While pathogens represent a major selective pressure, few studies
   have been interested in testing relationships between behavioural
   syndrome, and several fitness components including immunity.
   2. The aim of this study was to address this question in the mealworm
   beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a model species in immunity studies. The
   personality score was estimated from a multidimensional syndrome based
   of four repeatable behavioural traits.
   3. In a first experiment, we investigated its relationship with two
   measures of fitness (reproduction and survival) and three components of
   the innate immunity (haemocyte concentration, and levels of activity of
   the phenoloxidase including the total proenzyme and the naturally
   activated one) to challenge the POLS hypothesis in T. molitor. Overall,
   we found a relationship between behavioural syndrome and reproductive
   success in this species, thus supporting the POLS hypothesis. We also
   showed a sex-specific relationship between behavioural syndrome and
   basal immune parameters.
   4. In a second experiment, we tested whether this observed relationship
   with innate immunity could be confirmed in term of differential survival
   after challenging by entomopathogenic bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis.
   In this case, no significant relationship was evidenced.
   5. We recommend that future researchers on the POLS should control for
   differences in evolutionary trajectory between sexes and to pay
   attention to the choice of the proxy used, especially when looking at
   immune traits.}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{917-930}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies into community level dynamics are revealing processes and
   patterns that underpin the biodiversity and complexity of natural
   ecosystems. Theoretical food webs have suggested that species-rich and
   highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating
   certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric
   body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been
   shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence.
   Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web
   theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing
   knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or
   personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research.
   Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between
   individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological
   contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ
   between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the
   framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual
   consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is
   likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait
   variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics
   of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of
   temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity
   for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new
   insights into community stability and biodiversity.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{144-149}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural research traditionally focusses on the mean responses of a
   group of individuals rather than variation in behaviour around the mean
   or among individuals. However, examining the variation in behaviour
   among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the
   evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most
   commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural
   research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations
   that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual
   variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of
   within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be
   important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of
   conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of
   the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this
   experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island
   robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and
   examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk),
   (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant
   relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found
   that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV
   in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness
   and IN in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of
   repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant
   differences in IIV among different individuals within the population.
   Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IW in their
   boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces
   behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results
   definitively demonstrate that IN itself varies across individuals and is
   linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of
   future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for
   behavioural interactions.}},

Title = {{Temnothorax rugatulus ant colonies consistently vary in nest structure
   across time and context}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{A host of animals build architectural constructions. Such constructions
   frequently vary with environmental and individual/colony conditions, and
   their architecture directly influences behavior and fitness. The nests
   of ant colonies drive and enable many of their collective behaviors, and
   as such are part of their `extended phenotype'. Since ant colonies have
   been recently shown to differ in behavior and life history strategy, we
   ask whether colonies differ in another trait: the architecture of the
   constructions they create. We allowed Temnothorax rugatulus rock ants,
   who create nests by building walls within narrow rock gaps, to
   repeatedly build nest walls in a fixed crevice but under two
   environmental conditions. We find that colonies consistently differ in
   their architecture across environments and over nest building events.
   Colony identity explained 12-40\% of the variation in nest architecture,
   while colony properties and environmental conditions explained 5-20\%,
   as indicated by the condition and marginal R-2 values. When their nest
   boxes were covered, which produced higher humidity and lower airflow,
   colonies built thicker, longer, and heavier walls. Colonies also built
   more robust walls when they had more brood, suggesting a protective
   function of wall thickness. This is, to our knowledge, the first study
   to explicitly investigate the repeatability of nestbuilding behavior in
   a controlled environment. Our results suggest that colonies may face
   tradeoffs, perhaps between factors such as active vs. passive nest
   defense, and that selection may act on individual construction rules as
   a mechanisms to mediate colony-level behavior.}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine if the large and highly reproducible
   interindividual differences in arousal intensity and heart rate response
   to arousal (Delta HR) during non-REM sleep are heritable.
   Methods: Polysomnograms of 55 monozygotic (14 male and 41 female pairs)
   and 36 dizygotic (15 male and 21 female pairs) same-sex twin pairs were
   analyzed. Arousals were scored using the 2012 American Academy of Sleep
   Medicine criteria. Arousal intensity was scaled (between 0 and 9) using
   an automatic algorithm based on the change in electroencephalogram time
   and frequency characteristics. The Delta HR was determined at each
   arousal. We calculated average arousal duration, average arousal
   intensity, average overall Delta HR, average Delta HR at a given arousal
   intensity, slope of Delta HR per arousal intensity, and arousal
   intensity threshold of Delta HR.
   Results: The intraclass correlations among monozygotic and dizygotic
   twin pairs were 0.663 and 0.146, respectively, for average arousal
   intensity, and 0.449 and 0, respectively, for arousal intensity
   threshold of.HR controlling for age, sex, and race. These values imply
   large broad sense heritability (H-2) for these traits. This evidence was
   confirmed by a robust maximum likelihood-based variance components
   estimation approach, with an additive genetic heritability of 0.64 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.80) for average arousal intensity and a
   combined additive and dominance genetic heritability and of 0.46 (0.25
   to 0.68) for arousal intensity threshold of Delta HR. Results also
   suggested significant additive genetic effects for average arousal
   duration, Delta HR at arousal intensity scale 4 and the overall average
   Delta HR.
   Conclusion: Genetic factors explain a significant fraction of the
   phenotypic variability for average arousal intensity and arousal
   intensity threshold of Delta HR. Results suggest that the duration of
   arousals and specific average Delta HR values may also be heritable
   traits.}},

Title = {{Boldness: are open field and startle tests measuring the same
   personality trait?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Boldness, the willingness of individuals to engage in risky behaviour,
   is one of the most studied personality traits. It has been measured
   using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different
   assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted
   to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced
   mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under
   standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation.
   Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African
   striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open
   field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from
   startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of
   risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle
   tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During
   open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the
   wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature).
   During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a
   protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions)
   after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking
   behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were
   repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across
   contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of
   risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures,
   supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different
   personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two
   assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in
   the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle
   test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{The goal of the current study was to assess the interrater reliability
   of the Psychopathy ChecklistRevised (PCL-R) among a large sample of
   trained raters (N = 280). All raters completed PCL-R training at some
   point between 1989 and 2012 and subsequently provided complete coding
   for the same 6 practice cases. Overall, 3 major conclusions can be drawn
   from the results: (a) reliability of individual PCL-R items largely fell
   below any appropriate standards while the estimates for Total PCL-R
   scores and factor scores were good (but not excellent); (b) the cases
   representing individuals with high psychopathy scores showed better
   reliability than did the cases of individuals in the moderate to low
   PCL-R score range; and (c) there was a high degree of variability among
   raters; however, rater specific differences had no consistent effect on
   scoring the PCL-R. Therefore, despite low reliability estimates for
   individual items, Total scores and factor scores can be reliably scored
   among trained raters. We temper these conclusions by noting that scoring
   standardized videotaped case studies does not allow the rater to
   interact directly with the offender. Real-world PCL-R assessments
   typically involve a face-to-face interview and much more extensive
   collateral information. We offer recommendations for new web-based

Abstract = {{In near-infrared non-invasive blood glucose measurement, the signal
   variation caused by glucose is very weak, vulnerable to human
   involvement, measuring instruments and environmental changes, limiting
   the accuracy of non-invasive blood glucose sensing. To address this
   issue, the group applies the theory of floating reference position to
   eliminate background interference. However, due to the individual
   differences and the complexity of human environment, the floating
   reference positions will vary from person to person. Based on the Monte
   Carlo simulation of three layer skin model of human palm, the floating
   reference positions of 1 000 similar to 1 700 nm near infrared band were
   found in the vicinity of 2 mm of the radial distance from the light
   source. So in order to improve the applicability of the floating
   reference methods in different persons, this paper presents a near
   floating reference measuring(N-FRM) method. The radial distance 2 mm was
   chosen as the reference position for background interference's
   correction, then the effect by phantom experiments is validated.
   Furthermore select the phantom Intralipid solution with 2\% and 3\%
   concentration for experiments, whose floating reference positions are
   close to the skin model of human palm. The results showed that the N-FRM
   method could reduce the influence of light source drift, improve the
   repeatability and stability of data. Based on multiple diffuse
   reflection signal acquisition of 2\% and 3\% intralipid solutions with
   different glucose content and the glucose concentration prediction
   models, and it was found that the regression models root mean square
   errors of prediction were reduced by 38. 51\%-79. 98\% and 29. 72\%-52.
   22\%. The comparison showed that this method could effectively eliminate
   the common background changes at two measured positions, improve the
   prediction accuracy of the calibration models. The results of phantom
   experiments provide a strong support for the application of N-FRM's in
   vivo measurement.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Many behavioural traits show important inter-individual phenotypic and
   genetic variation despite strong potential selection that should reduce
   this variability. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental
   conditions has been proposed to maintain such variation but empirical
   evidences supporting this hypothesis are still scarce for behavioural
   traits. Here, we analysed the repeatability and the ecological and
   individual factors that influence the expression of docility across
   different environmental contexts in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias
   striatus) studied over a period of 10 years. We also estimated the
   heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting
   on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately
   repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age,
   was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and
   decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at
   0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only,
   individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival.
   Our study confirms that docility is both phenotypically and genetically
   variables and that disruptive selection might maintain the variability
   in this trait.
   Significance statement
   Documenting the factors allowing the maintenance of phenotypic and
   genetic variation of behavioural traits within natural populations is a
   central objective in ecology and evolution. Here, we studied a wild
   eastern chipmunk population over 10 years and recorded docility, a
   personality trait, on both juveniles and adults. We showed that docility
   was repeatable and that it was also heritable and influenced by
   different individual and environmental factors. Importantly, we also
   found that disruptive viability selection was acting on adult docility
   independently of environmental variations. Our results show that
   docility is both phenotypically and genetically variable and that
   patterns of selection acting on this trait can maintain personality
   heterogeneity across temporally varying environmental conditions in the
   wild.}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate
   causation and ecological and evolutionary significance in particular,
   but the question of its development was largely overlooked. The
   attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences
   in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency)
   and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by
   development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables
   measured in various tests with different contexts over several
   life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the
   Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and
   some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values
   are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality
   axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the
   other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the
   feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic
   behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar
   personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of
   behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results
   require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures
   resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied
   the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural
   characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress
   response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the
   agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the
   juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and
   the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it
   is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the
   structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour
   is differentially consistent, the structure can change.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural individuality is thought to be caused by differences in

   genetically identical individuals, direct social interactions are
   predicted to be a powerful factor shaping the development of
   individuality. We use tightly controlled ontogenetic experiments with
   clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), to test whether
   near-identical rearing conditions and lack of social contact dampen
   individuality. In sharp contrast to our predictions, we find that (i)
   substantial individual variation in behaviour emerges among genetically
   identical individuals isolated directly after birth into highly
   standardized environments and (ii) increasing levels of social
   experience during ontogeny do not affect levels of individual

Abstract = {{Hormones can facilitate the expression of behavior, but relatively few
   studies have considered individual variation and repeatability in
   hormone-behavior relationships. Repeated measures of hormones are
   valuable because repeatability in hormone levels might be a mechanism
   that drives repeatability in behavior ({''}personality{''}).
   Testosterone is predicted to promote territorial aggression and suppress
   parental behaviors. In our population of eastern bluebirds (Sialia
   sialis), parental care and nest defense aggression toward a
   heterospecific are repeatable. We tested the hypothesis that
   repeatability of testosterone levels within individuals underlies
   repeatable behaviors observed in our population. We measured nestling
   provisioning and aggressive nest defense against a heterospecific. After
   behavioral observations we captured either the male or female bluebird,
   and determined initial testosterone levels and maximum capacity of the
   gonads to secrete testosterone by injecting gonadotropin-releasing
   hormone (GnRH). We found among-individual variation in initial
   testosterone levels for males and females. Individual males were
   repeatable in both initial and GnRH-induced testosterone levels across
   behavioral contexts, while individual females were repeatable in
   GnRH-induced testosterone levels. However, testosterone levels were not
   significantly related to parental or nest defense behaviors, suggesting
   that repeatable testosterone levels may not drive repeatable parental
   and heterospecific nest defense behaviors in this population. The
   absence of a relationship between testosterone and parental and
   heterospecific nest defense behaviors might be due to among-individual
   variation in testosterone levels. Considering the sources of variation
   in testosterone levels may reveal why some populations exhibit high
   individual variation in hormone levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, with
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) initiating the endocrine cascade,
   regulates testosterone secretion. Testosterone, through its pleiotropic
   effects, plays a crucial role in coordinating morphology, physiology and
   behavior in a reproductive context. The concentration of circulating
   testosterone, however, varies over the course of the day and in response
   to other internal or external stimuli, potentially making it difficult
   to relate testosterone sampled at one time point with traits of
   interest. Many researchers now utilize the administration of exogenous
   GnRH to elicit a standardized stimulation of testosterone secretion.
   However, it has remained unclear if and how this exogenously stimulated
   activation of the HPG axis is related with endogenously regulated
   testosterone that is capable of influencing testosterone related traits.
   Repeated measures of a hormone can uncover consistent individual
   variation in hormonal differences at the HPG axis level, variation that
   potentially stems from underlying genetic variation in a population
   experiencing identical environmental cues. Thus, we asked, using the
   house sparrow (Passer domesticus), how daily endogenous variation in
   testosterone profiles relates to GnRH-induced testosterone secretion.
   Further, we explore the relationship between endogenous daily
   testosterone peaks and GnRH-induced testosterone with badge size, a
   morphological trait related with status within a social group. We found
   that GnRH-induced testosterone levels reflect a highly repeatable
   hormonal phenotype that is strongly correlated with nighttime
   testosterone levels. The results demonstrate the usefulness of
   GnRH-induced testosterone in studies aimed at understanding individual
   variation and selection on endogenously regulated testosterone levels
   and the potential importance of nighttime testosterone levels to
   physiology and behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although both mothers and fathers are essential sources of information
   to address early socioemotional/behavioral (SEB) problems, there
   continues to be a dearth of studies considering both parental views. A
   sample of 208 toddlers (M-age = 19.3 months) was recruited through
   public child health centers. Both parents of 172 toddlers (76 boys, 96
   girls) completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1-5 (T.M. Achenbach
   \& L.A. Rescorla, 2000; Finnish translation by F. Almqvist, 2001).
   Correspondence (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICCs) between the
   maternal and paternal CBCL ratings was good (.64) for the Internalizing
   and excellent (.76) for the Externalizing and Total Problems scores
   whereas ICCs varied from .45 for the Withdrawn to .76 for the Sleep
   Problems and Aggressive Behavior syndrome scores. Regarding
   discrepancies, mothers consistently reported higher CBCL scale scores
   than did fathers. Most significant differences between the parental
   ratings were found on the Aggressive Behavior syndrome, Externalizing,
   and Total Problems scales. Interparental rating discrepancies increased
   with elevations in the corresponding CBCL scale scores. Positive
   correlations were found between maternal, but not paternal, parenting
   stress and interparental rating discrepancies on the CBCL. The observed
   differences between maternal and paternal ratings highlight the
   importance of gathering reports from both parents when assessing early
   SEB problems. The findings are more profoundly discussed in the article.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many animals differ consistently in the way they behave across time and
   context. This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life
   history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the
   relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration.
   This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in
   which only part of a population migrates while the other remains
   resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and
   stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two
   partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva
   selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent
   behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within
   species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species.
   Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the
   phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and
   overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S.
   selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus.
   The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently
   across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between
   migratory and resident flies. They also provide evidence for the
   possible role of behavioural differences in influencing partial
   migration decisions within populations. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Early social environment can play a significant role in shaping
   behavioural development. For instance, in many social mammals and birds,
   isolation rearing results in individuals that are less exploratory,
   shyer, less social and more aggressive than individuals raised in
   groups. Moreover, dynamic aspects of social environments, such as the
   nature of relationships between individuals, can also impact the
   trajectory of development. We tested if being raised alone or socially
   affects behavioural development in the family-living tree skink, Egernia
   striolata. Juveniles were raised in two treatments: alone or in a pair.
   We assayed exploration, boldness, sociability and aggression repeatedly
   throughout each juvenile's first year of life, and also assessed social
   interactions between pairs to determine if juveniles formed
   dominant-subordinate relationships. We found that male and/or the larger
   skinks within social pairs were dominant. Developing within this social
   environment reduced skink growth, and subordinate skinks were more prone
   to tail loss. Thus, living with a conspecific was costly for E.
   striolata. The predicted negative effects of isolation failed to
   materialize. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in
   behavioural traits depending on the social environment ( isolated,
   dominant or subordinate member of a pair). Isolated skinks were more
   social than subordinate skinks. Subordinate skinks also became more
   aggressive over time, whereas isolated and dominant skinks showed
   invariable aggression. Dominant skinks became bolder over time, whereas
   isolated and subordinate skinks were relatively stable in their
   boldness. In summary, our study is evidence that isolation rearing does
   not consistently affect behaviour across all social taxa. Our study also
   demonstrates that the social environment plays an important role in
   behavioural development of a family-living lizard.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying consistent differences in behaviour among individuals is
   vital to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of
   animal personality. To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of
   a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among
   individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are
   available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to
   estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the
   repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows
   for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon,
   enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively
   breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin
   Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different
   life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state
   could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the
   population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4
   behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object
   exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and
   narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer
   variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable
   behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation
   between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in
   other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately
   repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual
   correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object
   exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately
   heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance). This
   study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for
   selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors can affect the probability for an individual to obtain a
   high social rank, including size, weaponry, and behavioral attributes
   such as aggression. Recent experiences of winning or losing can also
   affect the chances of winning future contests, commonly referred to as
   ``winner-loser effects{''}. Individuals often differ in behavior in a
   consistent way, including in aggression, thereby showing differences in
   personality. However, the relative importance of recent experience and
   aspects of personality in determining rank, as well as the extent to
   which winning or losing affects aggression, has rarely been studied.
   Here, we investigate these questions using male domestic fowl. We
   matched males for body size, comb size, and aggression in pair-wise
   duels to: 1) study the effect of contest outcome on aggression and 2)
   compare the effect of individual aggression and contest experience on
   future social status in small groups. We found that aggression was a
   highly repeatable personality trait and that aggression increased after
   winning and decreased after losing. Nevertheless, such winner-loser
   effects were not enough to increase the odds of becoming dominant in a
   small group. Instead, aggressiveness measured prior to a contest
   experience best predicted future rank. Boldness and exploration did not
   predict rank and of the 2, only boldness was positively correlated with
   aggressiveness. We conclude that for male domestic fowl in contests
   among phenotypically matched contestants, aggressiveness is more
   important for obtaining high rank than winner-loser effects, or other
   aspects of personality.}},

Abstract = {{In a fluctuating environment, the optimal level of exploratory behavior
   depends on the proportion of current risks and benefits. The exploratory
   behavior is, therefore, often subjected to heterogenous selection. In
   populations of commensal rodents living in close proximity of humans,
   this pressure is further increased by pest management. We hypothesize
   that the black rat (Rattus rattus) responds to this pressure by either
   high behavioral flexibility or by development of personality types. The
   aim of this study was to analyze exploratory behavior and boldness of
   wild black rats and its changes over time to determine whether
   exploratory behavior is a personality trait in black rats. Studies on
   animals with unreduced variability are necessary for determination of
   normal range of behaviors. The behavior in the open field and hole board
   tests yielded 1 multivariate variable representing exploratory behavior
   and 1 representing boldness. The hole board test additionally provided
   an axis representing exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior showed
   moderate to high repeatability, even though we observed a considerable
   effect of habituation. Exploratory behavior was also strongly correlated
   across contexts; therefore, our results suggest that the black rat
   responds to heterogenous selection pressure by developing personality
   types. We also found a strong effect of litter identity on some aspects
   of the exploratory behavior. Boldness was less repeatable, which we
   interpret as high behavioral flexibility in this behavioral trait. In
   concordance with our hypothesis, the personality types in exploratory
   behavior, but not in boldness, are possibly maintained by heterogenous
   selection pressure created by human pest management.}},

   (NOR-COR) Prevention Study. Methods: In the NOR-COR study 1127 coronary
   heart disease (CHD) patients completed a self-report questionnaire
   consisting of 249 questions, of which there are both validated
   instruments and de novo questions. Test-retest reliability of the

   (+/- 6.4) days. Reproducibility values for questions in the first part
   of the questionnaire did not differ from those in the latter. A good to
   very good reproducibility was found for lifestyle factors (smoking: =

Abstract = {{Background. Functional decline among patients with mental illness is not
   unique to individuals with psychotic disorders. Despite this, research
   on early predictors of functional outcome mainly focused on individuals
   thought to have an `at risk mental state' (ARMS) for psychosis. There is
   evidence suggesting that certain early vulnerability markers, such as
   neurological soft signs (NSS), may explain variability in functional
   outcomes independent of the level of psychosis risk and the traditional
   diagnostic classification.
   Method. Structural equation modeling was applied to baseline data from a
   prospective longitudinal study of 138 young individuals in treatment
   with secondary services for non-psychotic disorders. We evaluated
   theoretically based models of pathways to functional outcome starting
   from NSS. The intervening variables were established according to
   previous evidence and drawn from two general categories: cognition
   (neuro-and social-) and negative symptoms (expressive and experiential).
   Results. A final trimmed model was a single path running from NSS to
   neurocognition to experiential negative symptoms to outcome. It could
   not be improved by adding or dropping connections that would change the
   single path to multiple paths. The indirect effect from NSS to outcome
   was significant. The validity of the model was independent of the ARMS
   status and the psychiatric diagnosis.
   Conclusions. Our results provide evidence for a single pathway model in
   which the starting and intervening variables represent modifiable
   trans-diagnostic therapeutic targets to improve functional trajectories
   in young individuals with a recent-onset psychiatric diagnosis and
   different levels of psychosis risk.}},

   physiology during early postnatal life, and in particular the emergence
   of such differences among litter siblings, has been hardly explored in
   mammals under natural conditions. We studied such within-litter
   differences in behavior in European rabbit pups Oryctolagus cuniculus
   prior to weaning, and whether and how these differences co-varied with
   other individual characteristics such as postnatal body temperature and
   early growth. The study was conducted under semi natural conditions in a
   colony of rabbits of wild origin, where the young were born and
   developed in nursery burrows. We equipped two siblings per litter with
   interscapular skin temperature loggers on postnatal day 2 and recorded
   temperature profiles for 48 h. Individual body (skin) temperatures of
   pups within litters were repeatable across time, indicating the
   existence of consistent individual differences. Such differences within
   litters were associated with relative differences in pre-weaning growth,
   revealing that relatively warmer pups showed a greater increase in body
   mass during the nest period. Between postnatal days 12 and 17, after the
   pups had reached a developmental stage of greater mobility, we carried
   out different behavioral tests: a handling-restraint test, an open field
   test and a jump-down test from a platform. Individual responses in the
   former two tests were associated, as those pups showing a quicker
   straggling response to restraint during handling also exhibited greater
   exploratory activity in the open field. This correlation across contexts
   suggests the existence of personality types in wild rabbits at an early
   developmental stage. Furthermore, pups' behavioral responses were
   strongly associated with their relative Within-litter body mass at
   testing. Animals with a lower body mass compared to their siblings
   showed a relatively quicker struggle response to handling restraint and
   covered a relatively larger distance in the open field, suggesting
   greater reactivity and responsiveness of relatively lighter pups in
   these tests. In contrast, relatively heavier pups jumped sooner from the
   platform, which may have been due to their greater physical maturation.
   In conclusion, our study shows that individual differences in behavior
   and associated differences in body temperature and growth are already
   present during early postnatal life, although such relationships can be
   easily overlooked, as they predominantly emerge as relative differences
   among littermates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Variabilichromis moorii (Vm) to prey on benthic invertebrates, while
   other zoobenthivorous fishes are chased from the territories. We
   conducted an experiment in which caged Nm fish were exposed twice to
   each Vm fish in natural habitats. Results indicated repeatable
   individual variations in Vm aggression towards Nm. Moreover, diving
   observations indicated that Nm fish frequently used some of Vm
   territories inside their own territories, but rarely or never used
   others. This uneven use of Vm territories by the Nm fish was negatively
   correlated with individual variations in Vm aggression. We conclude that

Title = {{Construction of Individual Morphological Brain Networks with Multiple
   Morphometric Features}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, researchers have increased attentions to the
   morphological brain network, which is generally constructed by measuring
   the mathematical correlation across regions using a certain morphometric
   feature, such as regional cortical thickness and voxel intensity.
   However, cerebral structure can be characterized by various factors,
   such as regional volume, surface area, and curvature. Moreover, most of
   the morphological brain networks are population-based, which has
   limitations in the investigations of individual difference and clinical
   applications. Hence, we have extended previous studies by proposing a
   novel method for realizing the construction of an individual-based
   morphological brain network through a combination of multiple
   morphometric features. In particular, interregional connections are
   estimated using our newly introduced feature vectors, namely, the
   Pearson correlation coefficient of the concatenation of seven
   morphometric features. Experiments were performed on a healthy cohort of
   55 subjects (24 males aged from 20 to 29 and 31 females aged from 20 to
   28) each scanned twice, and reproducibility was evaluated through
   test-retest reliability. The robustness of morphometric features was
   measured firstly to select the more reproducible features to form the
   connectomes. Then the topological properties were analyzed and compared
   with previous reports of different modalities. Small-worldness was
   observed in all the subjects at the range of the entire network sparsity
   (20-40\%), and configurations were comparable with previous findings at
   the sparsity of 23\%. The spatial distributions of the hub were found to
   be significantly influenced by the individual variances, and the hubs
   obtained by averaging across subjects and sparsities showed
   correspondence with previous reports. The intraclass coefficient of
   graphic properties (clustering coefficient = 0.83, characteristic path
   length = 0.81, betweenness centrality = 0.78) indicates the robustness
   of the present method. Results demonstrate that the multiple
   morphometric features can be applied to form a rational reproducible
   individual-based morphological brain network.}},

   limited pleiotropic effects of testosterone on immune function, sexual
   signaling, and parental investment}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{How and why individuals differ from each other is a central question in
   behavioral and evolutionary ecology, because selection particularly acts
   on this among-individual variation. It is therefore important to
   accurately partition phenotypic variances into their within- and
   between-individual components. Partitioning covariances into both
   components can also inform about underlying mechanistic pathways that
   potentially interlink trait expression. In the current study, we applied
   such a (co) variance partitioning approach to test key predictions of
   two central hypotheses in behavioral ecology, namely the
   immunocompetence handicap hypothesis and the challenge hypothesis. To
   this end, we assessed potential pleiotropic effects of testosterone on
   male sexual signaling, immune function, and parental care. We here
   repeatedly measured a set of relevant traits in 47 breeding pairs of
   captive canaries (Serinus canaria). We found that a within-individual
   increase in female testosterone level suppressed immune function.
   Furthermore, testosterone levels were positively related to male song
   repertoire size as an important component of sexual signaling at the
   between-male level. These were, however, the only relevant significant
   correlations. Overall, our data do therefore not convincingly support
   the hypotheses tested and suggest rather limited hormonal pleiotropic
   effects of testosterone on immune function, parental care, and male
   sexual signaling, at least in our study system.
   Significance statement
   Phenotypic variances and covariances can nowadays be partitioned easily
   into within- and between-individual components. These components inform
   about trait repeatability and the extent to which multiple traits form
   phenotypic suites of traits, as well as about their joint underlying
   mechanistic pathways. Testosterone for example, may be key to mediate
   the expression of suites of traits in many vertebrate species. We here
   used captive canaries and repeatedly measured male and female traits,
   relevant in the context of endocrinology, sexual signaling, immune
   function, and parental investment. For both sexes, we report
   particularly weak correlations between testosterone and all other
   measured traits at both within-and between-individual levels. Our case
   study thus questions the pleiotropic effects of testosterone, but
   exemplifies the applicability and relevance of (co)variance partitioning
   in behavioral ecological research.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sociability, how individuals interact with conspecifics, is considered
   to be a key axis of animal personality. Consistent differences between
   individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some
   taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability
   across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious
   species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although
   repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both
   important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been
   studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple
   behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is
   still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of
   sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to
   determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two
   broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population
   of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to
   investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals'
   states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected
   each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed
   factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to
   reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different
   conspecifics with which individuals associated (their `choosiness' of
   social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were
   all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older
   dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more
   selective about group members when there was more food, and when they
   were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences
   exist among females in this population, and females' measures of
   sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long
   term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals'
   states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females'
   patterns of sociability over shorter periods. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{Neophobia is an important personality trait that allows animals to
   minimize exposure to threat. We investigated the existence of consistent
   individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective
   was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with
   behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful
   situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of
   neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a
   feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the
   presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in
   the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental
   treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among
   individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation
   (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding
   bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher
   concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic
   stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic
   (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the
   presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural
   response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the
   existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and
   physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable
   indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{396-406}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{To date, most studies investigating the relationship between personality
   traits and fitness have focused on a single measure of fitness (such as
   survival) at a specific life stage. However, many personality traits
   likely have multiple effects on fitness, potentially operating across
   different functional contexts and stages of development. Here, we
   address the fitness consequences of boldness, under seminatural
   conditions, across life stages and functional contexts in largemouth
   bass (Micropterus salmoides). Specifically, we report the effect of
   boldness on (1) juvenile survivorship in an outdoor pond containing
   natural prey and predators and (2) adult reproductive success in three
   outdoor ponds across three reproductive seasons (years). Juvenile
   survival was negatively affected by boldness, with bolder juveniles
   having a lower probability of survival than shyer juveniles. In
   contrast, bolder adult male bass had greater reproductive success than
   their shyer male counterparts. Female reproductive success was not
   affected by boldness. These findings demonstrate that boldness can
   affect fitness differently across life stages. Further, boldness was
   highly consistent across years and significantly heritable, which
   suggests that boldness has a genetic component. Thus, our results
   support theory suggesting that fitness trade-offs across life stages may
   contribute to the maintenance of personality variation within

Abstract = {{1. Given fundamental energetic trade-offs among growth, maintenance and
   reproduction, individual differences in energy saving should have
   consequences for survival and reproductive success. Many endotherms use
   periodic heterothermy to reduce energy and water requirements and
   individual variation in heterothermy should have fitness consequences.
   However, attempts to disentangle individual- and population-level
   variation in heterothermy are scarce. 2. Here, we quantified patterns of
   heterothermy of 55 free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus),
   food-hoarding hibernators. Over five hibernation periods, we obtained a
   total of 7108 daily individual heterothermy indices (median: 118 per
   individual). 3. Based on an individual reaction norm approach, we found
   that the use of heterothermy was repeatable and varied among individuals
   of the same population under similar environmental conditions. This
   among-individual variation had consequences for winter survival and
   reproductive success. Individuals using less heterothermy at the
   beginning of the winter had decreased survival in resource-rich but not
   in resource-poor years and higher reproductive success in the subsequent

Abstract = {{The sleep homeostatic Process S reflects the build-up of sleep pressure

   as an index of Process S. There is considerable interindividual
   variability in the sleep homeostatic responses to sleep and sleep
   deprivation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether

   Polysomnographic recordings of 8 nights (12-h sleep opportunities, 22:

   wakefulness were performed in 11 healthy young adults. Empirical mean
   slow wave activity per non-REM sleep episode at episode mid-points were

   Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.48 to 0.56, which

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Animals show consistent individual behavioural differences
   in many species. Further, behavioural traits (personality traits) form
   behavioural syndromes, characterised by correlations between different
   behaviours. Mechanisms maintaining these correlations could be
   constrained due to underlying relationships with cognitive traits. There
   is growing evidence for the non-independence of animal personality and
   general cognitive abilities in animals, but so far, studies on the
   direction of the relationship between them revealed contradictory
   results. Still, it is hypothesised that individuals may exhibit
   consistent learning and decision styles. Fast behavioural types
   (consistently bolder and more active individuals) are expected to show
   faster learning styles. Slow behavioural types in contrast are assumed
   to learn slower but more accurately. This can be caused by a
   speed-accuracy trade-off that individuals face during decision making.
   We measured the repeatability of three personality and four spatial
   cognitive traits in adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We
   analysed correlations among personality traits (behavioural syndrome).
   We further investigated the relationships between personality and
   spatial cognitive traits as a first step exploring the potential
   connection between personality and cognition in this species.
   Results: Our results showed that exploration, activity and boldness were
   repeatable in adult mice. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was
   also significantly repeatable, as well as spatial learning performance
   and decision speed. We found no repeatability of decision accuracy.
   Harvest mice showed a behavioural syndrome as we observed strong
   positive correlations between personality traits. The speed-accuracy
   trade-off was not apparent within, nor between individuals.
   Nevertheless, we found weak evidence for a relationship between
   personality and spatial cognitive traits as fast behavioural types
   learned a spatial orientation task faster than slow types, and shyer
   harvest mice made decisions quicker than bolder mice.
   Conclusions: Given these correlations, our data provided some first
   insights into the relationship between personality and spatial cognitive
   traits in harvest mice and will hopefully stimulate more studies in this
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Fish personality traits, such as swimming activity, or personality
   related emergent behavioural properties, such as the degree of space use
   shown by an individual fish, should affect encounter rates between
   individual fish and fishing gear. Increased encounters should in turn
   drive vulnerability to capture by passively operated gears. However,
   empirical evidence documenting a relationship between activity-based
   behaviours and vulnerability to capture by passive fishing gear in the
   wild is limited. Using whole-lake acoustic telemetry, we first
   documented significant repeatabilities over several months in a suite of
   encounter rate-associated behaviours (swimming distance, activity space
   size, time on baited feeding sites, switching frequency among baited
   feeding sites, distance to the lake bottom) in two recreationally
   important benthivorous cyprinid species, the common carp (Cyprinus
   carpio) and tench (Tinca tinca). We then experimentally targeted both
   species using stationary angling on baited feeding sites. Individual
   fish regularly visited the angling sites, documenting that the fishes
   encountered the angling baits. When attempting to explain individual
   variation in vulnerability as a function of repeatable behavioural
   traits, we found no evidence of a significant relationship among various
   encounter-based behaviours and vulnerability to angling for both
   species. There was also no evidence for size selection or for
   energetically less conditioned fish to be more vulnerable. The data
   cumulatively suggest that fine-scale behaviours after encountering a
   bait (e.g., frequency of bait intake) may be ultimately decisive for

Abstract = {{Individual specialisations, which involve the repetition of specific
   behaviours or dietary choices over time, have been suggested to benefit
   animals by avoiding competition with conspecifics and increasing
   individual foraging efficiency. Among seabirds, resident and benthic
   species are thought to be good models to study inter-individual
   variation as they repetitively exploit the same environment. We
   investigated foraging behaviour, isotopic niche and diet in the
   Kerguelen shag Phalacrocorax verrucosus during both the incubation and
   chick-rearing periods for the same individuals to determine the effect
   of sex, breeding stage, body mass and morphometrics on mean foraging
   metrics and their consistency. There were large differences between
   individuals in foraging behaviour and consistency, with strong
   individual specialisations in dive depths and heading from the colony.
   Stable isotopes revealed specialisations in feeding strategies, across
   multiple temporal scales. Specifically, individuals showed medium term
   specialisations in feeding strategies during the breeding season, as
   well as long-term consistency. A clustering analysis revealed 4
   different foraging strategies displaying significantly different delta
   N-15 values and body masses. There were no sex or stage biases to
   clusters and individuals in different clusters did not differ in their
   morphology. Importantly, the results suggest that the different
   strategies emphasized were related to individual prey preferences rather
   than intrinsic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-taking decisions in front of a predator are crucial for the fitness
   of the animals. Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on
   escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field
   study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent
   individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain
   between-individual variation in risktaking behaviour in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the
   time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary
   during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated
   risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and
   parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect
   individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape
   ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within-and
   between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day.
   We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling
   feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as
   shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases
   correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall,
   time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour,
   but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in
   yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a
   condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect
   immediate risk-taking decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The current study investigated the behavioural response of Lepomis
   macrochirus following exposures to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). For
   this, L. macrochirus were held at ambient pCO(2) (160 mu atm pCO(2)) for

   and then returned to ambient conditions for a further 5 days to recover.
   At the end of each exposure period, several behavioural metrics were
   quantified (boldness, lateralization and activity). Data showed no
   change in lateralization and most metrics associated with performance
   and boldness. During the boldness test, however, average velocity,
   velocity in the thigmotaxis (outer) zone and proportion of activity in
   the thigmotaxis zone increased with pCO(2) exposure. During
   post-exposure, average velocity of L. macrochirus decreased. In
   addition, individual rank was repeatable during the pre-exposure and
   post-exposure period in three of the 17 metrics investigated (average
   velocity in the middle zone, average velocity near object and total
   shuttles to the object zone), but not during the CO2 exposure period,
   suggesting that elevated pCO(2) disrupted some behavioural performances.
   Overall, this study found elevated pCO(2) caused disruption to

Abstract = {{Objectives: The Dominic Interactive for Adolescents-Revised (DIA-R) is a
   multimedia self-report screen for 9 mental disorders, borderline
   personality traits, and suicidality defined by the fifth edition of the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This
   study aimed to examine the reliability and the validity of this
   instrument.
   Methods: French-and English-speaking adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (N
   = 447) were recruited from schools and clinical settings in Montreal and
   were evaluated twice. The internal consistency was estimated by Cronbach
   alpha coefficients and the test-retest reliability by intraclass
   correlation coefficients. Cutoff points on the DIA-R scales were
   determined by using clinically relevant measures for defining external
   validation criteria: the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
   Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and
   the Abbreviated-Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines. Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analyses provided accuracy estimates (area under
   the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio) to evaluate
   the ability of the DIA-R scales to predict external criteria.
   Results: For most of the DIA-R scales, reliability coefficients were
   excellent or moderate. High or moderate accuracy estimates from ROC
   analyses demonstrated the ability of the DIA-R thresholds to predict
   psychopathological conditions. These thresholds were generally capable
   to discriminate between clinical and school subsamples. However, the
   validity of the obsessions/compulsions scale was too low.
   Conclusions: Findings clearly support the reliability and the validity
   of the DIA-R. This instrument may be useful to assess a wide range of
   adolescents' mental health problems in the continuum of services. This
   conclusion applies to all scales, except the obsessions/compulsions one.}},

Abstract = {{1. Labile characters allow individuals to flexibly adjust their
   phenotype to changes in environmental conditions. There is growing
   evidence that individuals can differ both in average expression and
   level of plasticity in this type of character. Both of these aspects are
   studied in conjunction within a reaction norm framework.
   2. Theoreticians have investigated the factors promoting variation in
   reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes (level of
   plasticity) of a key labile character: behaviour. A general prediction
   from their work is that selection will favour the evolution of
   repeatable individual variation in level of plasticity only under
   certain ecological conditions. While factors promoting individual
   repeatability of plasticity have thus been identified, empirical
   estimates of this phenomenon are largely lacking for wild populations.
   3. We assayed aggressiveness of individual male great tits (Parus major)
   twice during their egg-laying stage and twice during their
   egg-incubation stage to quantify each male's level of seasonal
   plasticity. This procedure was applied during six consecutive years; all
   males breeding in our plots during those years were assayed, resulting
   in repeated measures of individual reaction norms for any individual
   breeding in multiple years. We quantified among-and within-individual
   variation in reaction norm components, allowing us to estimate
   repeatability of seasonal plasticity. Using social pedigree information,
   we further partitioned reaction norm components into their additive
   genetic and permanent environmental counterparts.
   4. Cross-year individual repeatability for the intercepts (average
   aggressiveness) and slopes (level of seasonal plasticity) of the
   aggressiveness reaction norms were 0.574 and 0.516 respectively. The
   mean of the posterior distributions suggested modest heritabilities
   (h(2) = 0.260 for intercepts; h(2) = 0.266 for slopes), but these
   estimates were relatively uncertain. Males behaved more aggressively in
   areas with higher breeding densities, and became less aggressive and
   less plastic with increasing age; plasticity thus varied within
   individuals and was multidimensional in nature.
   5. This empirical study quantified cross-year individual repeatability,
   heritability and agerelated reversible plasticity in behaviour.
   Acknowledging such patterns of multi-level variation is important not
   only for testing behavioural ecology theory concerning the evolution of
   repeatable differences in behavioural plasticity but also for predicting
   how reversible plasticity may evolve in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Basal metabolic rate (BMR) correlates with the cost of life in
   endothermic animals. It usually differs consistently among individuals
   in a population, but it may be adjusted in response to predictable or
   unpredictable changes in the environment. The phenotypic flexibility of
   BMR is considered an adaptation to living in a stochastic environment;
   however, whether it is also repeatable it is still unexplored. Assuming
   that variations in phenotypic flexibility are evolutionarily important,
   we hypothesized that they are consistently different among individuals.
   We predicted that not only BMR but also its flexibility in response to
   changes in ambient temperature (T-a) are repeatable on short- and
   long-term timescales. To examine this, we acclimated Siberian hamsters
   (Phodopus sungorus) for 100 d to winterlike and then to summerlike
   conditions, and after each acclimation we exposed them interchangeably
   to 10 degrees and 28 degrees C for 14 d. The difference in BMR measured
   after each exposure defined an individual's phenotypic flexibility
   (BMR). BMR was repeatable within and among seasons. It was also flexible
   in both seasons, but in winter this flexibility was lower in individuals
   responding to seasonal changes than in nonresponding ones. When we
   accounted for individual responsiveness, the repeatability of BMR was
   significant in winter ( = 0.48, P = 0.01) and in summer ( = 0.55, P =
   0.005). Finally, the flexibility of BMR in response to changes in T-a
   was also repeatable on a long-term timescale, that is, among seasons ( =
   0.31, P = 0.008). Our results indicate the evolutionary importance of
   the phenotypic flexibility of energy metabolism and suggest that it may
   be subject to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in hormone levels and metabolic rates
   have been proposed to be potential state variables underlying consistent
   individual differences in behaviour (i.e. animal personality). However,
   it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential
   state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We
   address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird
   species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual
   differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability
   estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we
   quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates
   and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability
   estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low
   repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that
   metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating
   adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i)
   for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing
   interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed
   in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone
   levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now
   required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic
   rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try
   to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the
   relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In
   addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of
   variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability
   estimates because these two indices carry different information. We
   discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies,
   including meta-analyses.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range (15-30 Hz) recorded
   from human sensorimotor cortex is of increasing interest as a putative
   biomarker of motor system function and dysfunction. Despite its
   increasing use in basic and clinical research, surprisingly little is
   known about the test-retest reliability of spectral power and peak
   frequency measures of beta oscillatory signals from sensorimotor cortex.
   Establishing that these beta measures are stable over time in healthy
   populations is a necessary precursor to their use in the clinic.
   Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate
   intra-individual reliability of beta-band oscillations over six
   sessions, focusing on changes in beta activity during movement
   (Movement-Related Beta Desynchronization, MRBD) and after movement
   termination (Post-Movement Beta Rebound, PMBR). Subjects performed
   visually-cued unimanual wrist flexion and extension. We assessed
   Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and between-session
   correlations for spectral power and peak frequency measures of
   movement-related and resting beta activity. Movement-related and resting
   beta power from both sensorimotor cortices was highly reliable across
   sessions. Resting beta power yielded highest reliability (average
   ICC=0.903), followed by MRBD (average ICC=0.886) and PMBR (average
   ICC=0.663). Notably, peak frequency measures yielded lower ICC values
   compared to the assessment of spectral power, particularly for
   movement-related beta activity (ICC=0.386-0.402). Our data highlight
   that power measures of movement-related beta oscillations are highly
   reliable, while corresponding peak frequency measures show greater
   intra-individual variability across sessions. Importantly, our finding
   that beta power estimates show high intra-individual reliability over
   time serves to validate the notion that these measures reflect
   meaningful individual differences that can be utilised in basic research
   and clinical studies.}},

Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{83-94}},

Abstract = {{The potential for populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on
   individual variation in traits under selection and how multiple traits
   are correlated. While fitness relates to the performance of animals in
   the wild, most of the research on evolutionary potential of behavioural
   traits has used captive or mesocosm settings, especially with aquatic
   organisms. We investigated the individual level consistency
   (personalities) and correlations (behavioural syndromes) of
   fitness-related behavioural traits displayed by a harvested marine fish
   in the natural environment, and the potential of such individual level
   behaviour to constrain adaptive evolution. For this, we acoustically
   tracked 303 individuals of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, over a period of
   3 years from two populations in southern Norway. We then estimated
   repeatability and correlations between four behavioural traits: diel
   vertical migration, activity, home range and dispersal. Average autonomy
   was estimated as a measure of the potential of the observed behavioural
   syndromes to constrain evolution. We found a moderate to high individual
   consistency in all behavioural traits (mean repeatability 0.41, range
   0.22-0.66) suggesting that they reflect fish personalities. Also,
   behavioural traits were structured into behavioural syndromes, where one
   population displayed a more integrated behavioural syndrome (all the
   four traits correlated) than the other (only home range and dispersal
   correlated). In both populations, the magnitude of these behavioural
   syndromes could potentially constrain evolution, as revealed by average
   autonomy values significantly below 1. Our study provides strong
   empirical support to the idea that natural and human-induced selection
   on behavioural traits can indeed drive adaptive evolution, and, further,
   that such evolutionary responses may be constrained by the correlational
   structure among multiple traits. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Many organisms rely on synchronizing the timing of their life-history
   events with those of other trophic levelsknown as phenological
   matchingfor survival or successful reproduction. In temperate deciduous
   forests, the extent of matching with the budburst date of key tree
   species is of particular relevance for many herbivorous insects and, in
   turn, insectivorous birds. In order to understand the ecological and
   evolutionary forces operating in these systems, we require knowledge of
   the factors influencing leaf emergence of tree communities. However,
   little is known about how phenology at the level of individual trees
   varies across landscapes, or how consistent this spatial variation is
   between different tree species. Here, we use field observations,
   collected over 2years, to characterize within- and between-species
   differences in spring phenology for 825 trees of six species (Quercus
   robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Fagus sylvatica, Betula pendula, Corylus
   avellana, and Acer pseudoplatanus) in a 385-ha woodland. We explore
   environmental predictors of individual variation in budburst date and
   bud development rate and establish how these phenological traits vary
   over space. Trees of all species showed markedly consistent individual
   differences in their budburst timing. Bud development rate also varied
   considerably between individuals and was repeatable in oak, beech, and
   sycamore. We identified multiple predictors of budburst date including
   altitude, local temperature, and soil type, but none were universal
   across species. Furthermore, we found no evidence for interspecific
   covariance of phenology over space within the woodland. These analyses
   suggest that phenological landscapes are highly complex, varying over
   small spatial scales both within and between species. Such spatial
   variation in vegetation phenology is likely to influence patterns of
   selection on phenology within populations of consumers. Knowledge of the
   factors shaping the phenological environments experienced by animals is
   therefore likely to be key in understanding how these evolutionary
   processes operate.}},

Abstract = {{Despite ample evidence on risky drinking in adolescence and beyond,
   little is known about early alcohol-related precursors. The present
   study investigates whether preschool children are already familiar with
   the emotional changes that are likely to occur when people drink
   alcohol, that is, their alcohol expectancies. Based on the circumplex
   model of affect (CMA; Russell, 1980), expectancies (12 items for alcohol
   and 12 for soft drinks) were assessed using the Berkeley Puppet
   Interview (BPI; Measelle, Ablow, Cowan, \& Cowan, 1998) among 198 3-to
   6-year-olds (52.5\% girls) in French-speaking Switzerland who had some
   knowledge of alcoholic beverages. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed
   the 4-dimensional factor structure (arousal-positive, arousal-negative,
   sedation-positive, sedationnegative) as assumed by the CMA for alcohol
   expectancies but not for soft drink expectancies. For the former,
   intraclass correlation coefficients showed an excellent interrater
   reliability and a satisfactory test-retest reliability. A paired-sample
   t test revealed that girls in particular endorsed positive alcohol
   expectancies more frequently than negative expectancies. There was no
   significant age difference in any expectancy dimension. This study
   indicates that alcohol expectancies already exist in preschoolers and
   that, even at this early age, expectancies can be classified according
   to the dimensions of valence and activation. This is important because
   alcohol expectancies have been found to be important predictors of early
   alcohol initiation and the development of risky drinking patterns later
   in life.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive signaling is an important component in animal communication,
   as it provides an efficient mechanism for settling conflicts over
   resources between competitors. In songbirds, a number of singing
   behaviors have been proposed to be aggressive signals used in territory
   defense, including song rate. Although aggressive signaling in songbirds
   has received considerable research attention, adequate evidence for most
   putative aggressive signals is not available. In this study, we
   experimentally investigated whether the song rate of male wood warblers
   Phylloscopus sibilatrix is a signal of their aggressive intent in
   male-male interactions. We found that males responded differentially to
   simulated territorial intrusions depending on the song rate of an
   intruder. Moreover, males that continued to sing during territorial
   contests increased their song rates, and this behavior predicted the
   strength of aggressive escalation by the signaler. These results suggest
   that song rate is an aggressive signal during male-male interactions in
   the wood warbler. We also found high intra-individual repeatability in
   the strength of aggressive response to simulated intrusions, likely
   reflecting differences in personality (aggressiveness) or quality of
   male wood warblers. We conclude that changes in singing rate may be an
   efficient mechanism of signaling immediate shifts in motivation of
   signalers during territorial contests, especially in species that lack
   large repertoires or have simple songs.}},

Abstract = {{1. Phenotypic variation exists in and at all levels of biological
   organization: variation exists among species, among-individuals
   within-populations, and in the case of l within-populations abile
   traits, within-individuals. Mixed-effects models represent ideal tools
   to quantify multilevel measurements of traits and are being increasingly
   used in evolutionary ecology. Mixed-effects models are relatively
   complex, and two main issues may be hampering their proper usage: (i)
   the relatively few educational resources available to teach new users
   how to implement and interpret them and (ii) the lack of tools to ensure
   that the statistical parameters of interest are correctly estimated. In
   this paper, we introduce Statistical Quantification of Individual
   Differences (SQuID), a simulation-based tool that can be used for
   research and educational purposes. SQuID creates a virtual world
   inhabited by subjects whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined
   phenotypic equation, which allows easy translation of biological
   hypotheses into quantifiable parameters. Statistical Quantification of
   Individual Differences currently models normally distributed traits with
   linear predictors, but SQuID is subject to further development and will
   adapt to handle more complex scenarios in the future. The current
   framework is suitable for performing simulation studies, determining
   optimal sampling designs for user-specific biological problems and
   making simulation-based inferences to aid in the interpretation of
   empirical studies. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences
   is also a teaching tool for biologists interested in learning, or
   teaching others, how to implement and interpret linear mixed-effects
   models when studying the processes causing phenotypic variation.
   Interface-based modules allow users to learn about these issues. As
   research on effects of sampling designs continues, new issues will be
   implemented in new modules, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian data.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Repeatable between-individual differences in the behavioural
   manifestation of underlying circadian rhythms determine chronotypes in
   humans and terrestrial animals. Here, we have repeatedly measured three
   circadian behaviours, awakening time, rest onset and rest duration, in
   the free-ranging pearly razorfish, Xyrithchys novacula, facilitated by
   acoustic tracking technology and hidden Markov models. In addition,
   daily travelled distance, a standard measure of daily activity as fish
   personality trait, was repeatedly assessed using a State-Space Model. We
   have decomposed the variance of these four behavioural traits using
   linear mixed models and estimated repeatability scores (R) while
   controlling for environmental co-variates: year of experimentation,
   spatial location of the activity, fish size and gender and their
   interactions. Between-and within-individual variance decomposition
   revealed significant Rs in all traits suggesting high predictability of
   individual circadian behavioural variation and the existence of
   chronotypes. The decomposition of the correlations among chronotypes and
   the personality trait studied here into between-and within-individual
   correlations did not reveal any significant correlation at
   between-individual level. We therefore propose circadian behavioural
   variation as an independent axis of the fish personality, and the study
   of chronotypes and their consequences as a novel dimension in
   understanding within-species fish behavioural diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of consistent individual differences in behavior,
   often termed ``personality,{''} for adapting and coping with threats and
   novel environmental conditions has advanced considerably during the last
   decade. However, advancements are almost exclusively associated with
   higher-order animals, whereas studies focusing on smaller aquatic
   organisms are still rare. Here, we show individual differences in the
   swimming behavior of Daphnia magna, a clonal freshwater invertebrate,
   before, during, and after being exposed to a lethal threat, ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR). We show consistency in swimming velocity among both
   mothers and daughters of D. magna in a neutral environment, whereas this
   pattern breaks down when exposed to UVR. Our study also, for the first
   time, illustrates how the ontogenetic development in swimming and
   refuge-seeking behavior of young individuals eventually approaches that
   of adults. Overall, we show that aquatic invertebrates are far from
   being identical robots, but instead they show considerable individual
   differences in behavior that can be attributed to both ontogenetic
   development and individual consistency. Our study also demonstrates, for
   the first time, that behavioral consistency and repeatability, that is,
   something resembling `` personality,{''} is context and state dependent

Abstract = {{Natural animal populations are increasingly exposed to human impacts on

   Among these impacts is exposure to anthropogenic contaminants. Any

   rapidly led to longer startle responses on average, but did not lead to

   There was no strong evidence that copper exposure led to changes in IIV.

   behavioural stability}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Behavioural phenotypes vary within and among individuals.
   While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin
   interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental
   factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an
   individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour
   (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and
   within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby
   causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual
   variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus
   bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the
   expression of these variance components were sex-specific.
   Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial
   design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was
   either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein.
   We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural
   (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits
   (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood.
   Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of
   within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein
   diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and
   behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate
   diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males,
   and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual
   variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein
   diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this
   effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual
   differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in
   female body weight.
   Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that
   dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual
   variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and
   individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'),
   though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call
   for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on
   the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such
   as behaviour and body weight.}},

Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although typically measured during the resting state, a
   growing literature is illustrating the ability to map intrinsic
   connectivity with functional MRI during task and naturalistic viewing
   conditions. These paradigms are drawing excitement due to their greater
   tolerability in clinical and developing populations and because they
   enable a wider range of analyses (e.g., inter-subject correlations). To
   be clinically useful, the test-retest reliability of connectivity
   measured during these paradigms needs to be established. This resource
   provides data for evaluating test-retest reliability for full-brain
   connectivity patterns detected during each of four scan conditions that
   differ with respect to level of engagement (rest, abstract animations,
   movie clips, flanker task). Data are provided for 13 participants, each
   scanned in 12 sessions with 10 minutes for each scan of the four
   conditions. Diffusion kurtosis imaging data was also obtained at each
   session.
   Findings: Technical validation and demonstrative reliability analyses
   were carried out at the connection-level using the Intraclass
   Correlation Coefficient and at network-level representations of the data
   using the Image Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. Variation in
   intrinsic functional connectivity across sessions was generally found to
   be greater than that attributable to scan condition. Between-condition
   reliability was generally high, particularly for the frontoparietal and
   default networks. Between-session reliabilities obtained separately for
   the different scan conditions were comparable, though notably lower than
   between-condition reliabilities.
   Conclusions: This resource provides a test-bed for quantifying the
   reliability of connectivity indices across subjects, conditions and
   time. The resource can be used to compare and optimize different
   frameworks for measuring connectivity and data collection parameters
   such as scan length. Additionally, investigators can explore the unique
   perspectives of the brain's functional architecture offered by each of

   Completion Method}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{215-231}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Performance-based personality assessment has advantages, and the
   sentence completion method is one of the most reliable of these
   techniques. We sought to derive rating scales for three major
   personality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism) based
   on Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank (RISB) protocols.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   Four successive samples of students (N = 231) completed the RISB and
   other measures. Rating scales were derived empirically and
   cross-validated against the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R).
   Additional validity evidence was obtained regarding symptomatic distress
   (SCL-90-R scales) and creativity (based on originality scores and expert
   judgments of student-generated drawings and poetry).
   RESULTS
   The scales could be applied reliably by undergraduate research
   assistants (mean individual intraclass correlation coefficients {[}ICCs]
   of.75,.79, and.71, respectively) and correlated well with self-reported
   traits (mean r values of.51,.57, and.58). Reliability of the finalized
   system was higher, with ICCs of.84,.83, and.79. RISB-rated traits
   correlated predictably with symptomatic distress. RISB-rated
   Psychoticism correlated strongly with the originality and judged
   creativity of drawings and poems. Psychoticism ratings were more
   strongly related to criterion measures than was the original
   self-report.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The sentence completion method can be used to rate personality traits
   reliably. These ratings correlate fairly strongly with the results of
   self-report inventories but sometimes correlate more strongly with
   theoretically relevant variables than do self-report scores.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To translate the Modified Swedish version of Postural

   stroke within the last 6 months, were strategically recruited and
   allocated into groups according to five different levels of function.
   Their performance on SwePASS-NV was video-recorded and then scored by

Abstract = {{Despite many positive benefits of ecotourism, increased human encounters

   quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia
   mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles
   have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a
   standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle
   behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of
   turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at
   distances of <= 3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified
   two distinct turtle personality types, `bold' and `timid', based upon
   145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five
   disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual
   repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles
   had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more
   timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses
   might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles
   might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator
   effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a
   turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote
   more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m
   distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that
   ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further,
   turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour
   operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of

Abstract = {{Treatment goals in psychoanalytic psychotherapy often include changes in
   underlying psychological structures, rather than only symptom reduction.
   This study examines changes in the anaclitic-introjective personality
   configurations following psychoanalytic psychotherapy with young adults
   in relation to outcomes. Thirty-three patients were interviewed
   pretreatment and at termination using the Object Relations Inventory
   (ORI). Prototype Matching of Anaclitic-Introjective Personality
   Configuration (PMAI) was applied to the ORI material by two independent
   judges (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.73). The patients were
   classified pretreatment as predominately anaclitic (n=13) or
   introjective (n=20). Outcome measures included the Symptom
   Checklist-90-R (SCL-90) and Differentiation-Relatedness scale (D-R)
   pretreatment, at termination, at the 1.5-year and three-year follow-up.
   Both groups improved post-treatment in terms of symptoms and
   developmental levels of representations of self, mother, and father. No
   significant differences between the anaclitic and the introjective group
   were found in this respect, and could not be expected due to the low
   power (0.27). The anaclitic group showed better balance between
   relatedness and self-definition post-treatment, while this improvement
   was not significant in the introjective group. Further and larger
   studies are needed to draw more far-reaching conclusions about the
   relations between changes in personality configurations over the course
   of treatment and the treatment efficacy. The clinical implications of
   this approach to underlying dynamic psychological structures are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: There is growing interest in the construct of alexithymia as
   it has been increasingly associated with a wide range of psychological
   disorders, in clinical samples and general population. In comparison to
   studies relating alexithymia and negative affectivity, there has been a
   scarcity of studies exploring such links with positive emotions. This
   study aims to explore the association between alexithymia and several
   discrete positive emotions, and to explore the mediating role of
   psychological inflexibility-related processes (decentering, experiential
   avoidance, resistance to feelings of compassion, and self-compassion) in
   such association.
   Method and participants: Using a cross-sectional design, 331
   participants were recruited from the general population (Mage=33.31,
   SD=14.03; 97 male and 234 female). Participants were asked to fill out
   the Portuguese version of the questionnaires.
   Results: Correlational analyses showed that alexithymia was associated
   with decreased positive emotions. Intraclass correlations suggested that
   people presenting with alexithymia showed lower positive emotional
   granularity, particularly regarding high arousal emotions. Alexithymia
   was also negatively associated with decentering and self-compassion, and
   positively associated with experiential avoidance and resistance to
   feelings of compassion. Mediation analyses showed that all variables
   were significant mediators of the association between alexithymia and
   positive emotions,
   Conclusions: Psychological inflexibility and related constructs may be
   important targets for therapeutic interventions with individuals with
   increased alexithymia.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The introduction of electrocardiogram gating in computed
   tomography (CT) angiography imaging of aortic disease raised questions
   whether diameters measured on diastolic images can lead to the
   undersizing of aortic endografts. As previous studies suggested that
   young patients may have the highest risk of an unintended undersize, the
   aim of our study was to analyze the strain of the thoracic aorta in a
   young patient cohort.
   Methods: We assessed the descending aorta of 52 patients (35 men, mean
   age 41.1 +/- 7.3 years) who underwent coronary CT angiography (CCTA)
   with suspected coronary artery disease. To reduce radiation dose, native
   calcium score scans triggered on late systole were compared with
   diastolic phase CCTA images. Cross-section areas were measured, and
   effective diameters were derived at 3 levels of the visible segment of
   the descending aorta (P1, P2, and P3) in systole and diastole. Aortic
   pulsatility (mm, d(systolic)-d(diastolic)) and strain (\%,
   {[}d(systolic)-d(diastolic)]/d(diastolic)) were calculated at each
   level. All measurements were performed 3 times by 2 independent readers
   to evaluate interreader and intrareader reproducibility.
   Results: A total of 936 measurements were performed. Significant
   differences were found between systolic and diastolic diameters at each
   location (all P < 0.001). Average aortic pulsatility was 1.5 +/- 0.6 mm
   at P1, 1.6 +/- 0.7 mm at P2, and 1.7 +/- 0.7 mm at P3, with a
   corresponding aortic strain of 6.7 +/- 3.1\% at P1, 7.4 +/- 3.5\% at P2,
   and 8.1 +/- 3.6\% at P3. The differences between the strain of the
   measurement levels were not significant (P = 0.344). Aortic strain and
   pulsatility did not show significant correlation with pulse pressure (P
   = 0.693), patient age (P = 0.649), or other anamnestic data. Intraclass
   correlation coefficient was in the range of 0.95-0.96 for interobserver
   and in the range of 0.95-0.97 for intra-observer analysis.
   Conclusions: This study shows that descending aortic strain can be
   measured precisely and reliably on images of routine CCTA examinations
   with native scans acquired during systole. We demonstrated that young
   adults have an aortic strain of 6.7-8.1\%. As the average thoracic
   aortic strain was still lower than the recommended prosthesis oversize
   of 10\%, routine use of systolic phase imaging cannot be recommended: it
   has no clinical benefit for the vast majority of the patients but
   increases the risk of motion artefacts. We also demonstrated that large
   interindividual differences are present in the scale of thoracic aortic
   strain, a phenomenon that needs further investigations to be fully
   understood.}},

   constructed 8 experimental populations. Half of the populations were
   disturbed between 2 observation periods. Two individual network metrics
   (strength and betweenness) were significantly repeatable across time in
   all treatments; a third (clustering coefficient) was not. At the network
   level, all 3 metrics changed more in undisturbed than disturbed

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis for behavioral

   during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between
   activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence
   in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile
   crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development,
   throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified
   open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3
   weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or
   response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the
   2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence
   was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet
   versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their
   response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting
   negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our
   results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are
   not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic
   link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and
   that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent
   behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our

   environment experienced early in life can influence how individuals
   negotiate behavioral and life-history trade-offs later in life.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate whether pain catastrophizing and personality

   Subjects and Setting. Fifty-six undergraduates ( 14 males) recruited
   from the University of Peradeniya (mean age 21.7 +/- 0.8 SD years).
   Design and Methods. Participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing
   Scale and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. They were subjected to
   two cold pressor tests (dominant and non-dominant hands) and pain
   threshold, maximum pain intensity, and pain tolerance were recorded.
   One-week later, the maximum pain intensities of both hands were recalled
   and percentage distortions in recalling were calculated. Based on a 180
   s cutoff, two participants were considered pain-insensitive during the
   test and were excluded from the analysis.
   Results. The maximum pain intensity was recalled with a moderate
   accuracy (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients = 0.68 for dominant and
   0.59 for non-dominant hands). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses
   revealed that maximum pain intensity (P < 0.001) and pain
   catastrophizing (P < 0.001) contributed significantly to recalled pain
   intensity, and only pain catastrophizing contributed significantly (P <

   catastrophizing biased pain recall, whereas among personality traits

Abstract = {{In human psychological research, personality traits as well as cognitive
   traits are usually validated for both, their stability over time and
   contexts. While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically
   fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to
   reveal linkages or trade - offs. In animals, these validations have
   widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested
   guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique
   pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in
   each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality
   traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The
   animals did not learn to ``always choose the larger item{''} in the
   cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each
   stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four
   slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was
   significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A
   stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and
   learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a
   correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be
   connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are
   both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will
   hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive
   traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the
   interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel
   which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence
   improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual
   differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases
   when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in
   both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if
   particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate,
   skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We
   presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions,
   with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body
   condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to
   explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific,
   predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test
   sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions,
   yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition.
   Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in
   early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or
   females. While participation among males in high body condition was
   consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females,
   regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later,
   rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable
   behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that
   the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects
   entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely
   available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different
   personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that
   were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more
   likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in
   the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available
   meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to
   participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex,
   body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the
   testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or
   not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling
   biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in
   cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual
   differences in cognition difficult to interpret. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Developing cognitive tasks to reliably quantify individual differences
   in cognitive ability is critical to advance our understanding of the
   fitness consequences of cognition in the wild. Several factors may
   influence individual performance in a cognitive task, with some being
   unrelated to the cognitive ability that is the target of the test. It is
   therefore essential to assess how extraneous factors may affect task
   performance, particularly for those tasks that are frequently used to
   quantify individual differences in cognitive ability. The current study
   therefore measured the performance of wild North Island robins in two
   tasks commonly used to measure individual differences in avian
   cognition: a novel motor task and a detour reaching task. The robins'
   performance in the motor task was affected by prior experience;
   individuals that had previously participated in a similar task that
   required a different motor action pattern outperformed naive subjects.
   By contrast, detour reaching performance was influenced by an
   individual's body condition, suggesting that energetic state may affect
   inhibitory control in robins. Designing tasks that limit the influence
   of past experience and developing means of standardising motivation

Abstract = {{Several studies report a correlation between exploratory behaviour and

   learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in
   contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information
   available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of
   exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine
   the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to
   examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality.
   Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess
   repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to
   discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90 degrees
   (vertical, the S+) and 135 degrees (the S-). After training pigeons
   underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line
   orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to
   generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization
   gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the
   direction towards the S-. These results suggest that birds with
   different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned
   information. Further testing is needed to confirm which cue(s) (S+ or

   personality and cognition is growing, no study to date investigated
   whether a cognitive bias might be related to the personality of the

   discriminate between two sides of a test cage, each side being
   associated with a different value (attractive or aversive food in a
   dish). During the test phase, the dish was placed at intermediate
   locations, representing ambiguous information. Results show evidence of
   an ``optimistic{''} bias (flying faster to the dish at the ambiguous
   location) in birds housed in pairs, compared to birds housed singly,
   suggesting an influence of social context (living conditions) on
   canaries' emotions when tested individually. We also studied six traits

Abstract = {{Conservation efforts should consider many aspects of the endangered
   species' life history and behavioral ecology. Additionally, when
   multiple endangered species interact, those relationships must also be
   considered when exploring recovery plans for either or both species. In
   our continued efforts to conserve the critically endangered Leon Springs
   pupfish (Cyprinodon bovinus), we explored consistency in aggression
   toward the endangered sympatric Pecos gambusia (Gambusia nobilis), that
   attempt to prey upon pupfish eggs during spawnings. We repeatedly
   observed 13 territorial male pupfish and measured individual aggression,
   focusing on defensive chases against gambusia and interactions with
   other pupfish. Short-distance chases at gambusia and chases of
   territorial neighbors were significantly repeatable, indicating that
   pupfish show behavioral consistency, or personality. Moreover, male
   pupfish that gave more short chases to gambusia experienced higher
   spawning success. Together, these data suggest that personality can
   predict reproductive success and thus should be considered by managers
   working to conserve endangered populations. Conservationists should take
   into consideration that differential reproductive success may certainly
   be relevant to the recovery of at-risk species.}},

Abstract = {{Across a range of taxa, individuals within a species differ in suites of

   dramatic evolutionary consequences as they do not evolve independently

   relating to aspects of behavior and life history. What is less clear is
   whether physiological traits also form a syndrome. We measured 10
   thermal traits in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to test
   this idea. Repeatability was calculated and their across-context
   correlations evaluated. Our results were in alignment with our
   predictions in that individual thermal traits varied consistently and
   were structured into a physiological syndrome, which we are referring to
   as the thermal behavior syndrome (TBS). Within this syndrome, lizards
   exhibited a ``thermal type{''} with each being ranked along a cold-hot
   continuum. Hot types had faster sprint speeds and higher preferred body
   temperatures, whereas the opposite was true for cold types. We conclude
   that physiological traits may evolve as a single unit driven by the need
   to maintain optimal temperatures that enable fitness-related behaviors

Abstract = {{Using long-term maternal pedigree data, microsatellite analysis, and
   behavioral tests, we examined whether personality differences in wild
   Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) are associated with additive genetic
   effects, maternal influences, or belonging to a particular social group.
   Behaviors elicited by novel-object tests were defined by a component
   related to caution around novel-objects (Ob-PC1) and behaviors elicited
   by novel food-tests were defined by correlated components related to
   consummatory responses (Fo-PC1) and caution around novel foods (Fo-PC2).
   The repeatability of Ob-PC1 was modest and not significant; the
   repeatabilities of Fo-PC1 and Fo-PC2 were moderate and significant.
   Linear mixed effects models found that sex, age, sex x age,
   provisioning, trial number, date, time of day, season, and distance to
   the closest monkey were not related to personality. Linear mixed effects
   models of females older than 2 years found that high rank was associated
   with greater caution around novel objects. Linear models were used to
   determine whether sex, age, group membership, maternal kinship, or
   relatedness had independent effects on the personality similarity of
   dyads. These analyses found that pairs of macaques that lived in the
   same group were less similar in their caution around novel objects, more
   closely related pairs of macaques were more similar in their tendency to
   eat novel food, and that pairs of macaques in the same group were more
   similar in how cautious they were around novel foods. Together, these
   findings suggest that personality in this population of wild monkeys was
   driven by rank, genetic effects, and group effects, the latter possibly
   including the need to exploit different niches in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory measures of personality traits are often used to answer both
   evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations
   in the wild within and between populations. However, little is known
   about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with
   behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different
   context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour
   trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the
   activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different
   exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two
   different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test
   and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight
   large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of
   individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration.
   We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in
   activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found
   no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not
   capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or

   constituting a general exploration strategy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Animal personality studies rely on collecting repeated behavioural data
   either in the field or under laboratory conditions. Conditions in the
   field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions,
   and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here
   we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally
   compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and
   the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a
   design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of
   sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the
   field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We
   analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including
   repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components.
   Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory
   and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across
   situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods
   of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this
   effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to
   laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was
   stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those
   that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that
   although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results
   like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of
   consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction
   between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals
   are observed. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{339-348}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits and behavioural syndromes are often assumed to relate
   to life history strategies and lifetime fitness variation and hence may
   be generally under selection. Key in this regard is the, often untested,
   assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are
   maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we
   tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly
   assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of
   sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts
   (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a
   substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless
   of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and
   sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across
   seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability
   estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for
   significant between-individual correlations between the investigated
   traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our
   results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are
   personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term
   but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that
   personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study
   might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This
   long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have
   important implications for the social organization within complex social
   environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant
   processes. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Sexual conflict over mating rate often implies that males persist at
   frequently harassing females to gain matings while females resist mating
   attempts. In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous
   pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of
   resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female
   resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used
   Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and
   the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance
   traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable
   and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past
   mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between
   these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment
   and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly
   repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured
   harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment
   and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide
   off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict
   intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding
   frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment
   endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is
   more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles.
   Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm
   that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic
   female resistance.}},

   study utilized empirically supported extraction criteria (parallel
   analysis; minimum average partial procedure) and uniformly investigated
   5 samples. RBANS data from 4 previously published studies (Carlozzi,
   Horner, Yang, \& Tilley, 2008; Duff, Hobson, Beglinger, \& O'Bryant,

   Center. The congruence of factor structures was investigated by
   conducting orthogonal vector matrix comparisons (Barrett, 2005), and a
   robust 2-factor structure reliably emerged across samples. The invariant
   RBANS 2-factor structure primarily emphasized memory and visuospatial
   functioning. This finding offered further support for a 2-factor RBANS
   structure identified in previous studies and additionally provided
   empirical documentation of replication across diverse samples. Due to
   the expansive use of the RBANS, this psychometric knowledge has

   for the hypoxia avoidance test (h(2) = 0.19 +/- 0.10). The genetic
   correlations between the three risk-taking scores were very high (r(A) =
   0.96-0.99) showing that although their repeatability was moderately high

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', defined as repeatable inter-individual differences
   in behaviour, is a concept in biology that faces intense controversy.
   Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and
   methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework.
   Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying
   individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences
   in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this
   trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of
   estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the
   inter-and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing
   parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we
   outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to
   describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second,
   we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help
   researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory
   power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological
   traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and
   present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while
   measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its
   own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural
   selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in
   complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural
   traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural
   differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology,
   endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g.
   selection gradients, heritability).}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, investigators have documented individual
   differences in many different types of behavioral plasticity. Of
   particular interest are individual differences in the temporal
   plasticity of personality traits over extended (ontogenetic) periods of
   time, because of the relevance of these data to models of behavioral
   development. We discuss recent empirical studies of the temporal
   consistency of personality over ontogeny, and models that make
   contrasting predictions about individual differences in the
   developmental trajectories of behavioral traits. In addition, we
   consider recent advances in studies of relationships between personality
   traits and particular types of behavioral plasticity, including
   statistical methods which facilitate analyses of relationships between
   personality traits, contextual plasticity, temporal plasticity and
   intraindividual variability, and empirical tests of predicted
   relationships between personality traits and other types of behavioral
   plasticity (flexibility, learning rates). As the field of animal
   personality and behavioral plasticity moves from a largely descriptive
   to a predictive phase, we suggest that there is ample room for empirical
   tests of recent models that predict individual differences in behavioral
   developmental trajectories, and for the development of new formal models
   that make strong predictions about relationships between personality
   traits and specific types of behavioral plasticity.}},

Title = {{Predicting individual contrast sensitivity functions from acuity and
   letter contrast sensitivity measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Contrast sensitivity (CS) is widely used as a measure of visual function
   in both basic research and clinical evaluation. There is conflicting
   evidence on the extent to which measuring the full contrast sensitivity
   function (CSF) offers more functionally relevant information than a
   single measurement from an optotype CS test, such as the Pelli-Robson
   chart. Here we examine the relationship between functional CSF
   parameters and other measures of visual function, and establish a
   framework for predicting individual CSFs with effectively a
   zero-parameter model that shifts a standard-shaped template CSF
   horizontally and vertically according to independent measurements of
   high contrast acuity and letter CS, respectively. This method was
   evaluated for three different CSF tests: a chart test (CSV-1000), a
   computerized sine-wave test (M\&S Sine Test), and a recently developed
   adaptive test (quick CSF). Subjects were 43 individuals with healthy
   vision or impairment too mild to be considered low vision (acuity range
   of -0.3 to 0.34 logMAR). While each test demands a slightly different
   normative template, results show that individual subject CSFs can be
   predicted with roughly the same precision as test-retest repeatability,
   confirming that individuals predominantly differ in terms of peak CS and
   peak spatial frequency. In fact, these parameters were sufficiently
   related to empirical measurements of acuity and letter CS to permit
   accurate estimation of the entire CSF of any individual with a
   deterministic model (zero free parameters). These results demonstrate
   that in many cases, measuring the full CSF may provide little additional
   information beyond letter acuity and contrast sensitivity.}},

Journal = {{NUTRIENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Experimental studies have shown that sleep restriction (SR) and total
   sleep deprivation (TSD) produce increased caloric intake, greater fat
   consumption, and increased late-night eating. However, whether
   individuals show similar energy intake responses to both SR and TSD
   remains unknown. A total of N = 66 healthy adults (aged 21-50 years,
   48.5\% women, 72.7\% African American) participated in a within-subjects
   laboratory protocol to compare daily and late-night intake between one
   night of SR (4 h time in bed, 04:00-08:00) and one night of TSD (0 h
   time in bed) conditions. We also examined intake responses during
   subsequent recovery from SR or TSD and investigated gender differences.
   Caloric and macronutrient intake during the day following SR and TSD
   were moderately to substantially consistent within individuals
   (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients:0.34-0.75). During the late-night
   period of SR (22:00-04:00) and TSD (22:00-06:00), such consistency was
   slight to moderate, and participants consumed a greater percentage of
   calories from protein (p = 0.01) and saturated fat (p = 0.02) during SR,
   despite comparable caloric intake (p = 0.12). Similarly, participants
   consumed a greater percentage of calories from saturated fat during the
   day following SR than TSD (p = 0.03). Participants also consumed a
   greater percentage of calories from protein during recovery after TSD (p
   < 0.001). Caloric intake was greater in men during late-night hours and
   the day following sleep loss. This is the first evidence of phenotypic
   trait-like stability and differential vulnerability of energy balance
   responses to two commonly experienced types of sleep loss:our findings
   open the door for biomarker discovery and countermeasure development to
   predict and mitigate this critical health-related vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Dominance hierarchies characterize social groups of various species and
   can significantly influence individual fitness. Personality traits,
   consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been
   proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies
   so far have investigated the link between personality traits and
   dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the
   relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked
   to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object
   neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees,
   Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in
   flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that
   if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups,
   dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic
   than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped
   chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of
   linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were
   significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that
   they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that
   proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the
   establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We
   discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual
   attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance
   hierarchies found in nature. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Investigating how environmental factors influence within-species trait
   variability is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance
   of individual behavioural differences (i.e. temperament or personality),
   and their integration into wider ecological theory. Populations of
   Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly
   contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to
   investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits.
   Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel
   environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory
   conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for
   repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between
   populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel
   environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and
   inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable
   behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of
   boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex,
   while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This
   suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently
   according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that
   fish caught from environments without predators and with probable
   intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel
   food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat
   differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes,
   relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable
   insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we
   define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of
   studying temperament within a community ecology context. (C) 2016 The

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase (sAA), secretory IgA (sIgA),
   testosterone, and soluble fraction of receptor II of TNF alpha (sTNF
   alpha RII) could serve as objective pain measures, but the normal
   variability of these potential biomarkers is unknown.
   Patients \& Methods
   Saliva was collected with the passive secretion method from 34,
   pain-free subjects in two single samples at least 24 hours apart.
   Biomarker variation and intersession reliability were assessed with the
   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Also, we calculated the
   within-subject standard deviation (S-w) and the reproducibility (2.77 x
   S-w) of intersession measures.
   Results
   Salivary cortisol, sAA, sIgA, testosterone, and sTNF alpha RII yielded
   the following ICCs: 0.53, 0.003, 0.88, 0.42 and 0.83, respectively. We
   found no statistically significant systematic differences between
   sessions in any biomarker except for testosterone, which showed a
   decrease on the second day (p<0.001). The reproducibility for salivary
   cortisol, sAA, sIgA, testosterone, and sTNF alpha RII were 0.46 ng/ml,
   12.88 U/ml, 11.7 mu g/ml, 14.54 pg/ml and 18.29 pg/ml, respectively.
   Cortisol, testosterone and TNF alpha RII measurement variability showed
   a positive correlation with the magnitude (p<0.002), but no relationship
   was found for sAA and sIgA.
   Conclusions
   Salivary sIgA and sTNF alpha RII show a remarkable good reproducibility
   and, therefore, could be useful as pain biomarkers. When using the
   passive secretion method, intersession variations in salivary sIgA of
   more than 11.7 mu g/ml may reflect true biomarker change. In the case of
   sTNF alpha RII this will depend of the magnitude. The estimates herein
   provided should help investigators and clinicians differentiate actual
   biomarker modification from measurement variability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Animal personality is defined as the repeatable between-individual
   differences in behaviour over time and contexts. Some personality
   traits, such as activity or aggression, have received much attention

   been neglected.
   2. Wormlion larvae are sit-and-wait dipteran predators that inhabit
   shaded microhabitats in the field and also prefer shade in the
   laboratory. The aim of the present study was to examine wormlion larvae
   behavioural repeatability in general and specifically in the context of
   habitat preference. In order to achieve this, three experiments were
   conducted to determine whether, to what extent and under which
   conditions wormlion preference for shaded microhabitats is repeatable.
   3. Individual tendency to relocate when the environment conditions
   deteriorate was also assessed, by switching between shaded and
   illuminated conditions, either with or without pit destruction.
   4. Larvae showed a highly repeatable preference for shade. Repeatability
   was detected in additional behavioural traits: pit construction, pit
   area and tendency to relocate.
   5. This behavioural repeatability was demonstrated under constant
   microhabitat conditions, with distinct behaviours in each setting. Under
   constant illumination, wormlions constructed smaller pits, moved over
   longer distances and were found at the tray edges more frequently than
   under constant shade conditions, suggesting that illuminated
   environments are perceived as risky or unsuitable.
   6. Switching between the two microhabitat conditions without pit
   destruction induced fewer relocations than switching with pit
   destruction, suggesting that wormlions do not tend to abandon their
   pits, even if their microhabitat conditions deteriorate.}},

Abstract = {{Animals typically display among-individual differences in behavior that
   are consistent over time (i.e., personality). These differences are
   often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress
   factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and
   risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are
   considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown
   whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main
   sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested
   whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of
   Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific
   competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic
   and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences
   in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was
   manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile
   individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The
   emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral
   plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior
   among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal
   personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under
   laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors
   that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of
   behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for
   the development of personality in animals.
   Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is,
   individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold
   and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences
   among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often
   caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this
   study, we observed that personality differences were not present at
   juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the
   fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition
   for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences
   strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual
   behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that the decline in
   behavioral plasticity with age may represent a relevant mechanism for
   behavioral differentiation in animals, in agreement with evidences from
   the human literature on age-related loss in behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state
   (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation
   to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of
   starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta
   adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size
   during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is
   important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days,
   respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different
   combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL;
   first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively).
   Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the
   treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \%
   more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large
   within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for
   this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more
   actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration.
   Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being
   more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were
   positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied
   population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish
   two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive
   individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive
   individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct
   behavioral strategies early in life.
   This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in
   animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data
   suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is
   increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a
   limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On
   the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression,
   likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance.
   The experiment was carried out during the main population survival
   bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during
   this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited,
   and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our
   data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters,
   based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are
   positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and
   aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral
   strategy.}},

   whether individuals with paraphilia diagnoses have cognitive deficits
   compared with the general population; (b) whether individuals diagnosed
   with pedophilia differed on cognitive performance when compared with
   individuals diagnosed with paraphilia not otherwise specified (NOS),

   personality disorder (ASPD) differed in cognitive performance when
   compared with individuals with a paraphilia diagnosis only. The sample
   consisted of 170 males (M age = 50.21; SD = 10.22) diagnosed with
   pedophilia or paraphilia NOS, nonconsent, who were detained or civilly
   committed to a forensic psychiatric hospital. Assessments included

   Individuals diagnosed with a paraphilia disorder combined with ASPD

Abstract = {{Oxytocin is a hormone that may not only influence reproductive
   mechanisms in mammals but also their social behavior, including pair
   bonding. We therefore tested if the concentrations of oxytocin and other
   hormones reveal mate preferences of 13 mares in estrus. Each mare was
   first exposed to two stallions (haphazardly selected out of seven) and
   her behavior recorded. The mare was then returned to her box (i.e., no
   contact to stallions during that time). Approximately 4.5 hours later,
   venous blood samples were collected every minute during 30 minutes
   preceding exposure to one of the two previously used stallions, 6
   minutes during exposure, and 30 minutes after exposure back in the
   mare's box. The procedure was repeated in the consecutive estrus cycle,
   with the difference that the mare was each exposed to the other of the
   two stallions during oxytocin measurements. In 20 of the 26 trials,
   oxytocin concentrations were significantly elevated during exposure to
   the stallion, without significant associations to cortisol and estradiol
   concentrations. We found no significant association between oxytocin
   secretion and preferences in the previous choice situation. While
   estradiol concentration showed a high repeatability over the two cycles,
   we found considerable intraindividual differences in oxytocin and
   cortisol plasma concentration among the two cycles. Partially, the
   variation in oxytocin concentrations could be linked to the time of
   ovulation, with lower oxytocin plasma concentrations in mares which
   ovulated later than expected. In conclusion, when teasing under
   experimental conditions, we found high interindividual and
   intraindividual variation among mares in the increase of oxytocin plasma
   concentrations, depending on the timing of ovulation. However, oxytocin
   levels seemed to be no predictor of mare preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation
   significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent

Abstract = {{Architectural constructions allow animals to modify their environment in

   the expression of individual behavior, ultimately affecting the presence
   and importance of animal personality within populations. The exact
   impact of constructions on personality is seldom investigated. We
   quantified experimentally the impact of web characteristics on
   individual foraging behavior in the Western black widow spider
   (Latrodectus hesperus). We assayed aggressiveness toward a prey cue, and
   boldness while individuals resided on their own web versus after being
   translocated onto webs built by conspecifics. We quantified the
   importance of individual differences in aggressiveness and boldness
   while accounting for differences in web characteristics. We tested for
   relationships between web building, aggressiveness, and boldness. Web
   characteristics affected spider aggressiveness and interacted with
   individual web-building behavior to explain up to a fifth of the
   variation in foraging aggression, but did not affect spider boldness.
   Even after accounting for web characteristics, individuals still
   exhibited important differences in aggressiveness. We detected no
   relationship between an individual's aggressiveness behavioral type and
   the characteristics of the web it built. Surprisingly, web
   characteristics impacted aggressiveness differently from one individual
   to the next. Hence the effect of web characteristics on foraging
   behavior might depend on condition or past experience. Webs contributed
   mostly to the variation in aggressiveness within-individuals. Variation
   in web building behavior might affect the amount of consistent
   differences in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior among

Abstract = {{Resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) is a powerful in-vivo tool for examining the
   functional architecture of the human brain. Recent studies have
   demonstrated the ability to characterize transitions between
   functionally distinct cortical areas through the mapping of gradients in
   intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) profiles. To date, this novel
   approach has primarily been applied to iFC profiles averaged across
   groups of individuals, or in one case, a single individual scanned
   multiple times. Here, we used a publically available R-fMRI dataset, in
   which 30 healthy participants were scanned 10 times (10 min per
   session), to investigate differences in full-brain transition profiles
   (i.e., gradient maps, edge maps) across individuals, and their
   reliability. 10-min R-fMRI scans were sufficient to achieve high
   accuracies in efforts to ``fingerprint{''} individuals based upon
   full-brain transition profiles. Regarding test-retest reliability, the
   image-wise intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was moderate, and
   vertex-level ICC varied depending on region; larger durations of data
   yielded higher reliability scores universally. Initial application of
   gradient-based methodologies to a recently published dataset obtained
   from twins suggested inter-individual variation in areal profiles might
   have genetic and familial origins. Overall, these results illustrate the
   utility of gradient-based iFC approaches for studying inter-individual
   variation in brain function.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of laboratory animals is a prey in nature, therefore they
   can be used in the fields of many pshychological researches, such as
   modeling different human anxiety syndromes. Previously the rat used to
   be the primary model, but parellel to the development of molecular
   biology, sensitive transgenic mouse models appeared. To be able to
   effectively use these animals, the authors overview the natural
   behaviour of mice and their reaction in answering various situations.
   There are great differences amongst the phenotypes of the individual
   strains and lines, including behaviour and temperament, for example the
   CD1 mice are calm, the BALB/c ones rather irritate (Figure 1-3). In
   addition, during the experimentation a kind of environment should be
   assured mice to gratify their natural action catalogue, prevent
   influencing the results of the tests. The environmental enrichment
   influences animals' ethology, physiology and brain functions. The
   acoustic enrichment of the environment, namely the use of musical sound
   stimuli, became more and more preferred. A continuous background music
   may appease animals and decrease the stress of the constant, inevitable
   and abrupt noises. Moreover, it might have an effect on human, working
   with the animals and by this way may also influence the latter. The
   assumption is logical that the use of music might help to improve animal
   welfare and assure the standardisation and repeatability of experiments,
   as well as the reliability of the results. To achieve this, sufficient
   information is required about the musical preference of the most
   important experimental animal, the mouse and its strains: which type of
   music, in which hearing ranges and frequencies, applied in which
   circumstances are different or even harmful.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in the manner that they cope with risk. When these
   behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging
   environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted
   within the ``coping style{''} framework. As studying inter-individual
   variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used
   a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral
   response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using
   behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a
   calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second,
   explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a
   coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the
   stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of
   phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters
   were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual
   stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was
   considerable covariation among the stress response parameters,
   describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level.
   Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive
   individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy
   metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences
   in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food
   acquisition tactics and demographic performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The salmonid fish Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus shows pronounced
   individual variation in skin colouration and density of carotenoid-based
   spots. It has earlier been shown that spot density is a heritable trait,
   and may be used as an indicator of stress coping style in Arctic charr.
   Individuals with few spots tend to be more aggressive and less
   responsive to stress (proactive) than those with many spots (reactive).
   Here, we evaluate the potential of grading individuals into proactive
   and reactive individuals by the density of light-coloured spots. This
   non-invasive method would be useful for selective breeding and to reduce
   within-treatment variation in biological research. Our aim was to
   investigate stability of spot density over time and to compare methods
   to estimate spottiness on Arctic charr, using photographs as well as
   live fish. The consistency of spot density was significant over a period
   of 8months, but with stronger correlations between September and
   December than between May and September. Also, repeatability of spot
   number was higher between the two last months than when including May.
   The spots were more stable on the left than the right side, thus, it is
   more reliable to estimate spottiness on the left side. There was a
   significant relationship between the ratio of spotted area (rsa) from
   automated image analysis and number of spots from visual counts. Both
   methods fitted well into a visual grading into three categories (few,
   medium and many spots). In another test, a large number of live fish
   were visually categorized according to spot density. The previous
   validation process, in combination with a significant family effect
   showed that large numbers of fish can be effectively graded.}},

Pages = {{3-10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many animals show complex behaviours that can have important ecological
   and evolutionary consequences. Environmental variation can lead to
   divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in
   different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal
   behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions
   remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different
   levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable
   population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components
   of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and
   exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence
   for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish,
   Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled
   caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in
   either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish
   behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between
   predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability
   and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to
   high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex
   dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed
   reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did
   not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a
   behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive
   stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural
   syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar
   predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using
   laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that
   exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant
   within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental
   variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and
   often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that
   various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of
   one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours,
   the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Neophobia, or the fear of novelty, may offer benefits to animals by
   limiting their exposure to unknown danger, but can also impose costs by
   preventing the exploration of potential resources. The costs and
   benefits of neophobia may vary throughout the year if predation
   pressure, resource distribution or conspecific competition changes
   seasonally. Despite such variation, neophobia levels are often assumed
   to be temporally and individually stable. Whether or not neophobia
   expression changes seasonally and fluctuates equally for all individuals
   is crucial to understanding the drivers, consequences and plasticity of
   novelty avoidance. We investigated seasonal differences and individual
   consistency in the motivation and novelty responses of a captive group
   of rooks, Corvus frugilegus, a seasonally breeding, colonial species of
   corvid that is known for being neophobic. We tested the group around
   novel objects and novel people to determine whether responses
   generalized across novelty types, and considered whether differences in
   dominance could influence the social risk of approaching unknown
   stimuli. We found that the group's level of object neophobia was stable
   year-round, but individuals were not consistent between seasons, despite
   being consistent within seasons. In contrast, the group's avoidance of
   novel people decreased during the breeding season, and individuals were
   consistent year-round. Additionally, although subordinate birds were
   more likely to challenge dominants during the breeding season, this
   social risk taking did not translate to greater novelty approach. Since
   seasonal variation and individual consistency varied differently towards
   each novelty type, responses towards novel objects and people seem to be
   governed by different mechanisms. Such a degree of fluctuation has
   consequences for other individually consistent behaviours often measured
   within the nonhuman personality literature. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Landscape modification (loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat)
   is a universal form of human-induced rapid environmental change that
   creates strong spatial variation in environmental conditions.
   Behaviourally mediated responses to landscape modification may generate
   behavioural divergence among populations along environmental gradients.
   We tested whether movement behaviour of red-backed salamanders,
   Plethodon cinereus, is repeatable and whether it varies within and
   between forest stands of different ages in a fragmented landscape in New
   York, U.S.A. Water loss is a major constraint on P. cinereus mobility,
   and forest fragmentation creates spatial variation in desiccation risk.
   We quantified multiple components of individual movement behaviour in an
   unfamiliar environment in the laboratory and used ordination to identify
   behavioural variation among individuals in multivariate space. We tested
   for repeatability of individual behaviour and then examined behavioural
   differences between individuals captured from populations at two spatial
   scales where desiccation risk was expected to vary: (1) between edge and
   interior locations within forest stands and (2) between forest stands
   varying in time since agricultural abandonment. Variation in movement
   behaviour among individuals was characterized by three components: total
   movement activity (e.g. surface activity, distance moved, boundary
   crossings), substrate use (time on moist soil versus dry sand) and
   latency to initial movement. Each behavioural component was
   significantly repeatable. At the population level, individuals from old
   forest stands (>= 77 years) showed greater movement activity than
   individuals from young stands. Movement behaviour did not differ between
   individuals from edge and interior locations within forest stands. Our
   results demonstrate that P. cinereus individuals show consistent
   differences in movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment.
   Moreover, we show that movement behaviour can be spatially structured
   within fragmented landscapes, but that behavioural divergence among
   populations depends on spatial scale. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{While personality-dependent dispersal is well studied, local space use
   has received surprisingly little attention in this context, despite the
   multiple consequences on survival and fitness. Regarding the coping
   style of individuals, recent studies on personality-dependent space use
   within a habitat indicate that `proactive' individuals are wider ranging
   than `reactive' ones. However, such studies are still scarce and cover
   limited taxonomic diversity, and thus, more research is needed to
   explore whether this pattern generalises across species. We examined the
   link between coping style and space use in a population of crows (Corvus
   corone) freely inhabiting the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria. We used a
   binary docility rating (struggle during handling vs. no struggle) and a
   tonic immobility test to quantify individual coping style. Individual
   space use was quantified as the number of different sites at which each
   crow was observed, and we controlled for different number of sightings
   per individual by creating a space use index. Only the binary docility
   rating showed repeatability over time, and significantly predicted space
   use. In contrast to previous studies, we found that reactive crows (no
   struggle during handling) showed wider ranging space use within the
   study site than proactive individuals (who struggled during handling).
   The discrepancy from previous results suggests that the relationship
   between behavioural type and space use may vary between species,
   potentially reflecting differences in socioecology.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in state, which is any factor that alters the value of
   decision options, is likely one of the most common drivers of
   personality differences. However, the general relationship between
   individuals' body state and various personality metrics/average
   behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome
   structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition
   in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and
   Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then
   assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals' body
   condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed
   the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and
   aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these
   two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals'
   average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A.
   studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both
   boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A.
   studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing
   repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations
   between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one
   case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and
   the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our
   results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial
   effects on individuals' average personality type and the correlations
   between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust
   positive relationship between food availability and the signature of
   consistent individual differences in behavior.
   Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply
   decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider
   species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting
   that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher
   body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related
   behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found
   that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and
   boldness but not correlations between these traits. This work highlights
   the importance of state variables such as hunger in eroding behavioral
   repeatability, the defining trait of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how and why consistent behavioural traits (i.e. animal
   personality) vary between individuals, and identifying the mechanisms
   that underlie such variation, is a key focus in behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology. In many animals, male and female behaviour often
   diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history
   trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies
   spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring
   the very strong possibility that key components of personality,
   behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between
   males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important
   role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity
   of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying
   the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate
   skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female
   delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural
   traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that
   explains the delicate skink's successful invasion history via accidental
   introductions. We found that females were more social than males and
   showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the
   same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable
   and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were
   consistently more active explored environments faster and were more
   likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of
   sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both
   sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study
   highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in
   personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade.
   Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often
   face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual's
   personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel
   environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females
   in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about
   the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion
   history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend
   towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive
   correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour
   suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome. Our
   results suggest limited behavioural variation between the sexes and that
   both sexes may have an equal invasion potential.}},

Abstract = {{Among-individual differences in behavior are now a widely studied
   research focus within the field of behavioral ecology. Furthermore,
   elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves,
   and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this,
   we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of
   behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a
   particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely
   activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make
   behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure
   to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the
   mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e.,
   variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer.
   We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral
   expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral
   variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove
   large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of
   repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a
   novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel
   environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham
   injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences.
   Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and
   repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that
   individuals face throughout their lives.
   Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in
   behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals
   are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it
   is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure
   to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated
   how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean
   behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results
   show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual
   differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose
   oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel
   environment). These results highlight the sensitivity of behavioral
   differences to elements of state, such as infection status.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Visual-world eyetracking is increasingly used to investigate
   online language processing in normal and language impaired listeners.
   Tracking changes in eye movements over time also may be useful for
   indexing language recovery in those with language impairments.
   Therefore, it is critical to determine the test-retest reliability of
   results obtained using this method.
   Methods: Unimpaired young adults and people with aphasia took part in
   two eyetracking sessions spaced about one week apart. In each session,
   participants completed a sentence picture matching task in which they
   listened to active and passive sentences (e.g., The {[}(N1+Aux) woman
   was] {[}(V) visiting/visited] {[}(NP/PP2) (by) the man]) and selected
   between two pictures with reversed thematic roles. We used intraclass
   correlations (ICCs) to examine the test-retest reliability of response
   measures (accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and online eye movements (i.e.,
   the likelihood of fixating the target picture in each region of the
   sentence) in each participant group.
   Results: In the unimpaired adults, accuracy was at ceiling (thus ICCs
   were not computed), with moderate ICCs for RT (i.e., 0.4-0.58) for
   passive sentences and low (<0.4) for actives. In individuals with
   aphasia, test-retest reliability was strong (0.59 < ICC < 0.75) for
   accuracy and excellent (>0.75) for RT for both sentence types.
   Similarly, for the unimpaired listeners, reliability of eye movements
   was moderate for passive sentences (NP/PP2 region) and low in all
   regions for active sentences. But, for the aphasic participant group,
   eye movement reliability was excellent for passive sentences (in the
   first second after sentence end) and strong for active sentences (V and
   NP/PP2 regions).
   Conclusion: Results indicated moderate-to-low reliability for unimpaired
   listeners; however, reliable eye movement patterns were detected for
   processes specific to passive sentences (e.g., thematic reanalysis). In
   contrast, individuals with aphasia exhibited strong and stable
   performance across sentence types in response measures and online eye
   movements. These findings indicate that visual-world eyetracking
   provides a reliable measure of online sentence comprehension in aphasia,
   and thus may be useful for investigating sentence processing changes
   over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hormones are fundamental mediators of personality traits intimately
   linked with reproductive success. Hence, alterations to endocrine
   factors may dramatically affect individual behavior that has subsequent
   fitness consequences. Yet it is unclear how hormonal or behavioral
   traits change with environmental stressors or over multiple reproductive
   opportunities, particularly for biparental fauna. To simulate an
   environmental stressor, we exposed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs
   to novel coyote odor attractants (i.e. commercial scent lures) mid
   gestation to influence territorial behaviors, fecal glucocorticoid
   (FGMs) and fecal androgen metabolites (FAMs). In addition, we observed
   coyote pairs as first-time and experienced breeders to assess the
   influence of parity on our measures. Treatment pairs received the odors
   four times over a 20-day period, while control pairs received water.
   Odor-treated pairs scent-marked (e.g. urinated, ground scratched) and
   investigated odors more frequently than control pairs, and had higher
   FAMs when odors were provided. Pairs had higher FAMs as first-time
   versus experienced breeders, indicating that parity also affected
   androgen production during gestation. Moreover, repeatability in
   scent-marking behaviors corresponded with FGMs and FAMs, implying that
   coyote territoriality during gestation is underpinned by
   individually-specific hormone profiles. Our results suggest coyote
   androgens during gestation are sensitive to conspecific olfactory
   stimuli and prior breeding experience. Consequently, fluctuations in
   social or other environmental stimuli as well as increasing parity may
   acutely affect coyote traits essential to reproductive success. (C) 2016

   and post-stress cortisol concentrations respectively. Finally, the liver
   transcription profiles of LR and HR fish showed some important

Abstract = {{There is a long-standing interest in behavioural ecology, exploring the

   methodological implications to the study of trait variation in labile
   traits, such as behaviour and physiology, though we currently need
   studies to quantify variation in rIIV, using more standardized and
   powerful methodology. Focusing on activity rates in guppies (Poecilia
   reticulata), we provide a model example, from sampling design to data
   analysis, in how to quantify rIIV in labile traits. Building on the
   doubly hierarchical generalized linear model recently used to quantify
   individual differences in rIIV, we extend the model to evaluate the
   covariance between individual mean values and their rIIV. After
   accounting for time-related change in behaviour, our guppies
   substantially differed in rIIV, and it was the active individuals that
   tended to be more consistent (lower rIIV). We provide annotated data

Abstract = {{Anti-predator behaviour of breeding animals is a complex trait that
   depends on current reproductive investment as well as individual
   differences in risk-taking propensities. In response to nest predation,
   many bird species produce specific sounds, such as the hissing calls in
   incubating great tits (Parus major), that may provoke an acoustic
   startle response in the predator. However, it is still unclear whether
   the propensity of incubating females to produce hissing calls towards
   nest predators depends on the reproductive investment. With our 3-year
   study, we show that response type (females that do not hiss versus
   females giving hissing calls) to a potential nest predator, the
   woodpecker, is a repeatable trait. We found no differences in the
   studied reproductive traits between hissing and non-hissing birds.
   Interestingly, among hissing birds, fast-responding females started
   egg-laying earlier than slow-responding ones. Among non-hissing birds,
   heavier birds initiated clutches earlier. We also revealed that hissing
   birds breed in areas with decreased nest-box occupancy, suggesting
   either that they potentially select different areas to breed or that
   territory size is larger as a result of hissing birds being more
   aggressive. These findings demonstrate that response type is not related
   to the early reproductive value of the brood across distinct behavioural
   groups. However, our results do suggest that non-hissing and hissing

Abstract = {{Empathy is an important psychological concept influencing social
   interaction. However, knowledge about its etiological components is
   still scarce. Estimates for the heritability of empathy range between 0
   and 70 \% depending on the sample, method of measurement, and level of
   aggregation. In this study, we investigated the heritability of empathy
   using an extended twin design. We employed the self-report questionnaire
   Interpersonal Reactivity Index and an emotion recognition task (Reading
   the Mind in the Eyes Test). N = 742 twins and non-twin siblings were
   investigated. For affective empathy and the behavioral paradigm, we
   found heritability estimates between 52 and 57 \%. For cognitive
   empathy, genetic variance was smaller (27 \%), indicating that the
   heritability of empathy depends on the measured subcomponent, which
   could be relevant for intervention programs like empathy or compassion
   trainings. Environmental influences on empathy are mainly effects of
   non-shared environment, which is an important finding for our
   understanding of the development of empathy.}},

Title = {{Do great tits (Parus major) suppress basal metabolic rate in response to
   increased perceived predation danger? A field experiment}},

Volume = {{164}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that individuals with higher metabolic rates
   (MRs) feed at higher rates and are more willing to forage in the
   presence of predators. This increases the acquisition of resources,
   which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation
   danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of
   allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of
   adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking.
   We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using
   a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There
   was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of
   treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce
   their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased
   predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed
   no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits
   from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR)
   over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient
   temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for
   changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the
   directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions
   of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield
   inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively
   suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The
   effect size observed in the present study was small (similar to 1\%) and
   would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding
   rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that
   generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower
   ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically
   meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an
   open question. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{treating a proportion of animals in the population. One way to select
   animals for treatment is to identify low and high egg-shedders using
   faecal egg counts (FEC); then to treat only the high egg-shedders. The
   value of this method is enhanced if differences among individuals in the
   level of egg-shedding remain consistent over time. One way to assess the
   stability of the rankings of animals over time is to measure the
   repeatability which is defined as the variance between horses divided by
   the total variance. The repeatability varies between 0 (no consistency
   in the values) to 1 (perfect consistency). To determine the
   repeatability of egg-shedding in naturally infected horses over time,
   2637 FEC and raw egg counts (REC; i.e. originally counted eggs without
   multiplication factor) from 303 horses were analysed. The distribution
   of FEC was more overdispersed than a Poisson distribution. Therefore, a
   negative-binomial model was used. The within-horse-repeatability of RECs
   was 0.52. In a second analysis, we excluded horses that were treated
   with anthelmintic drugs during the study by eliminating all REC within
   the egg-reappearance period. Here, the within-horse-repeatability was
   very similar at 0.53. The results show that egg-shedding of individual
   horses stays fairly consistent over time. They also show that animals
   which shed relatively high numbers of nematode eggs can be identified

Abstract = {{Background: After traumatic events, social support and posttraumatic
   stress are interrelated, but little is known about the underlying
   dynamics behind this association. Levels of social support and
   posttraumatic stress may change and affect each other over time, but
   there are also stable time-invariant individual differences in both
   constructs. The present study aimed to determine the amount of variance
   explained by stable individual differences in levels of social support
   and posttraumatic stress across three years, and to determine whether
   and to what extent social support and posttraumatic stress may affect
   one another when these stable individual differences are controlled for.
   Methods: We used data from ministerial employees present in the
   Governmental district during the 2011 Oslo bombing attack (N=255). Data
   was collected ten months, two years, and three years after the terror
   attack. Using a random intercept cross lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we
   tested the possible directional effects between social support and
   posttraumatic stress within persons when variance between persons was
   taken into account.
   Results: The intraclass correlations of the three measures of
   posttraumatic stress and social support were.83 and.74, respectively.
   The remaining variation within persons could not be explained by change
   in either of these constructs. Limitation: We have no information on the
   processes that might have occurred before 10 months after the incident.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the long-term longitudinal
   linkage between social support and posttraumatic stress may be best
   explained by stable individual differences rather than causal processes

Abstract = {{CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Personal resilience is associated with several

   is a widely used self-report measurement of resilience. This study aimed
   to investigate the reliability and validity of a Brazilian Portuguese
   version of the CD-RISC.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional validation study carried out in the
   outpatient clinics of a public university hospital.
   METHODS: The cross-cultural adaptation followed established guidelines
   and involved interviews with 65 adults in psychiatric and
   non-psychiatric outpatient clinics at a teaching hospital. Validation
   was assessed through concurrent application of the Lipp Brazilian Stress
   Symptom Inventory (ISSL), Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ), Sheehan
   Disability Scales (SDS) and Chronic Pain Grade (CPG) to 575 patients at
   the same setting. Temporal stability was verified through a second
   application to 123 participants.
   RESULTS: Factor analysis identified four factors, named tenacity,
   adaptability-tolerance, reliance on support from outside and intuition.
   The alpha coefficient of 0.93 and intraclass correlation coefficient of
   0.84 indicated good internal consistency and temporal stability.
   Significant correlations between this version of the CD-RISC and the
   ISSL, SRQ, SDS and CPG were noted. The patients at the outpatient clinic
   for borderline personality had resilience scores that were significantly
   lower than those of the patients at the general anxiety or
   post-traumatic stress outpatient clinics.
   CONCLUSION: This Brazilian Portuguese version of the Connor-Davidson
   resilience scale exhibited adequate reliability and validity among a
   sample of Brazilian adult patients.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Whether individual behavior in social settings correlates with behavior
   when individuals are alone is a fundamental question in collective
   behavior. However, evidence for whether behavior correlates across
   asocial and social settings is mixed, and no study has linked observed
   trends with underlying mechanisms. Consistent differences between
   individuals in boldness, which describes willingness to accept reward
   over risk, are likely to be under strong selection pressure. By testing
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in a risky foraging
   task alone and repeatedly in shoals, we demonstrate that the expression
   of boldness in groups is context-specific. Whereas personality is
   repeatable in a low-risk behavior (leaving a refuge), the collectively
   made consensus decision to then cross the arena outweighs leadership by
   bolder individuals, explaining the suppression of personality in this
   context. However, despite this social coordination, bolder individuals
   were still more likely to feed. Habituation and satiation over repeated
   trials degrade the effect of personality on leaving the refuge and also
   whether crossing the arena is a collective decision. The suppression of
   personality in groups suggests that individual risk-taking tendency may
   rarely represent actual risk in social settings, with implications for
   the evolution and ecology of personality variation.}},

Abstract = {{Are fast decisions less likely to be accurate? We tested for a trade-off
   between speed and accuracy in foraging great tits. We found support for
   a speed-accuracy trade-off among-individuals but not within-individuals.
   These findings thereby imply that these patterns were level-specific,
   and caused by multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously. This study may
   be used to guide further empirical studies focusing on level-specificity
   of relationships between behavioral and cognitive traits.Animals often
   face a conflict between the speed and accuracy by which a decision is
   made. Decisions taken quickly might be relatively inaccurate, whereas
   decisions taken more slowly might be more accurate. Such
   ``speed-accuracy trade-offs{''} receive increasing attention in
   behavioral and cognitive sciences. Importantly, life-history theory
   predicts that trade-offs typically exist only at certain hierarchical
   levels, such as within rather than among individuals. We therefore
   examined within- and among-individual correlations in the speed and
   accuracy by which decisions are taken, using a foraging context in
   wild-caught great tits (Parus major) as a worked example. We find that
   great tits exhibit among-individual variation in speed-accuracy
   trade-offs: some individuals predictably made relatively slow but
   accurate decisions, whereas others were predictably faster but less
   accurate. We did not, however, find evidence for the trade-off at the
   within-individual level. These level-specific relationships imply that
   different mechanisms acted across levels. These findings highlight the
   need for future work on the integration of individual behavior and

Abstract = {{Despite the common knowledge about the individual character of human
   gait patterns and about their non-repeatability, little is known about
   their stability, their interactions and their changes over time.
   Variations of gait patterns are typically described as random deviations
   around a stable mean curve derived from groups, which appear due to
   noise or experimental insufficiencies. The purpose of this study is to
   examine the nature of intrinsic inter-session variability in more detail
   by proving separable characteristics of gait patterns between
   individuals as well as within individuals in repeated measurement
   sessions. Eight healthy subjects performed 15 gait trials at a
   self-selected speed on eight days within two weeks. For each trial, the
   time-continuous ground reaction forces and lower body kinematics were
   quantified. A total of 960 gait patterns were analysed by means of
   support vector machines and the coefficient of multiple correlation. The
   results emphasise the remarkable amount of individual characteristics in
   human gait. Support vector machines results showed an error-free
   assignment of gait patterns to the corresponding individual. Thus,
   differences in gait patterns between individuals seem to be persistent
   over two weeks. Within the range of individual gait patterns, day
   specific characteristics could be distinguished by classification rates
   of 97.3\% and 59.5\% for the eight-day classification of lower body
   joint angles and ground reaction forces, respectively. Hence, gait
   patterns can be assumed not to be constant over time and rather exhibit
   discernible daily changes within previously stated good repeatability.

Abstract = {{Recent empirical and conceptual papers have highlighted the potential
   for metabolism to act as a proximate mechanism for behavior that could
   explain animal personality (consistency over time). Under this
   hypothesis, individuals with consistently high levels of behavioral
   activity should also have high resting metabolic rate (RMR) as it can
   reflect capacity to process food and generate energy. We tested for the
   predicted positive covariance between RMR and three behaviors that
   differ in energy demands in 30 male guppies, using multivariate mixed
   models; we repeatedly measured their activity (10 times each), courtship
   displays (nine times), voracity (10 times), and metabolism (four-times).
   Resting metabolic rate (measured overnight in respirometry trials) did
   not consistently differ among males, whereas initial peak metabolism
   measured during those same trials (R=0.42), and all behaviors were
   repeatable (R=0.33-0.51). RMR declined over time suggesting habituation
   to the protocol, whereas peak metabolism did not. Initial peak
   metabolism was negatively correlated with courtship display intensity,
   and voracity was positively correlated with activity, but all other
   among-individual correlations were not significant. We conclude that RMR
   does not provide a proximate explanation for consistent individual
   differences in behavior in male guppies, and therefore the potential for
   independent evolution of these physiological and behavioral traits seems
   possible. Finally, we identify peak metabolism as a potential measure of
   the stress response to confinement, which highlights the value of
   considering various aspects of metabolic rates recording during
   respirometry trials.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, teacher's ratings, mother's ratings, and father's

   two independent samples (N = 381 and N = 406, respectively) of Italian
   school age children (age range: 6-12 years). Cronbach alpha values
   greater than 0.80 were observed for all CPTI scale scores based on
   teacher's ratings, mother's ratings, and father's ratings respectively.
   Although intraclass correlation values suggested poor parent-teacher
   agreement, robust weighted least square Confirmatory Factor Analyses
   (WLSMV CFAs) suggested that the three-factor model of the CPTI was
   consistently replicated as the best fitting model across all informants.
   Logistic regression analysis conducted in one of the samples showed that
   teacher's ratings and mother's ratings of the CPTI, but not CPTI
   father's ratings, significantly predicted child's problem behavior at
   school. Multiple regression analyses showed that CPTI scores were
   significantly predicted by selected temperament dimensions, but with
   different relationships for different sources of information. Overall,
   our findings suggest that the CPTI is a reliable and valid measure of

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that interindividual differences in the activity of brown
   trout alter the exposure to parasitic freshwater pearl mussel glochidia
   was tested in a Swedish stream. Wild yearling brown trout (N=103) were
   caught, individually tagged for identification and scored for open-field
   activity during standardized laboratory tests in June. Fifty gravid
   freshwater pearl mussels were relocated to the stream, where after the
   trout were released back into the stream. The fish were recaptured in
   October (N=35), checked for glochidia encystment (infested individuals:
   n=6) and re-scored for open-field activity traits. Swimming velocity
   during the test was higher in fish infected with glochidia, suggesting
   that high activity could increase their exposure to glochidia.
   Potentially, as metabolism rate and ventilation rate typically increase
   with activity, elevated activity may lead to an increased likelihood of
   glochidia passing over the gills. This novel finding suggests that
   glochidia infestation is non-random and that the behaviour of the host
   fish can influence the likelihood of glochidia infestation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The drivers of intraspecific variation in behavioral
   plasticity are poorly known. A widely held hypothesis is that brain size
   is positively correlated with behavioral plasticity.
   Methods: A total of 71 Chestnut Thrushes (Turdus rubrocanus) were caught
   in the wild population. We quantified behavior plasticity of activity of
   individuals measured in the same cage across two contexts (common and
   with a novel object stimulation), using a random regression analysis. We
   then investigated whether head volume (a proxy for brain size) was
   associated with behavioral plasticity in activity level using Spearman
   rank-order correlation.
   Results: We found no significant evidence that activity plasticity was
   associated with relative head volume. There was no sex difference in
   head volume or in variance in head volume.
   Conclusions: We speculate that the absence of an association between
   brain volume and activity behavior plasticity may result from the
   inaccuracy of using external skull measurements to estimate brain size,

Abstract = {{Personality in free-living individuals has predominantly been measured
   under standardized laboratory conditions. Such measurements have been
   then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it
   remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation
   shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken
   directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African
   striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity,
   boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the
   laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether
   personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context.
   Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts.
   Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated
   with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the
   resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All
   personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical
   personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure
   personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits
   were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In
   addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours
   measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that
   the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent
   variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all
   the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific
   syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements
   of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the
   laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same
   individuals show under natural conditions.
   Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits
   of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most
   recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as
   it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects

Abstract = {{Background: The use of the EQ-5D to asses the economic benefits of
   health technologies has led to questions about the cross-population
   transferability of preference weights to calculate health utility
   scores. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of UK
   and Canadian preference weights will lead to the calculation of
   different health utility scores in a sample of persons with Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and their primary informal caregivers.
   Methods: We recruited 216 patient-caregiver dyads from nine geriatric
   and memory clinics across Canada. Participants used the EQ-5D-3L to rate
   their health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). EQ-5D-3L responses were
   transformed into health utility scores using UK and Canadian preference
   weights. The levels of agreement between the two sets of scores were
   assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Bland-Altman
   plots depicted individual-level differences between the two sets of
   scores. Differences in health utility scores were tested using the
   Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. A generalized linear model with a gamma
   distribution was used to examine whether participants' socio-demographic
   characteristics were associated with their health utility scores.
   Results: The distributions of health utility scores derived from both
   the UK and Canadian preference weights were skewed to the left. The
   intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94 (95 \% CI: 0.92, 0.95) for
   persons with AD and 0.92 (95 \% CI: 0.88, 0.94) for the caregivers. The
   Canadian weights yielded slightly higher median health utility scores
   than the UK weights for caregivers (median difference: 0.009; 95 \%
   confidence interval: 0.007, 0.013). This finding persisted after
   stratifying by disease severity. Few socio-demographic characteristics
   were associated with the two sets of health utility scores.
   Conclusions: Health utility scores exhibited small and clinically
   unimportant differences when calculated with UK versus Canadian
   preference weights in persons with AD and their caregivers. The original
   UK and Canadian population samples used to obtain the preference weights

   addressed these questions using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia

   and Gyrodactylus ectoparasites for (ii) both wild-caught F0 and
   laboratory-reared F2 individuals and coming from (iii) multiple
   independent evolutionary lineages (i.e. independent drainages). Several
   key findings emerged. First, a population's history of predation and

   depending on the behaviour considered (activity, shoaling or boldness).
   Second, we had evidence for some genetic effects of predation regime on
   behaviour, with differences in activity of F2 laboratory-reared
   individuals, but not for parasitism, which had only plastic effects on
   the boldness of wild-caught F0 individuals. Third, the two lineages
   showed a mixture of parallel and nonparallel responses to

   Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male

Abstract = {{Survival depends on appropriate behavioural and physiological responses
   to danger. In addition to active fight-flight' defence responses, a
   passive freeze-hide' response is adaptive in some contexts. However, the
   physiological mechanisms determining which individuals choose a given
   defence response remain poorly understood. We examined the relationships
   among personality, metabolic performance and physiological stress
   responses across an environmental gradient in the olive flounder,
   Paralichthys olivaceus. We employed four behavioural assays to document
   the existence of two distinct behavioural types (bold' and shy') in this
   species. We found consistent metabolic differences between individuals
   of a given behavioural type across an environmental gradient: shy
   individuals had overall lower aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and
   standard metabolic rate than bold individuals in both high (25 ppt) and
   low (3 ppt) salinity. These behavioural and metabolic differences
   translated into divergent physiological responses during acute stress:
   shy individuals adopted a passive freeze-hide' response by reducing
   their oxygen consumption rates (akin to shallow breathing) whereas bold
   individuals adopted an active fight-flight' response by increasing their
   rates of respiration. These distinct defence strategies were repeatable
   within individuals between salinity treatments. Although it has been
   suggested theoretically, this is the first empirical evidence that the
   metabolic response to stressful situations differs between bold and shy
   individuals. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating
   physiological measures to understand the mechanisms driving persistent

   Methods: We studied 114 patients with non-melancholic depression.
   Reliability was assessed using the test-retest method. Convergent
   validity of the T\&P was compared with the clinician ratings of each
   patient for the eight personality traits. We also assessed the impact of

   Results: The test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients among eight
   constructs of the T\&P ranged from 0.77 to 0.89, indicating
   good-to-excellent reliability. Anxious Worrying (rho=0.29),
   Perfectionism (rho=0.17), Personal Reserve (rho=0.18), Irritability

Abstract = {{Selection may favour individuals of the same population to differ

   was correlated with its average daily intake of protein, and (iii)
   whether short-term changes in intake of carbohydrates coincided with
   changes in intake of protein within individuals. Intake rates were

Title = {{Does personality affect premating isolation between locally-adapted
   populations?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: One aspect of premating isolation between diverging,
   locally-adapted population pairs is female mate choice for resident over
   alien male phenotypes. Mating preferences often show considerable
   individual variation, and whether or not certain individuals are more
   likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied.
   In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted
   to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs, and females from adjacent
   non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We
   asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies
   (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate
   choice component of premating isolation in this system.
   Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found
   behavioral measures of `novel object exploration', `boldness' and
   `activity in an unknown area' to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the
   interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness
   affected focal females' strength of preference (SOP) for the resident
   male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High
   exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over
   alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/ or little
   explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the
   non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare
   population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific
   stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger
   preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared
   when the size difference between the stimulus males was small.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate
   choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the
   distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding
   reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the
   study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating
   decisions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Behavior varies among individuals and is flexible within individuals.
   However, studies of behavioral syndromes and animal personality have
   demonstrated that animals can show consistency in their behavior and as
   such may be restricted in their behavioral responses. Like any other
   trait, including morphology, performance, or physiology, personality is
   now considered an important component of ecology and may have fitness
   consequences. Moreover, in some species personality correlates with
   other traits, as predicted in the context of a recent theoretical
   framework postulating that individual differences in growth and body
   size can affect behavior through effects on growth-mortality tradeoffs.
   This ``pace of life{''} hypothesis predicts that animals that explore
   more should be larger and have higher growth rates than those that
   explore less. We tested for associations between morphology and a
   behavioral trait in a captive colony of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus). We used open-field tests to evaluate exploration behavior and
   measured a series of morphological traits in 72 individuals (32 males
   and 40 females). Our results show that the latency to start exploring
   correlates positively with adult body size and body weight at birth.
   These data provide evidence for a link between morphology and behavior
   in this species, thus supporting predictions of dispersal models but
   diverging from the predictions of the ``pace of life{''} model.}},

Title = {{Acoustic signalling reflects personality in a social mammal}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are often mediated through
   acoustic signals. If acoustic signals are consistent and related to an
   individual's personality, these consistent individual differences in
   signalling may be an important driver in social interactions. However,
   few studies in non-human mammals have investigated the relationship
   between acoustic signalling and personality. Here we show that acoustic
   signalling rate is repeatable and strongly related to personality in a
   highly social mammal, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica).
   Furthermore, acoustic signalling varied between environments of
   differing quality, with males from a poor-quality environment having a
   reduced vocalization rate compared with females and males from an
   enriched environment. Such differences may be mediated by personality
   with pigs from a poor-quality environment having more reactive and more
   extreme personality scores compared with pigs from an enriched
   environment. Our results add to the evidence that acoustic signalling
   reflects personality in a non-human mammal. Signals reflecting
   personalities may have far reaching consequences in shaping the
   evolution of social behaviours as acoustic communication forms an
   integral part of animal societies.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{53-59}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) represents an emergent trait of two
   interacting same-sex individuals. Although empirical studies have
   investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known
   about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype
   on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express
   male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a
   way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used
   both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the
   effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype
   on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We
   repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and
   different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the
   variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity
   effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the
   partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced
   the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting
   partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable
   components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not
   differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different
   levels (between-partner, or partner `personality', and within-partner
   levels, or partner `plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide
   the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in
   response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness
   of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test
   whether partners represent a component of the social environment
   affecting the expression of labile traits. (C) 2016 The Association for

Title = {{Methodology for Intraoperative Laser Doppler Vibrometry Measurements of
   Ossicular Chain Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{98-103}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. Despite the increasing number of research concerning the
   applications of the Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) in medicine, its
   usefulness is still under discussion. The aim of this study is to
   present a methodology developed in our Department for the LDV
   intraoperative assessment of ossicular chain reconstruction.
   Methods. Ten patients who underwent ``second look{''} tympanoplasty were
   involved in the study. The measurements of the acoustic conductivity of
   the middle ear were pedal used using the LDV system. Tone bursts with
   carrier frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz set in motion the
   ossicular chain. The study was divided into four experiments that
   examined the intra- and interindividual reproducibility, the utility of
   the posterior tympanotomy, the impact of changes in the laser beam
   angle, and the influence of reflective tape presence on measurements.
   Results. There were no statistically significant differences between the
   two measurements performed in the same patient. However, interindividual
   differences were significant. In all cases, posterior tympanotomy proved
   to be useful for LDV measurements of the ossicular prosthesis
   vibrations. In most cases, changing the laser beam angle decreased
   signal amplitude about 1.5\% (not significant change). The reflective
   tape was necessary to achieve adequate reflection of the laser beam.
   Conclusion. LDV showed to be a valuable noncontact intraoperative tool
   for measurements of the middle ear conductive system mobility with a
   very good intraindividual repeatability. Neither a small change in the
   angle of the laser beam nor performing the measurements through
   posterior tympanotomy showed a significant influence on the results.
   Reflective tape was necessary to obtain good quality responses in LDV
   measurements.}},

Pages = {{95-102}},

Abstract = {{Trait anxiety may be a predisposing factor for anxiety-related
   behavioural problems in dogs. This study aimed to measure and quantify
   trait anxiety using novel behavioural paradigms. Diazepam is an
   anxiolytic drug which can be used to validate behavioural paradigms that
   are designed to measure anxiety. Greyhound dogs from a Canine Blood Bank
   were recruited. Dogs were individually tested in two behavioural
   paradigms, named the modified open field and the unconditioned substrate
   preference. The modified open field test consisted of a standard open
   field test of 10 min duration, followed by six individual 10 kHz 110 dB
   1-second tones played every 30s, interspersed with continuous white
   noise played at increasing intensity from 10 dB up to 90 dB. For one
   group of dogs, the test was repeated three times, with two weeks between
   each test. The greyhounds were pre-treated orally with either an empty
   gel capsule (sham) or 1 mg/kg diazepam 90 min before the third trial
   (n=39). A second group was treated 90 min before a single naive exposure
   to the test (n=24). Video recordings of the trials were analysed using
   software which tracked the position of the dog over time. Total distance
   travelled demonstrated a high test-retest repeatability within subjects
   (Spearman's r=0.813, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.90, P<0.001) and was increased on
   average in both test-naive (167.6 m, 95\% CI: 54.8-280.4, P=0.005) and
   test-experienced (139.0 m, 95\% CI: 89.1-189.0, P<0.001) dogs that had
   been pre-treated with diazepam when compared with sham. A noise tone as
   a distance-increasing signal over time had a reduced effect on mean
   midline distance following diazepam pre-treatment when compared with
   sham in the test-naive (-0.79, 95\% CI: -1.6 to 0.0, P=0.047), but not
   to the same extent in the test-experienced (-0.47, 95\% CI: -1.5 to 0.6,
   P=0.370) dogs. The unconditioned substrate preference test consisted of
   a room that had a concrete floor with half the flooring covered with
   plastic (a floor substrate unfamiliar to the greyhounds). There was
   little effect of diazepam pre-treatment on preference for the novel
   plastic floor substrate. This study suggests that the anxiolytic effect
   of diazepam on dog behaviour may be measured through an increase in
   exploratory behaviour and a reduction in noise aversion. Furthermore,
   exploratory behaviour and noise aversion may represent aspects of
   underlying trait anxiety as these behaviours have reliable test-retest
   repeatability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stable differences in physiology among individuals may facilitate the
   evolution of consistent individual differences in behavior. In
   particular, according to the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis,
   individual variation in metabolic expenditure and stress physiology
   should be linked with exploration, aggression, or risk-taking behaviors.
   Previous studies have uncovered stable individual differences in
   metabolic expenditure and circulating glucorticoids in common lizards
   (Zootoca vivipara). We tested the correlations between standard
   metabolic rates (SMR), glucorticoid stress response, and behavioral
   traits (activity, aggressiveness, risk taking, and sociability) in
   males. In ectotherms, the thermal dependence of SMR should be included
   in the POLS hypothesis; we therefore measured SMR at three temperatures
   from rest to preferred body temperature. Activity, aggressiveness, and
   risk taking, but not sociability, exhibited significant, short-term
   repeatability, and little correlation was found between behavioral
   traits. The SMR of lizards with a low metabolism at rest increased
   faster with body temperature. The SMR at rest was negatively correlated
   with behavioral variation in sociability and activity but not with
   risk-taking behavior. In addition, the plasma corticosterone level after
   an acute handling stress increased slightly but not significantly with
   aggressiveness. We discuss alternative interpretations for these
   relationships and conclude that the link between inter-individual
   variation in physiology and behavior is trait-dependent in the common
   lizard.
   Selection better promotes the evolution of consistent differences in
   behavior, or personalities, when they are coupled with differences in
   physiology. In adult common lizards, inter-individual differences in
   metabolic expenditure and glucocorticoid stress response are consistent
   and could play a crucial role in the maintenance of personalities. This
   study supported partially this hypothesis. We found that more sociable
   and active personality types had a lower metabolic expenditure, while
   more aggressive personality types tended to have a higher physiological
   stress response. At the same time, physiology was not correlated with
   individual differences in risk-taking behavior and drove little part of
   behavioral variation. The coupling between personalities and physiology
   appears to be trait-dependent, suggesting that behaviors may be
   relatively free to evolve independently from physiology.}},

Abstract = {{Some dairy cows excrete large amounts of P through their urine; thus, it
   was speculated that a genetic defect related to their efficiency in
   uptake of P or recirculation of P could cause such an effect. This
   speculation was pursued in a cross sectional study on 139 cows (103
   Holstein and 36 Jersey) from an experimental herd using repeated
   sampling of urine (301 samples) to investigate sources of variation in
   urinary P concentration (Pu). Urine samples were taken on 6 testing
   sessions spread over 2 mo. Each sample was obtained by mild manual
   stimulation of the rear udder escutcheon area. The samples were
   immediately assayed for pH, stored frozen, and assayed for inorganic P
   and creatinine. Concentrations of P and creatinine in urine, the ratio
   of Pu to creatinine, and pH were analyzed using a linear mixed model.
   The model included fixed effects of breed, parity number, and sampling
   session. Stage of lactation was fitted as Wilmink-type lactation curves.
   Random effects included additive polygenic ancestry, permanent animal
   effects, and residual. The distribution of Pu approximated normality
   except for a single sample with very high Pu and very low pH. This
   sample came from a cow diagnosed independently with ketosis. For the
   remaining samples, it was shown that Pu has low to moderate heritability
   (0.12) and is only moderately repeatable (0.21). Based on a small data
   set, it is tentatively concluded that individual differences between
   cows exist in their Pu, and individual differences presumably result
   from genetic differences. However, it remains unclear if cows with
   genetically lower or higher Pu will perform better on a low-P diet.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative mating behaviour, personality traits and morphological
   characters are predicted to be correlated. Bolder, larger and more
   colourful males are expected to preferentially court females, while shy,
   small and drab-coloured individuals are predicted to sneak copulations.
   We used males of Endler's guppy, Poecilia wingei, to test this
   association over a long temporal period (hence including ontogenetic
   changes) and under two social environments (male-biased and
   female-biased). We found that personality traits (exploration, boldness,
   activity) of P.wingei males were highly repeatable across long time
   spans, but they were not correlated (formed no behavioural syndrome).
   Male age and social environment had no effect on any personality trait,
   despite their effects on alternative mating behaviour. Young males with
   higher activity levels were more likely to attempt sneaking. In older
   fish, there was an association between orange coloration, courtship and
   boldness, but this was not observed in young males. Our results suggest
   that alternative mating behaviour is more flexible than personality
   traits and is independent of them. Non-colour-based morphological traits
   (gonopodium length, body length, caudal straps length, dorsal fin
   length) were not correlated with any particular mating behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between offspring size and number is a central component
   of life-history theory, postulating that larger investment into
   offspring size inevitably decreases offspring number. This trade-off is
   generally discussed in terms of genetic, physiological or morphological
   constraints; however, as among-individual differences can mask
   individual trade-offs, the underlying mechanisms may be difficult to
   reveal. In this study, we use multivariate analyses to investigate
   whether there is a trade-off between offspring size and number in a
   population of sand lizards by separating among-and within-individual
   patterns using a 15-year data set collected in the wild. We also explore
   the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of this
   trade-off by investigating how a female's resource (condition)- vs.
   age-related size (snout-vent length) influences her investment into
   offspring size vs. number (OSN), whether these traits are heritable and
   under selection and whether the OSN trade-off has a genetic component.
   We found a negative correlation between offspring size and number within
   individual females and physical constraints (size of body cavity) appear
   to limit the number of eggs that a female can produce. This suggests
   that the OSN trade-off occurs due to resource constraints as a female
   continues to grow throughout life and, thus, produces larger clutches.
   In contrast to the assumptions of classic OSN theory, we did not detect
   selection on offspring size; however, there was directional selection
   for larger clutch sizes. The repeatabilities of both offspring size and
   number were low and we did not detect any additive genetic variance in
   either trait. This could be due to strong selection (past or current) on
   these life-history traits, or to insufficient statistical power to
   detect significant additive genetic effects. Overall, the findings of
   this study are an important illustration of how analyses of
   within-individual patterns can reveal trade-offs and their underlying
   causes, with potential evolutionary and ecological consequences that are
   otherwise hidden by among-individual variation.}},

   Method - This study (four parts) assessed the construct validity of the
   Schedule for Personality Assessment from Notes and Documents (SPAN-DOC),
   a dimensional assessment from clinical records. We examined inter-rater
   reliability using case vignettes (Part 1) and convergent validity in

   Results - Internal consistency (alpha = .90) and inter-rater reliability

Abstract = {{Animals adjust their behaviour over time and contexts to cope with
   ecological and environmental variation. However, the presence of
   consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e.
   personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible
   than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the
   experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect
   estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and
   risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki,
   a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk
   taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a
   standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied
   linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter
   mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity
   increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks
   was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on
   average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We
   highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal
   variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with
   escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small
   environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank
   size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking
   and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality
   estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank
   orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that
   behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that
   personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to
   variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones. (C) 2016

Title = {{Shy is sometimes better: personality and juvenile body mass affect adult
   reproductive success in wild boars, Sus scrofa}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to
   different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether
   these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare.
   Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive
   success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the
   exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests
   and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour
   (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness
   were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal
   component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the
   females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in
   two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014
   we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our
   results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected
   by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which
   may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female
   reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was
   only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at
   the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was
   additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food
   availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and
   explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We
   conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of
   the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive
   impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food
   availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of
   personality on reproductive success differed between changing
   environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that
   different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by
   varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Behavioral repeatability of flour beetles before and after metamorphosis

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral repeatability is an important trait relevant to personality
   research and to behavioral ecology in general. We examined here the
   behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and
   edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge).
   We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine
   whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and
   whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than
   larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral
   repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae
   and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These
   findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably
   reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during
   metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral
   repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young
   adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained
   similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on
   repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two
   pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for
   the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual
   differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a
   shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was
   also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable
   than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may
   be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies.
   We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in
   insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual
   behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage,
   and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question
   has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full
   metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an
   opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous
   results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial
   metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important,
   because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This
   is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on
   differences between males and females, probably indicating on
   differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging.
   Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been
   already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{155-165}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the presence of predators, many prey species exhibit immediate
   behavioral responses like the avoidance of risky areas, which imposes
   opportunity costs, for instance, in the form of reduced foraging. Thus,
   prey species should be able to discriminate between different predator
   types and adjust their response to the imminent predation risk. In our
   current study, we evaluated the relative importance of innate versus
   learned components of predator recognition and avoidance in the guppy
   (Poecilia reticulata). We used a feral guppy population occurring in
   Germany and compared avoidance reactions of each focal individual
   towards both coevolved piscine predators from their original
   distribution range and novel, presently co-occurring predator species.
   Wild-caught, predator-experienced as well as laboratory-reared,
   predator-na < ve individuals showed strong avoidance responses towards
   all predator animations. Avoidance was stronger in small-bodied than in
   large-bodied individuals in both cohorts; however, this effect was
   significant only in predator-na < ve fish. Moreover, wild-caught
   individuals showed a significantly higher within-individual variance
   (across the six predator species) along with a lower among-individual
   variance in predator avoidance, which resulted in a lower behavioral
   repeatability in this cohort. Our results suggest that consistent
   individual differences in risk-taking behavior (also referred to as the
   personality trait `boldness') are modified by predator exposure and
   learning about predators.}},

   segmentation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The volumetric quantification of brain structures is of great interest
   in pediatric populations because it allows the investigation of
   different factors influencing neurodevelopment. FreeSurfer and FSL both
   provide frequently used packages for automatic segmentation of brain
   structures. In this study, we examined the accuracy and consistency of
   those two automated protocols relative to manual segmentation, commonly
   considered as the ``gold standard{''} technique, for estimating
   hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a sample of preadolescent children
   aged between 6 to 11 years. The volumes obtained with FreeSurfer and
   FSL-FIRST were evaluated and compared with manual segmentations with
   respect to volume difference, spatial agreement and between-and
   within-method correlations.
   Results highlighted a tendency for both automated techniques to
   overestimate hippocampus and amygdala volumes, in comparison to manual
   segmentation. This was more pronounced when using FreeSurfer than
   FSL-FIRST and, for both techniques, the over estimation was more marked
   for the amygdala than the hippocampus. Pearson correlations support
   moderate associations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer for
   hippocampus (right r = 0.69, p < 0.001; left r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and
   amygdala (right r = 0.61, p < 0.001; left r = 0.67, p < 0.001) volumes.
   Correlation coefficients between manual segmentation and FSL-FIRST were
   statistically significant (right hippocampus r = 0.59, p < 0.001; left
   hippocampus r = 0.51, p < 0.001; right amygdala r = 0.35, p < 0.001;
   left amygdala r = 0.31, p < 0.001) but were significantly weaker, for
   all investigated structures. When computing intraclass correlation
   coefficients between manual tracing and automatic segmentation, all
   comparisons, except for left hippocampus volume estimated with
   FreeSurfer, failed to reach 0.70. When looking at each method
   separately, correlations between left and right hemispheric volumes
   showed strong associations between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral
   amygdala volumes when assessed using manual segmentation or FreeSurfer.
   These correlations were significantly weaker when volumes were assessed
   with FSL-FIRST. Finally, Bland-Altman plots suggest that the difference
   between manual and automatic segmentation might be influenced by the
   volume of the structure, because smaller volumes were associated with
   larger volume differences between techniques.
   These results demonstrate that, at least in a pediatric population, the
   agreement between amygdala and hippocampus volumes obtained with
   automated FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer protocols and those obtained with
   manual segmentation is not strong. Visual inspection by an informed
   individual and, if necessary, manual correction of automated
   segmentation outputs are important to ensure validity of volumetric
   results and interpretation of related findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Consistent behavioral differences among individuals, or personalities,
   have been hypothesized to arise as a result of consistent individual
   differences in hormone levels. Individual variation in baseline hormone
   levels or hormonal similarity within a breeding pair may be related to
   reproductive success, as suggested by the corticosterone-fitness
   hypothesis and the hormonal similarity hypothesis, respectively. In a
   population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) with repeatable
   behavioral expression and coordination of behavior within pairs, we
   tested if baseline androgen and corticosterone levels are related to
   behavioral expression, if coordination in behavior within pairs is
   facilitated by hormonal coordination, and if baseline hormone levels are
   related to fledging success at the individual or pair level. We found no
   significant relationship between hormone levels and nest visit rate or
   nest defense for either sex. Androgen and corticosterone levels were not
   correlated within pairs, but pairs in which males exhibited more
   aggressive nest defense behavior than females were also more different
   in androgen levels. Females with higher baseline corticosterone levels
   fledged more young, but hormonal similarity within pairs was not related
   to fledging success. Our results provide support for the
   corticosterone-adaptation hypothesis, which suggests that elevation of
   baseline corticosterone levels may occur during breeding to meet
   increased energetic demands. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behavior are of interest to

   Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis using individually conducted

   selection on boldness-indicating behavior. Perch expressed repeatable
   individual differences in boldness-indicating behavior but the

Abstract = {{Depression affects millions of people worldwide, with no regard to
   socioeconomic status or ethnic background. Treatment resistance, defined
   as the lack of response to first-line, widely prescribed pharmacologic
   antidepressant treatments, affects up to 20\% of patients with

   developing symptom chronicity and subsequent poor social and functional
   adjustment. TRD is a clinically heterogeneous entity, with significant
   comorbidities from personality traits or disorders, substance use
   disorders, chronic medical/physical issues, misdiagnosed bipolar
   illness, and anxiety or psychosis issues. For optimal treatment planning
   and to maximize response and symptom resolution, treatment resistance
   needs to be differentiated from the above-mentioned comorbidities.
   Strategies for pharmacologic treatment when a first-line antidepressant
   regimen fails include switching to another antidepressant (inter-or
   intraclass switching), augmentation with a mood stabilizer or atypical
   antipsychotic, or use of thyroid hormone. Drugs with glutamatergic

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{Rates of innovative foraging behaviours and success on problem-solving
   tasks are often used to assay differences in cognition, both within and
   across species. Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks
   can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive
   mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have
   revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in
   problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks,
   Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive
   processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether
   performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational
   mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage
   with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via
   physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects'
   participation and success were consistent within the same problems and
   across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across
   different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each
   test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not
   repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their
   performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their
   techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals
   that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more
   likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to
   approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to
   solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore
   suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise
   from inherent motivational differences alone and hence be achieved
   without inferring more complex cognitive processes. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to explore the variation between individuals
   in the response to and recovery from a nutritional challenge, the
   repeatability of responses between lactation stages, and the use of
   shape-clustering methods to classify similar individuals. Sixteen dairy
   goats were exposed to a 2-d nutritional challenge (underfeeding) at 2
   different stages of lactation. Each challenge consisted of a 7-d control
   period with standard total mixed ration (TMR), 2 d of straw-only
   feeding, and a 10-d recovery period on the TMR. All feeds were offered
   ad libitum, as was water. The first challenge was in late lactation on
   primiparous goats (mean days in milk = 249), and the second challenge
   was carried out on the same goats early in the following lactation (mean
   days in milk = 28). The main energetic response traits dry matter intake
   (DMI), milk yield, body weight, milk fat and protein contents, and
   plasma glucose, fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), urea,
   and insulin, were measured daily throughout. A clustering procedure
   linked to a piecewise mixed model was used to characterize different
   types of response. As expected, straw feeding caused a large decline in
   DMI and milk yield, and substantial increases in milk fat and milk
   protein composition, relative to the prechallenge period on the control
   TMR. For both DMI and milk yield, the slope of the response, and hence
   the size of the drop, was strongly related to the prechallenge values,
   indicating that these 2 measures were tightly constrained by the
   challenge. Regression slopes between lactation stages for responses to
   the same nutritional challenge were significant for DMI, milk protein
   content, plasma BHB and urea, and body weight, indicating that
   within-animal responses in late and early lactation were repeatable. The
   clustering procedure generally performed well, classifying both scaling
   differences and differences in shape. The extent of reranking of cluster
   designations between late lactation and the following early lactation
   period was examined. For milk yield, DMI, body weight, and urea,
   relatively little reranking occurred; the numbers of goats not changing
   class number were 10, 12, 10, and 13, respectively. In contrast, for
   milk contents of fat and protein, and also for BHB, no clear association
   was found between late and early lactation class numbers. For NEFA and
   glucose, these comparisons were not relevant because either the vast
   majority of goats were in 1 cluster (NEFA) or because an outlier goat
   skewed the cluster designation (glucose in late lactation). For insulin,
   9 out of 16 goats kept the same rank.}},

Abstract = {{Saccadic tasks are widely used to study cognitive processes, effects of
   pharmacological treatments, and mechanisms underlying psychiatric
   disorders. In genetic studies, it is assumed that saccadic
   endophenotypes are traits. While internal consistency and temporal
   stability of saccadic performance is high for most of the measures, the
   magnitude of underlying trait components has not been estimated, and
   influences of situational aspects and person by situation interactions
   have not been investigated. To do so, 68 healthy participants performed
   prosaccades, antisaccades, and memory-guided saccades on three occasions
   at weekly intervals at the same time of day. Latent state-trait modeling
   was applied to estimate the proportions of variance reflecting stable
   trait components, situational influences, and Person x Situation
   interaction effects. Mean variables for all saccadic tasks showed high
   to excellent reliabilities. Intraindividual standard deviations were
   found to be slightly less reliable. Importantly, an average of 60\% of
   variance of a single measurement was explained by trans-situationally
   stable person effects, while situation aspects and interactions between
   person and situation were found to play a negligible role. We conclude
   that saccadic variables, in standard laboratory settings, represent
   highly reliable measures that are largely unaffected by situational

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in animal performance drive individual

   concept is the assumption that individuals will display consistent
   levels of performance in fitness-related traits and interest has focused
   on individual variation and broad sense repeatability in a range of
   behavioural and physiological traits. Despite playing a central role in
   maintenance and growth, and with considerable inter-individual variation
   documented, broad sense repeatability in rates of protein synthesis has
   not been assessed. In this study we show for the first time that
   juvenile flounder Platichthys flesus reared under controlled
   environmental conditions on the same plane of nutrition for 46 days
   maintain consistent whole-animal absolute rates of protein synthesis
   (A(s)). By feeding meals containing N-15-labelled protein and using a
   stochastic end-point model, two non-terminal measures of protein
   synthesis were made 32 days apart (d(14) and d(46)). A(s) values
   (mass-corrected to a standard mass of 12 g) showed 2- to 3-fold
   variation between individuals on d(14) and d(46) but individuals showed
   similar A(s) values on both days with a broad sense repeatability
   estimate of 0.684 indicating significant consistency in physiological
   performance under controlled experimental conditions. The use of
   non-terminal methodologies in studies of animal ecophysiology to make
   repeat measures of physiological performance enables known individuals
   to be tracked across changing conditions. Adopting this approach, repeat
   measures of protein synthesis under controlled conditions will allow
   individual ontogenetic changes in protein metabolism to be assessed to
   better understand the ageing process and to determine individual
   physiological adaptive capacity, and associated energetic costs of
   adaptation, to global environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits is increasingly a

   attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors

   flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in
   fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could
   alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve
   the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater
   understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to
   forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate
   change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited
   by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time
   scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in
   technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and
   biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased
   quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative
   traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural
   traits.}},

   in armour phenotype from fully armoured to non-armoured morphs.
   Aim: Investigate the connection between individual variation in
   behaviour and armour morphology within and across populations.
   Study organism and site: During the Spring of 2015, we assayed the
   behaviour of 250 sticklebacks from seven populations on the Scottish
   island of North Uist, located in the Outer Hebrides.
   Hypotheses: The `phenotypic compensation' hypothesis holds that
   individuals with poorer defences should behave more timidly. Yet the
   energetic costs associated with bearing armour should reduce both the
   activity and exploration behaviour of more heavily armoured individuals.
   Methods: We assayed individual stickleback for boldness, exploration,
   and activity. We then stained the fish with Alizarin red, which allowed
   the characterization of the armour phenotype of each fish.
   Results: Across populations, bold fish were less armoured than their shy
   counterparts and active fish were more armoured. Exploratory behaviour
   was not correlated with armour phenotype.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral similarity between partners is likely to promote within-pair
   compatibility and to result in better reproductive success. Therefore,
   individuals are expected to choose a partner that is alike in behavioral
   type. However, mate searching is very costly and does not guarantee
   finding a matching partner. If mismatched individuals pair, they may
   benefit from increasing their similarity after pairing. We show in a
   monogamous fish species-the convict cichlid-that the behavioral
   similarity between mismatched partners can increase after pairing. This
   increase resulted from asymmetrical adjustment because only the reactive
   individual became more alike its proactive partner, whereas the latter
   did not change its behavior. The mismatched pairs that increased their
   similarity not only improved their reproductive success but also raised
   it up to the level of matched pairs. While most studies assume that
   assortative mating results from mate choice, our study suggests that
   postpairing adjustment could be an alternative explanation for the high
   behavioral similarity between partners observed in the field. It also
   explains why interindividual behavioral differences can be maintained
   within a given population.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-234}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The study of iridescent coloration in birds emerged only recently,
   mainly due to the difficulty inherent in quantifying its directionality.
   Directionality restrains color perception to a limited angle and thereby
   causes drastic changes in brightness when an animal is in motion.
   Although a versatile goniometer for quantifying iridescent coloration
   has been developed recently, so far, it has only been applied to
   measuring the highly directional iridescent coloration in a hummingbird
   species. Thus, the reliability of the goniometer for species displaying
   more common and less directional iridescent coloration has yet to be
   evaluated. Additionally, two important methodological aspects remain to
   be assessed before this apparatus can be used confidently: 1) whether
   directionality, which could be subject to sexual selection, can be
   quantified in a repeatable way; and 2) whether the apparatus gives more
   precise and accurate measurements than a less complex traditional
   method. Using feathers collected from 271 male tree swallows Tachycineta
   bicolor over two years, we found that the goniometer provided repeatable
   measurements of directionality across individuals and across three body
   regions, namely the crown, mantle and rump. The apparatus was also more
   repeatable than a traditional method involving a bifurcated probe and
   reduced a brightness bias associated with individual differences in
   barbule tilt. We strongly encourage researchers to invest in this
   methodological change considering the multiple advantages demonstrated
   and to quantify the directionality of iridescent coloration as to unveil
   its role in signaling and sexual selection.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{369-378}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Individual differences in metabolic rate have been linked with
   variations in behaviour and key life-history traits and can affect
   ecological patterns within animal populations. Yet, almost nothing is
   known of the plasticity of the metabolic response under dynamically
   changing conditions that are representative of the natural environment.
   This is surprising since the capacity for animals to cope with rapidly
   changing environments depends on phenotypic variation and plasticity
   among members of the population. 2. We measured the standard metabolic
   rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) of 60
   juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) under acclimation conditions
   (35ppt salinity, 29 degrees C, normoxia) and when the fish were
   sequentially faced with low salinity (10ppt), high temperature (35
   degrees C) and hypoxia (45\% air saturation) with each treatment
   separated by approximate to 12days. 3. The overall degree of
   interindividual variation in body-mass-standardised SMR, MMR and AS
   changed with environmental conditions, and a metabolic coupling was
   revealed between SMR and MMR when the fish were faced with the
   environmental changes. The metabolic response to environmental change
   differed widely and predictably at an individual level. Individuals that
   had elevated metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions showed
   little change in SMR, MMR or AS in response to low salinity and high
   temperature, but MMR and AS were greatly depressed by hypoxia. In
   contrast, individuals with low-metabolic attributes under acclimation
   conditions displayed a substantial increase in SMR, MMR and AS in
   response to high temperature and (to a lesser extent) low salinity, but
   hypoxia had very little effect. 4. These findings reveal how phenotypic
   diversity in key physiological traits can create differential plasticity
   towards environmental change within a population by showing how
   individual fish can remain metabolically insensitive to one
   environmental stressor at the cost of being highly sensitive to another.}},

Abstract = {{Observed movement patterns are the response of the interaction between

   investigated the nocturnal movement behaviour of a territorial species,
   by radiotracking 26 eagle owls Bubo bubo in order to analyze within and
   between individual variation with respect to movement parameters and
   route choice. Owls showed a considerable individual consistency in all
   movement parameters and made repeated use of similar routes while moving
   within fixed home ranges. Thus, movement parameters varied much less
   between repeated nightly trajectories than between different
   individuals. Furthermore, when we compared different individuals
   inhabiting the same territory in different years, within-group
   repeatability was low or non-significant suggesting that the spatial
   configuration of habitat does not always represents one of the main
   drivers in animal movement behaviour. Similarly, male individuals
   appeared to exhibit greater repeatability than females. The overall

Journal = {{SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{145-148}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is no baseline activity scale yet validated in
   pediatric patients. The Marx and Tegner scales have been validated in
   adult patients only. The Tegner scale involves questions not pertinent
   to children, such as their work activity. The Marx scale is simple, and
   all its questions can be related to athletic activities.
   Hypothesis: The Marx scale is reliable for use in a pediatric
   population.
   Study Design: Cohort study.
   Level of Evidence: Level 2.
   Methods: Patients younger than 18 years were given the Marx activity
   scale in clinic and again 3 weeks later. The patients were divided into
   3 groups, of at least 50 patients each, based on presenting diagnosis:
   knee injury, lower extremity (nonknee) injury, and upper extremity
   injury. Test-retest reliability was determined for the overall scores
   and the individual questions. Differences in scores were also compared
   based on age (< 14 vs = 14 years).
   Results: A total of 162 patients (mean age, 14.4 years; range, 8-17
   years) were included. The Marx scale had a high intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC) overall as well as for each of its 4 questions. Both
   older and younger patients had ICCs > 0.80, though the older group
   generally had higher scores. The mean score was 13.55 (out of 16), and
   50.6\% scored the maximum; only 1.9\% scored the minimum. Mean scores
   for the knee, lower extremity, and upper extremity groups were 13.71
   (SD, 3.70), 13.22 (SD, 4.18), and 13.68 (SD, 3.33), respectively (P >
   0.05). There also was no difference in total score based on age (P =
   0.88).
   Conclusion: The Marx activity scale is reliable in patients younger than
   18 years with injuries to the knee and lower extremities, though the
   scale was less reliable in patients younger than 14 years. There is a
   significant ceiling effect present, which limits its overall usefulness.
   Clinical Relevance: Although there is no other current substitute, the
   Marx activity scale is not an ideal measurement of younger patients'
   baseline activity levels.}},

Abstract = {{Within populations, free-living birds display considerable variation in
   observable sleep behaviors, reflecting dynamic interactions between
   individuals and their environment. Genes are expected to contribute to
   repeatable between-individual differences in sleep behaviors, which may
   be associated with individual fitness. We identified and genotyped
   polymorphisms in nine candidate genes for sleep, and measured five
   repeatable sleep behaviors in free-living great tits (Parus major),
   partly replicating a previous study in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus).
   Microsatellites in the CLOCK and NPAS2 clock genes exhibited an
   association with sleep duration relative to night length, and morning
   latency to exit the nest box, respectively. Furthermore, microsatellites
   in the NPSR1 and PCSK2 genes associated with relative sleep duration and
   proportion of time spent awake at night, respectively. Given the
   detection rate of associations in the same models run with random
   markers instead of candidate genes, we expected two associations to
   arise by chance. The detection of four associations between candidate
   genes and sleep, however, suggests that clock genes, a clock-related
   gene, or a gene involved in the melanocortin system, could play key
   roles in maintaining phenotypic variation in sleep behavior in avian
   populations. Knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying sleep
   behavior in the wild is important because it will enable ecologists to
   assess the evolution of sleep in response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat selection is a fundamental behaviour that links individuals to
   the resources required for survival and reproduction. Although natural
   selection acts on an individual's phenotype, research on habitat
   selection often pools inter-individual patterns to provide inferences on
   the population scale. Here, we expanded a traditional approach of
   quantifying habitat selection at the individual level to explore the
   potential for consistent individual differences of habitat selection. We
   used random coefficients in resource selection functions (RSFs) and
   repeatability estimates to test for variability in habitat selection. We
   applied our method to a detailed dataset of GPS relocations of brown
   bears (Ursus arctos) taken over a period of 6 years, and assessed
   whether they displayed repeatable individual differences in habitat
   selection toward two habitat types: bogs and recent timber-harvest cut
   blocks. In our analyses, we controlled for the availability of habitat,
   i.e. the functional response in habitat selection. Repeatability
   estimates of habitat selection toward bogs and cut blocks were 0.304 and
   0.420, respectively. Therefore, 30.4 and 42.0 \% of the population-scale
   habitat selection variability for bogs and cut blocks, respectively, was
   due to differences among individuals, suggesting that consistent
   individual variation in habitat selection exists in brown bears. Using
   simulations, we posit that repeatability values of habitat selection are
   not related to the value and significance of beta estimates in RSFs.
   Although individual differences in habitat selection could be the
   results of non-exclusive factors, our results illustrate the
   evolutionary potential of habitat selection.}},

Abstract = {{As the evolutionary responses to environmental change depend on
   selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and
   between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration
   research, multiyear tracks are thus needed to estimate the individual
   consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently
   provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in
   animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and
   timing between two migratory birds, the marsh harrier, Circus
   aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite
   tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in
   timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but
   the reverse pattern for marsh harriers. This was mainly caused by (1)
   larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front
   migration) than for marsh harriers (corridor migration) and a higher
   degree of repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2)
   higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among marsh
   harriers, while individual ospreys were more flexible. Our findings
   suggest that individuality in space and time is not a shared trait
   complex among migrants, but may show adaptive variation depending on the
   species' life history and ecology. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are under threat from

   a highly predatory amphipod that has spread readily across Central
   Europe and recently the UK and its arrival has been associated with the
   significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its
   behavioral ecology are sparse, even though its behavior may contribute
   to its invasion success. For the first time, we investigated
   antipredator ``fleeing{''} behavior in D. villosus and how this changed
   with water temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis.
   First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but
   consistent among-individual differences in behavior. These are driven by
   a combination of mean level among-individual differences and
   within-individual relative consistency in behavior, and provide the key
   marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were not
   influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all
   individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus,
   indicating a capacity for individual learning. We suggest that the
   antipredator behavior of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and
   that consistent among-individual differences in behavior may promote
   biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to
   changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous,
   particularly in an era of global climate change, where average
   temperatures could be elevated and less predictable.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is rapidly converting natural landscapes into habitats

   novel stressors such as increased human disturbance, different suites of
   predators, new food types and altered habitats and complexity. Species
   may need to adjust aspects of their behaviour to cope with these novel
   stressors and persist in areas following urbanization. Sydney,
   Australia's largest city, has undergone rapid population and geographic
   expansion over two centuries, but remains a mosaic of natural and
   heavily urbanized habitats. We adopted a behavioural syndrome approach
   to investigate whether urbanization has influenced the behaviour of the
   delicate skink Lampropholis delicata in the Sydney region. Lizards from
   one of the urban populations were more active, and more likely to forage
   for food, than individuals from the other three populations, but there
   was no difference in activity or foraging behaviour between urban and
   non-urban populations overall. Skinks from urban and non-urban habitats
   did not differ in their exploratory or basking behaviours. Activity,
   exploratory behaviour and foraging behaviour were all repeatable, and a
   behavioural syndrome linking high activity with increased exploration
   was evident. Our study documents the impact of urbanization on an
   understudied taxonomic group in the Southern Hemisphere, where
   urbanization has occurred relatively recently, and suggests that the

   polymorphisms in the genes are related to variation in behaviour. Here,
   we compared the genetic variation of the two personality' genes, DRD4

Title = {{Recent social conditions affect boldness repeatability in individual
   sticklebacks}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and have
   been shown both to influence individual behaviour in the social context
   and to be affected by it. However, little attention has been paid to
   possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality
   expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated
   how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of
   three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual
   assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or
   socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking
   task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness
   repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing
   much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for
   which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a
   temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed
   solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial.
   These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the
   short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of
   personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This
   finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when
   designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between
   animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role
   of social carryover effects. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf

Abstract = {{I experimentally tested the repeatability and plasticity of two

   changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal
   changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became
   increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this
   behaviour is plastic. There was, however, no evidence of

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Transcriptomic analysis can complement traditional ecotoxicology data by
   providing mechanistic insight, and by identifying sub-lethal organismal
   responses and contaminant classes underlying observed toxicity. Before
   transcriptomic information can be used in monitoring and risk
   assessment, it is necessary to determine its reproducibility and detect
   key steps impacting the reliable identification of differentially
   expressed genes. A custom 15K-probe microarray was used to conduct
   transcriptomics analyses across six laboratories with estuarine
   amphipods exposed to cyfluthrin-spiked or control sediments (10 days).
   Two sample types were generated, one consisted of total RNA extracts
   (Ex) from exposed and control samples (extracted by one laboratory) and
   the other consisted of exposed and control whole body amphipods (WB)
   from which each laboratory extracted RNA. Our findings indicate that
   gene expression microarray results are repeatable. Differentially
   expressed data had a higher degree of repeatability across all
   laboratories in samples with similar RNA quality (Ex) when compared to
   WB samples with more variable RNA quality. Despite such variability a
   subset of genes were consistently identified as differentially expressed
   across all laboratories and sample types. We found that the differences
   among the individual laboratory results can be attributed to several
   factors including RNA quality and technical expertise, but the overall
   results can be improved by following consistent protocols and with
   appropriate training. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Genotype by environment interaction for tick resistance of Hereford and
   Braford beef cattle using reaction norm models}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The cattle tick is a parasite that adversely affects
   livestock performance in tropical areas. Although countries such as
   Australia and Brazil have developed genetic evaluations for tick
   resistance, these evaluations have not considered genotype by
   environment (G{*}E) interactions. Genetic gains could be adversely
   affected, since breedstock comparisons are environmentally dependent on
   the presence of G{*}E interactions, particularly if residual variability
   is also heterogeneous across environments. The objective of this study
   was to infer upon the existence of G{*}E interactions for tick
   resistance of cattle based on various models with different assumptions
   of genetic and residual variability.
   Methods: Data were collected by the Delta G Connection Improvement
   program and included 10,673 records of tick counts on 4363 animals.
   Twelve models, including three traditional animal models (AM) and nine
   different hierarchical Bayesian reaction norm models (HBRNM), were
   investigated. One-step models that jointly estimate environmental
   covariates and reaction norms and two-step models based on previously
   estimated environmental covariates were used to infer upon G{*}E
   interactions. Model choice was based on the deviance criterion
   information.
   Results: The best-fitting model specified heterogeneous residual
   variances across 10 subclasses that were bounded by every decile of the
   contemporary group (CG) estimates of tick count effects. One-step models
   generally had the highest estimated genetic variances. Heritability
   estimates were normally higher for HBRNM than for AM. Onestep models
   based on heterogeneous residual variances also usually led to higher
   heritability estimates. Estimates of repeatability varied along the
   environmental gradient (ranging from 0.18 to 0.45), which implies that
   the relative importance of additive and permanent environmental effects
   for tick resistance is influenced by the environment. Estimated genetic
   correlations decreased as the tick infestation level increased, with
   negative correlations between extreme environmental levels, i.e.,
   between more favorable (low infestation) and harsh environments (high
   infestation).
   Conclusions: HBRNM can be used to describe the presence of G{*}E
   interactions for tick resistance in Hereford and Braford beef cattle.
   The preferred model for the genetic evaluation of this population for
   tick counts in Brazilian climates was a one-step model that considered
   heteroscedastic residual variance. Reaction norm models are a powerful
   tool to identify and quantify G{*}E interactions and represent a
   promising alternative for genetic evaluation of tick resistance, since
   they are expected to lead to greater selection efficiency and genetic
   progress.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1373-1378}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: The Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST) is a
   self-report tool that measures sleep reactivity (i.e., vulnerability to
   experience situational insomnia under stressful conditions). Sleep
   reactivity has been termed a ``trait-like{''} vulnerability; however,
   evidence of its long-term stability is lacking. The main objective of
   the current psychometric study was to investigate the temporal stability
   of the FIRST over two 6-mo intervals in a population-based sample of
   adults with and without insomnia. The temporal stability of the FIRST
   was also compared with the temporal stability of other scales associated
   with insomnia (trait-anxiety, arousability).
   Methods: Participants included 1,122 adults (mean age = 49.9 y, standard
   deviation = 14.8; 38.8\% male) presenting with an insomnia syndrome (n =
   159), insomnia symptoms (n = 152), or good sleep (n = 811). Participants
   completed the FIRST, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait-anxiety),
   and the Arousal Predisposition Scale (arousability) on three different
   occasions: baseline and at 6-and 12-mo follow-up. Intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) were computed for all scales (baseline to 6 mo and 6
   to 12 mo).
   Results: The FIRST yielded strong temporal stability from baseline to 6
   mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.81), symptoms (ICC =
   0.78), and good sleep (ICC = 0.81). Similar results were observed for 6
   to 12 mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.74), insomnia
   symptoms (ICC = 0.82), and good sleep (ICC = 0.84). The stability of the
   FIRST was not comparable with the stability of trait-anxiety, but was
   somewhat comparable with the stability of arousability.
   Conclusions: Overall, the FIRST is a temporally reliable stable scale
   over 6-mo intervals. Future research is needed to corroborate the
   stability and trait-like measures of sleep reactivity with
   physiological, behavioural and personality measures.}},

Abstract = {{While among-individual variation in behaviour, or personality, is common

   Pace of Life syndrome (POLS) provides one possible explanation for
   maintenance of personality differences. POLS predicts that metabolic
   differences will covary with behavioural variation, with high metabolism
   associated with risk prone behaviour and `faster' life histories (e.g.,
   high growth, early maturation). We used a repeated measures approach,
   assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test
   these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We
   found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and
   growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly
   faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support
   for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while
   personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do
   not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported.}},

   nearby facility where they were inverted up to five times. Most animals
   improved their righting times and exhibited within-individual
   consistency and among individual differences in righting method. We
   posit that it may be favourable to employ a consistent righting method

Abstract = {{The field of animal personality has received considerable attention in

   This study investigated docility, a measure of boldness, in two Port

   developed a struggle test as an assay for docility, which is
   particularly amenable to field studies. The struggle test was effective,
   and repeatable inter-individual docility differences were observed. Sex,
   but not population, influenced docility scores, with male sharks being
   less docile than females. This difference is likely due to the
   contrasting role each sex plays during mating. We also found
   individualized lateralization. However, no individual-level relationship
   between lateralization and docility was detected. Despite reported links

Abstract = {{Context There is growing recognition of the importance of animal
   personality in wildlife ecology and management. Individuals that differ
   consistently in their behaviours from others of the same population are
   considered to exhibit different personalities. Personality can be easily
   quantified with repeat tests on animals held in captivity. However,
   captive-based tests may not always be possible for logistical reasons
   and tests conducted in captivity can alter naturally occurring
   behaviours. Development of methods to assess personality in the field
   over short-term capture is an important alternative to long-term captive
   tests.
   Aims To develop and refine field-based tests that can be used to easily
   define personality traits of wild common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula), eliminating the need to bring individuals into captivity for
   an extended period of time.
   Methods We developed a series of short-term capture protocols to
   quantify personality traits of the common brushtail possum in the field,
   using handling-bag tests, modified open-field tests, trap-behaviour
   tests and release tests.
   Key results Personality traits of brushtail possums could be measured in
   several different ways, but refining methods was crucial to reveal
   traits efficiently. Behaviours related to several personality traits
   (boldness, docility and activity/exploration) could be measured rapidly
   in the field with our methods, and were repeatable over time.
   Conclusions Rapid, reliable and easy-to-perform quantification of
   personality of brushtail possums in the field is possible. This may
   sometimes be the only available option, and has advantages over long
   captive trials in terms of animal welfare and cost.
   Implications The present study provides a baseline for future research
   on the personality of common brushtail possums and its application to
   management and control strategies for the species.}},

   resting EEG and EEG during patients' sleep and the influence of
   radiofrequency EMF on the cardiovascular regulation. In other analyzed
   areas (EMF impact on sleep, the evoked potentials and cognitive
   processes), there are no consistent results supporting any influence of
   electromagnetic fields. Neurophysiological studies of the effect of
   radio- and microwaves on the brain functions in humans are still

   repeatability of research and statistical uncertainties. However,
   methodological guidelines are already available giving a chance of
   unifying research that definitely needs to be continued in order to
   identify biophysical mechanisms of interaction between EMFs and the

   or an organized community of citizens, a public organization, s/he
   ultimately comes in a certain relationship with another person.
   Distinctive features of social relations are commonness and
   repeatability. It is generally accepted that the part of the spectrum of
   social relations regulated by the law is called legal relations. The law
   cannot regulate all relations between people in the literal sense.
   Interpersonal relations in everyday life, neighbor relations,
   friendship, intimate relations between a husband and a wife: this is not
   a complete list of relations between people that are not governed by the
   law, but at the same time play an important role in everyone's life.
   Every person since his/her birth enters the system of already
   established and settled legal relations. In any case, any legal
   relations are the result of conscious human activity. At the heart of
   every relationship is a conscious activity of people. This is the first
   point the author focuses his attention on. Public relations becoming
   legal ones acquire a number of new properties. Since legal relations are
   those established by the state, they are not only the content of certain
   legal norms, but they also receive a mandatory property of their
   execution. The government initially lays a possibility of legal
   enforcement in the rule of law and the resulting legal relations,
   because it is common knowledge that the rule of law without the
   possibility of its forced execution is actually no longer the rule of
   law: it is a well-intentioned wish, recommendation, advice, but not the
   rule of law. Another feature of legal relations is that by regulating
   relations between people they generally govern relations that are
   socially desirable and approved. At the same time, however, socially
   censured actions, actions that violate the requirements of legal norms:
   offenses and, in their extreme form, crimes, are not excluded. Still,
   law-abiding and infringing behavior is a result of the behavior of
   specific individuals, their intentional motivated behavior. Thus, any
   behavioral act regulated by a legal norm should distinguish actions
   themselves and their results: the impact of actions and the personality
   of the subject who committed these actions. Indeed, all actions are
   committed by a person. This is the second point the author focuses his
   attention on.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the current study was twofold: (1) to validate the use of
   action sport cameras for quantifying focus of visual attention in
   sailing and (2) to apply this method to examine whether an external
   focus of attention is associated with better performance in upwind
   sailing. To test the validity of this novel quantification method, we
   first calculated the agreement between gaze location measures and head
   orientation measures in 13 sailors sailing upwind during training
   regattas using a head mounted eye tracker. The results confirmed that
   for measuring visual focus of attention in upwind sailing, the agreement
   for the two measures was high (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
   = 0.97) and the 95\% limits of agreement were acceptable (between -8.0\%
   and 14.6\%). In a next step, we quantified the focus of visual attention
   in sailing upwind as fast as possible by means of an action sport
   camera. We captured sailing performance, operationalised as boat speed
   in the direction of the wind, and environmental conditions using a GPS,
   compass and wind meter. Four trials, each lasting 1 min, were analysed
   for 15 sailors each, resulting in a total of 30 upwind speed trials on
   port tack and 30 upwind speed trials on starboard tack. The results
   revealed that in sailing - within constantly changing environments - the
   focus of attention is not a significant predictor for better upwind
   sailing performances. This implicates that neither external nor internal
   foci of attention was per se correlated with better performances.
   Rather, relatively large interindividual differences seem to indicate
   that different visual attention strategies can lead to similar
   performance outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study aimed to validate a new observational measure
   of socially disinhibited behavior for use in a population of individuals
   with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: Participants were twenty-two
   adults with severe TBI (mean age = 50.45 years) and 21 healthy
   comparison participants (mean age = 45.29 years). Ratings of observed
   social disinhibition were correlated with the disinhibition domain
   scores of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Disinhibition (NPI-D) and with
   Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS) scores. A regression
   analysis was undertaken to determine whether formal measures of
   disinhibition could predict observed disinhibition. Results: The
   interrater absolute agreement for the social disinhibition ratings was
   good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = .69. Participants with
   TBI were rated as significantly more disinhibited than comparison
   participants, t(25.05) = -2.07, p = .049. The ratings were positively
   correlated with the NPI frequency score (r = .45, p = .038) and distress
   score (r = .45, p = .035). The ratings were not related to change in
   employment or in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS, and formal
   measures of disinhibition were unable to predict observed social
   disinhibition. Conclusions: This study demonstrates good interrater
   reliability and construct validity of the observational measure. The
   results evidence the usefulness of this measure and the NPI-D for
   detecting social disinhibition after TBI.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{173-178}},
Abstract = {{Background: An elevated troponin level is commonly found in asymptomatic
   patients on hemodialysis (HD) and is associated with higher risk of
   mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. The underlying
   mechanism for the association between adverse outcomes and elevated
   troponin levels has not been elucidated. Methods: Two hundred thirty-six
   stable chronic HD patients from 2 tertiary care centers were enrolled in
   this study. We measured pre-dialysis troponin I levels with routine
   monthly bloods for 3 consecutive months. Troponin I was considered to be
   elevated if it exceeded the laboratory reference range of 0.06 mu g/l.
   Results: The study population had a mean age of 67.5, 56\% were male,
   47\% had diabetes and 28\% had pre-existing coronary artery disease.
   Eighty-eight positive troponin values were recorded (13\% of the
   available values) in 52 patients. In a repeated measures linear random
   effects model (univariate analysis), high ultrafiltration (UF), high
   inter-dialytic weight gain, and duration of the dialysis session, but
   not intra-dialytic hypotension, were associated with troponin I
   elevation. In the multivariate model, only high UF explained troponin I
   elevation (p = 0.04). The intraclass correlation coefficient was found
   to be 5.8\%, suggesting that observed variability is within and not
   between subjects, with session-related parameters being more important
   than inter-individual differences. Conclusions: A high UF rate during HD
   is associated with a biochemical evidence of myocardial injury. If
   confirmed, efforts to avoid rapid UF, protect residual kidney function
   or minimize weight gain between sessions may impact cardiovascular
   outcomes in this high-risk population. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Within a population, individuals can often exhibit consistent
   differences in a range of behaviors across time and context (behavioral
   type) that are also correlated (behavioral syndrome). Recently, it has
   been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its
   probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result,
   certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a
   non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications-from
   the way we conduct ecological research to the management and
   conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable?
   Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of
   passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival
   and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are
   typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in
   similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different
   trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing)
   in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a
   population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested
   whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant
   behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no
   difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5
   behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral
   syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an
   environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We
   suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be
   associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of
   animals to novelty.}},

Abstract = {{Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral

   guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can
   behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely
   more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant
   temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred
   thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed
   individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food
   intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we
   demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on
   behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently
   affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these
   factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e.,
   multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert
   multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of
   individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food

Abstract = {{The temperament of ewes and maternal behaviour at lambing has been
   implicated as contributing factors to lamb survival. Some 14 054 records
   of maternal behaviour score (MBS, 1 = good, 5 = poor) were collected at
   lamb tagging from 32 breeds of sheep over several years in a variety of
   environments. Records for two objectively scored temperament traits,
   flight time from a weighing crate (FT) and agitation score in an
   isolation box test (IBT) were available on 19 151 and 17 159 animals,
   respectively. These data were pooled from three sources, which included
   research and commercial ram breeding flocks. The combined data were also
   split into three subsets based on breed groups (Merino, Maternal and
   Terminal) for analyses. Records of weights and number of lambs weaned
   (NLW), as well as pedigree information was available from the national
   genetic evaluation database. The heritability estimates from the
   combined analyses were 0.20 +/- 0.02 for MBS, 0.18 +/- 0.02 for FT and
   0.26 +/- 0.02 for IBT, with a repeatability of 0.24 +/- 0.01 for MBS.
   There were some small differences between the breed groups in the
   heritability estimates. The genetic correlations between FT and MBS were
   negative (favourable) and consistent across the datasets (-0.47 +/-
   0.12, combined analysis). The genetic correlations between IBT and MBS
   were positive (favourable) but not significant (0.12 +/- 0.11, combined
   analysis). The genetic correlations between IBT and FT were also
   favourable, but small and generally not significant. There were small
   favourable genetic correlations between MBS and various bodyweights
   (-0.17 +/- 0.07, yearling) and NLW (-0.25 +/- 0.07). However, there were
   no significant genetic relationships between the temperament and
   production traits. The moderate heritability and repeatability of MBS
   indicate maternal behaviour could be improved by selection, and that it
   could be a useful additional trait in breeding programs for improved
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{An animal's susceptibility to risk may be partly dependent on its body
   size. But are larger individuals bolder? We assessed this question by
   measuring time to emerge from a shelter in repeated trials on hatchling
   keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii). Estimates of repeatability of
   emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality
   dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter
   sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially
   influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions.
   Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring
   size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to
   adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences
   in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link
   between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger
   offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as

   boldness levels, made females behave in a less consistent manner, and
   significantly reduced correlations over time and across contexts.
   Fluoxetine exerted its effects on female Betta splendens behavior in a
   dose-dependent fashion and these effects persisted even after females
   were housed in clean water. If fluoxetine exposure impacts behaviors

Abstract = {{The GreenFeed Emission Monitoring system was used to measure individual
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while recording feed intake of beef
   heifers. That technique provides spot-measures of methane (CH4) and
   carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at each visit to the GreenFeed feeder. A
   sampling variance is attached at each spot-measure due to circadian
   variation in GHG emission. Averaging spot-measures is required for
   reducing that sampling error when evaluating GHG emissions of individual
   cattle. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the length of
   test period and number of spot-measures for precisely assessing
   differences among beef heifers. The within-individual (sigma(2)r) and
   across-individual (sigma(2)i) variances of GHG-flux measures were
   estimated for 124 Charolais beef heifers fed a roughage diet during an
   8-week test period, following 3-4 weeks of adaptation. High
   repeatability coefficients (>0.77) were obtained with 4-week test
   averages and similar to 100 spot-measures for CH4 and CO2 fluxes.
   Equivalent repeatability was obtained for dry matter intake (DMI). Lower
   repeatability (<0.7) was obtained for combined traits, namely, CH4/CO2,
   CH4/DMI and CO2/DMI. Higher precision would have been obtained if the
   first 2 weeks were not used but considered as further adaptation. In
   that case, about 50 spot-measures recorded during a 2-week test would be
   sufficient for a precise individual measure of CH4 emissions. For
   genetic evaluation, test duration of 5 weeks may be recommended for the
   simultaneous recording of CH4 emission and feed intake.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{58-65}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fact that physiological parameters in dressage are important
   because of their close connection to human-horse accidents, performance
   and welfare, these parameters are only rarely included in horse breeding
   programs. In Spain, the Pura Raza Espanol horse (PRE) Breeding Program
   focuses mainly on the selection of horses for satisfactory dressage
   ability. Studying the genetic parameters of eye temperature (ET) using
   infrared thermography (IR) as an indicator of stress in horses could
   highlight the suitability of this parameter to be included as a
   selection criterion in the PRE Breeding Program. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the heritability of ET measured with IR in Young
   Horse Dressage tests (YHDT) from the Breeding Program. Accordingly, 343
   PRE were measured during 3 YHDT final competitions held in Spain. From
   these animals, 1746 ET measurements were taken on 3 different moments
   during each competition: 3 h before the competition (ET\_B), just after
   the competition (<5 min after the dressage exercise) (ET\_JA), and 3 h
   after the competition, when the animal was resting (ET\_A). Moreover, 6
   different dressage score records were taken for each animal during the
   competitions: walk, trot, canter, general impression, submission and
   total score. The genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian
   procedure. The environmental effects (Age, Stud, Trip, Training,
   Event-Year and Rider) that were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for
   each temperature trait were used in the genetic models. The pedigree
   file included a total of 3350 PRE. The correlations between the ET and
   expected breeding values for dressage (EBV), as well as the coincidence
   between the animals' genetic rankings by their EBV, were also studied.
   Heritabilities for temperature traits ranged from 0.14 (ET\_JA) to 0.50
   (ET\_A), while heritabilities for performance traits ranged from 0.44
   (walk) to 0.37 (submission) and repeatability ranged from 0.25 (ET\_JA)
   to 0.79 (walk). The dressage EBV and the ET EBV just after exercise
   showed statistically significant correlations with r(2) = 0.21. Finally,
   the range of matching animals was higher (from 17\% to 40\%) when the
   top 25\% of the animals for both parameters was selected. Our findings
   indicate that the selection of the best animals for dressage performance
   would also involve selecting the animals with higher ET values, showing
   a higher level of physiological stress. Hence, despite selection using
   ET in horses is achievable, more evidence about its validity,
   sensitivity and specificity is still needed in order to include ET as an
   additional selection criteria in Breeding Programs. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{The identification of genes associated with ecologically important
   traits provides information on the potential genetic mechanisms
   underlying the responses of an organism to its natural environment. In
   this study, we investigated the genetic basis of host plant resistance
   to the gall-inducing aphid, Pemphigus betae, in a natural population of
   154 narrowleaf cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia). We surveyed genetic
   variation in two genes putatively involved in sink-source relations and
   a phenology gene that co-located in a previously identified quantitative
   trait locus for resistance to galling. Using a candidate gene approach,
   three major findings emerged. First, natural variation in tree
   resistance to galling was repeatable. Sampling of the same tree
   genotypes 20 years after the initial survey in 1986 show that 80\% of
   the variation in resistance was due to genetic differences among
   individuals. Second, we identified significant associations at the
   single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype levels between the plant
   neutral invertase gene NIN1 and tree resistance. Invertases are a class
   of sucrose hydrolyzing enzymes and play an important role in plant
   responses to biotic stress, including the establishment of nutrient
   sinks. These associations with NIN1 were driven by a single nucleotide
   polymorphism (NIN1\_664) located in the second intron of the gene and in
   an orthologous sequence to two known regulatory elements. Third,
   haplo-types from an inhibitor of invertase (C/VIF1) were significantly
   associated with tree resistance. The identification of genetic variation
   in these two genes provides a starting point to understand the possible
   genetic mechanisms that contribute to tree resistance to gall formation.
   We also build on previous work demonstrating that genetic differences in
   sink-source relationships of the host influence the ability of P. betae
   to manipulate the flow of nutrients and induce a nutrient sink. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species often consistently differ in their
   behaviour across time and context. These stable differences are usually
   termed `animal personality'. Parasitism is known to significantly
   influence the evolution of animal personality at least in part because
   more explorative individuals may meet parasites more frequently than
   less explorative ones. Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent
   individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be
   measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship
   between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in
   a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more
   explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally
   significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and
   more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we
   experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any
   alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship
   between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not
   induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become
   more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at
   the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and
   exploration) were repeatable. Furthermore, firebugs with a stronger
   immune response behaved more boldly but also less actively. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: To examine the reliability of heart rate variability (HRV)
   parameters in adolescents and to analyse the inter-and intra-observer
   reliability of data analysis.
   Methods: The sample included 27 adolescents aged 14-19 years old. RR
   intervals were obtained for 10 min in the supine position on two
   different days (Day 1 and Day 8) with an interval of 7 days to analyse
   intra-individual reliability. The signals obtained on Day 1 were used to
   analyse the inter-and intra-observer reliability of HRV parameters. The
   RR intervals, standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDNN), root mean
   square of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals
   (RMSSD), the percentage of adjacent intervals over 50 ms (PNN50), and
   low (LF) and high (HF) frequencies were obtained. Frequency-domain
   variables were analysed using the autoregressive (AR) and fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) methods.
   Results: There were no intra-individuals difference in RR intervals
   between Day 1 and Day 8 (P>0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC) ranged from 0.647 to 0.913, whereas the coefficient of variation
   (CV) was lower than 20\% for all parameters, except PNN50 and LF/HF. The
   inter-and intra-observer reliability ranged from 0.915 to 0.996 and
   0.990 to 0.993, respectively. In addition, the CV was lower than 20\%
   (inter-observer) and 7\% (intra-observer) to all HRV parameters.
   Conclusion: Indicators of reproducibility obtained in this study suggest
   that HRV can be used in adolescents; however, the analysis of HRV
   parameters should be performed by the same person.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The goal of this study was to modify the transpalatal arch
   design that is used for vertical control of the molars, based on
   individual muscle strength and morphology features of the tongue during
   swallowing. Methods: Individual Silastic (Muller-Omicron, Cologne,
   Germany) swallowing tongue records were created and measured for 32
   healthy volunteers. The transpalatal arches were modified by adding
   acrylic pads, based on the swallowing tongue records. Tongue pressure
   exerted on the hard palate and the acrylic pads at 3 distances to the
   palatal mucosa during swallowing was measured by pressure sensors for 18
   subjects. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient of the
   thickness of swallowing tongue records taken by 2 researchers was 0.977,
   indicating good consistency between these researchers. A significant
   negative correlation was found between the thickness of the swallowing
   tongue records and individual tongue pressure (r = -0.511; P<0.01).
   Tongue pressure exerted on the fabricated pads consistent with
   swallowing tongue records was significantly higher than on the hard
   palate, yet not significantly higher than tongue pressure exerted on the
   pads positioned 3 mm closer to the palatal mucosa. In contrast,
   increasing the distance of the pad 3 mm away from the mucosa led to
   significant augmentation of tongue pressure. Conclusions: Creating
   patient swallowing tongue records is a repeatable and reliable method to
   reflect individual differences in morphologic features and muscle
   strengths of the tongue. Decreasing the distance of the pads to the
   mucosa is preferable if a high force to intrude molars will not be used.
   On the premise of a patient's tolerance, increasing the distance of the
   pads away from the mucosa leads to augmentation of tongue force.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Acromegaly is frequently associated with altered facial
   appearance at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, acromegaly is also
   associated with adverse psychological outcomes. We conducted a
   single-centre, cross-sectional study comparing patients with growth
   hormone vs non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFA) to assess the
   association between morphometric changes and psychological outcomes and
   illness perception of patients with acromegaly.
   Methods: A seven-step scale was developed to grade morphometric changes
   based on facial photographs. In addition, all patients were asked to
   drawan image of their own body and an image of what they considered to
   be an average healthy body and complete seven psychological
   questionnaires. We recruited 55 consecutive patients in each of the two
   groups who had undergone surgery with or without radiation therapy (RT).
   Results: Our data showed that the clinician-ratedmorphometric scale was
   highly reliable in assessing facial changes, with 93/99 (Intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.95 (0.93-0.97)) graded as similar by

   Conclusions: Our study demonstratesa correlation between physical
   changes associated with acromegaly and poor psychological outcomes,

Title = {{Variation at the DRD4 locus is associated with wariness and local site
   selection in urban black swans}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interactions between wildlife and humans are increasing.
   Urban animals are often less wary of humans than their non-urban
   counterparts, which could be explained by habituation, adaptation or
   local site selection. Under local site selection, individuals that are
   less tolerant of humans are less likely to settle in urban areas.
   However, there is little evidence for such temperament-based site
   selection, and even less is known about its underlying genetic basis. We
   tested whether site selection in urban and non-urban habitats by black
   swans (Cygnus atratus) was associated with polymorphisms in two genes
   linked to fear in animals, the dopamine receptor D-4 (DRD4) and
   serotonin transporter (SERT) genes.
   Results: Wariness in swans was highly repeatable between disturbance
   events (repeatability = 0.61) and non-urban swans initiated escape from
   humans earlier than urban swans. We found no inter-individual variation
   in the SERT gene, but identified five DRD4 genotypes and an association
   between DRD4 genotype and wariness. Individuals possessing the most
   common DRD4 genotype were less wary than individuals possessing rarer
   genotypes. As predicted by the local site selection hypothesis,
   genotypes associated with wary behaviour were over three times more
   frequent at the non-urban site. This resulted in moderate population
   differentiation at DRD4 (F-ST = 0.080), despite the sites being
   separated by only 30 km, a short distance for this highly-mobile
   species. Low population differentiation at neutrally-selected
   microsatellite loci and the likely occasional migration of swans between
   the populations reduces the likelihood of local site adaptations.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that wariness in swans is partly
   genetically-determined and that wary swans settle in less-disturbed
   areas. More generally, our findings suggest that site-specific
   management strategies may be necessary that consider the temperament of
   local animals.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1462-1473}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Evolutionary ecologists increasingly study reaction norms that are
   expressed repeatedly within the same individual's lifetime. For example,
   foragers continuously alter anti-predator vigilance in response to
   moment-to-moment changes in predation risk. Variation in this form of
   plasticity occurs both among and within individuals. Among-individual
   variation in plasticity (individual by environment interaction or I x E)
   is commonly studied; by contrast, despite increasing interest in its
   evolution and ecology, within-individual variation in phenotypic
   plasticity is not.
   2. We outline a study design based on repeated measures and a multilevel
   extension of random regression models that enables quantification of
   variation in reaction norms at different hierarchical levels (such as
   among and within individuals). The approach enables the calculation of
   repeatability of reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes
   (level of phenotypic plasticity); these indices are not specific to
   measurement or scaling and are readily comparable across data sets.
   3. The proposed study design also enables calculation of repeatability
   at different temporal scales (such as short-and long-term
   repeatability), thereby answering calls for the development of
   approaches enabling scale-dependent repeatability calculations.
   4. We introduce a simulation package in the R statistical language to
   assess power, imprecision and bias for multilevel random regression that
   may be utilised for realistic data sets (unequal sample sizes across
   individuals, missing data, etc). 5. We apply the idea to a worked
   example to illustrate its utility. We conclude that consideration of
   multilevel variation in reaction norms deepens our understanding of the
   hierarchical structuring of labile characters and helps reveal the
   biology in heterogeneous patterns of within-individual variance that
   would otherwise remain `unexplained' residual variance.}},

Abstract = {{While the number of studies reporting the presence of individual
   behavioral consistency (animal personality, behavioral syndrome) has
   boomed in the recent years, there is still much controversy about the
   proximate and ultimate mechanisms resulting in the phenomenon. For
   instance, direct environmental effects during ontogeny (phenotypic
   plasticity) as the proximate mechanism behind the emergence of
   consistent individual differences in behavior are usually overlooked
   compared to environmental effects operating across generations (genetic
   adaptation). Here, we tested the effects of sociality and perceived
   predation risk during ontogeny on the strength of behavioral consistency
   in agile frog (Rana dalmatina) tadpoles in a factorial common garden
   experiment. Tadpoles reared alone and without predatory cues showed zero
   repeatability within (i.e., lack of personality) and zero correlation
   between (i.e., lack of syndrome) activity and risk-taking. On the other
   hand, cues from predators alone induced both activity and risk-taking
   personalities, while cues from predators and conspecifics together
   resulted in an activity - risk-taking behavioral syndrome. Our results
   show that individual experience has an unequivocal role in the emergence
   of behavioral consistency. In this particular case, the development of
   behavioral consistency was most likely the result of genotype 9

Number = {{A}},

Abstract = {{Although consistent individual-level differences in behaviour are
   widespread and potentially important in evolutionary and ecological
   processes, relatively few studies focus on the physiological mechanisms
   that might underlie and regulate these individual-level differences in
   wild populations. We conducted experiments to determine whether
   checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected
   from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove
   creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level
   differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated
   predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response
   to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance
   traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented
   stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study
   was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the
   laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested
   whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter
   individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found
   that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in
   personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a
   response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the
   lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of
   startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing
   performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming
   performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek
   of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not
   modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal
   that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and
   performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and
   physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not
   necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual
   performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural
   enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between
   exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these
   fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may
   underlie the behaviours and performance tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{According to the coping styles hypothesis, an individual demonstrates an
   integrated behavioural and physiological response to environmental
   challenge that is consistent over time and across situations. Individual
   consistency in behavioural responses to challenge has been documented
   across the animal kingdom. Comparatively few studies, however, have
   examined inter-individual variation in the physiological response,
   namely glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels, the stress hormones
   secreted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic
   nervous system, respectively. Variation in coping styles between
   individuals may be explained in part by differences in social rank and
   sex. Using 20 Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrota) we: (1) investigated the
   existence of consistent inter-individual variation in exploratory
   behaviour and the hormonal stress response, and tested for correlations
   as predicted by the coping styles hypothesis; and (2) evaluated whether
   inter-individual behavioural and hormonal variation is related to social
   rank and sex. Salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase,
   chromogranin A) were assessed in the presence and absence of a stressor
   consisting of social isolation in a crate for 10 min. Principal
   components analysis on a set of behavioural variables revealed two
   traits, which we labelled exploratory tendency and neophobia. Neither
   exploratory tendency nor neophobia predicted the physiological stress
   response. Subordinate pigs exhibited higher catecholamine levels
   compared to dominant conspecifics. We observed sex differences in the
   repeatability of salivary stress markers and reactivity of the stress
   systems. The results do not provide support for the existence of
   behavioural physiological coping styles in pigs. Sex is an important
   determinant of the physiological stress response and warrants
   consideration in research addressing behavioural and hormonal variation.

Abstract = {{Behaviours are the result of the interaction between genetic factors,
   past experiences, and labile environmental and social influences.
   Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than
   the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts.
   This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and
   is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness
   and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem
   to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore,
   personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the
   task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are
   expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better
   to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we
   report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a
   period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a
   spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both
   in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not
   differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower
   cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than
   slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds
   successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet,
   fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task,
   potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage
   earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with
   recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or
   proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the
   habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the
   reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the
   personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments. (C) 2015 The

Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{163-169}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences
   in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological,
   metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in
   part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the
   phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental
   sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the
   hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory
   propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta
   domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field
   behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether
   among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour
   and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable,
   but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits.
   Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits
   covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate.
   Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory
   propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary
   change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which
   selection can act more rapidly. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Background: Reciprocal social behavior (RSB) is a developmental
   prerequisite for social competency, and deficits in RSB constitute a
   core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although clinical
   screeners categorically ascertain risk of ASD in early childhood, rapid
   methods for quantitative measurement of RSB in toddlers are not yet
   established. Such measurements are critical for tracking developmental
   trajectories and incremental responses to intervention. Methods: We
   developed and validated a 20-min video-referenced rating scale, the
   video-referenced rating of reciprocal social behavior (vrRSB), for
   untrained caregivers to provide standardized ratings of quantitative
   variation in RSB. Parents of 252 toddler twins {[}Monozygotic (MZ) = 31
   pairs, Dizygotic (DZ) = 95 pairs] ascertained through birth records,
   rated their twins' RSB at two time points, on average 6 months apart,
   and completed two developmental measures, the Modified Checklist for
   Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the MacArthur Communicative Development
   Inventory Short Form (MCDI-s). Results: Scores on the vrRSB were fully
   continuously distributed, with excellent 6-month test-retest reliability
   ({[}intraclass correlation coefficient] ICC = 0.704, p < .000). MZ twins
   displayed markedly greater trait concordance than DZ twins, (MZ ICC =
   0.863, p < .000, DZ ICC = 0.231, p < .012). VrRSB score distributions
   were highly distinct for children passing versus failing the M-CHAT (t =
   -8.588, df = 31, p < .000), incrementally improved from 18-24 months,
   and were inversely correlated with receptive and expressive vocabulary
   on the MCDI-s. Conclusions: Like quantitative autistic trait ratings in
   school-aged children and adults, toddler scores on the vrRSB are
   continuously distributed and appear highly heritable. These ratings
   exhibited minimal measurement error, high inter-individual stability,
   and developmental progression in RSB as children matured from 18-24
   months, supporting their potential utility for serially quantifying the
   severity of early autistic syndromes over time and in response to
   intervention. In addition, these findings inform the
   genetic-environmental structure of RSB in early typical development.}},

Pages = {{217-226}},

Abstract = {{The current study used a multifaceted approach to assess whether
   children with ASD have a distinctive diurnal rhythm of cortisol that
   differentiates them from typically developing (TD) peers and whether
   sub-groups of ASD children can be identified with unique diurnal
   profiles. Salivary cortisol was sampled at four time points during the
   day (waking, 30-min post-waking, afternoon, and evening) across three
   days in a sample of 36 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
   27 typically developing (TD) peers. Between-group comparisons on both
   mean levels and featural components of diurnal cortisol indicated
   elevated evening cortisol and a dampened linear decline across the day
   in the ASD group. No differences were evident on the cortisol awakening
   response (CAR). Group-based trajectory modeling indicated that a
   subgroup (25\%) of ASD children demonstrated an attenuated linear
   decline while the cortisol trajectory of the second subgroup was
   indistinguishable from that of the TD group. Intraclass correlations
   indicated that, when aggregated across days, cortisol measures were
   generally stable over the interval assessed. There were few significant
   relations between cortisol measures or sub-groups and measures of
   stress, temperament, and symptoms. Results encourage follow-up studies
   to investigate the functional significance, heterogeneity and
   longer-term stability of diurnal cortisol profiles in children with ASD.

Abstract = {{When mean behaviors correlate among individuals, they form behavioral
   syndromes. One way to understand the evolution of such a group-level
   phenomenon is to compare horizontally patterns of correlations among
   populations (or species) or follow longitudinally the same population
   over years in the light of parallel differences in the environment. We
   applied the longitudinal approach to 8-year field data and analyzed
   phenotypic correlations, and their within- and between-individual
   components, among three behaviors (novelty avoidance, aggression, and
   risk-taking) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, in a
   meta-analytic framework. The phenotypic correlation between novelty
   avoidance and aggression varied heterogeneously (it was positive in some
   years, while it was negative in other years), while the other pair-wise
   correlations were consistently positive over the study period. We
   investigated four potential socio-ecological factors, and found evidence
   that the among-year alterations in the demographic structure of the
   population (density, age composition) can be responsible for the
   heterogeneous effect sizes. Comparing within- and between-individual
   correlations across pairs of traits, we found that the correlation
   between aggression and risk-taking at the among-individual level was the
   strongest suggesting that this relationship has the highest potential to
   form a behavioral syndrome. Within-year repeatabilities varied among
   traits, but were systematically higher than between-year
   repeatabilities. Our study highlights on an empirical basis that there
   can be several biological and statistical reasons behind detecting a
   phenotypic correlation in a study, but only few of these imply that
   fixed behavioral syndromes are maintained in a natural population. In
   fact, some correlations seem to be shaped by environmental fluctuations.}},

   higher ICCs (similar to 0.86-0.96) between sessions compared to the
   assessment of spectral power change (similar to 0.61-0.82). Our data

Abstract = {{Background: Translation of transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS) from research to clinical practice is hindered by a lack of
   consensus on optimal stimulation parameters, significant
   inter-individual variability in response, and in sufficient
   intra-individual reliability data.
   Objectives: Inter-individual differences in response to anodal tDCS at a
   range of current intensities were explored. Intra-individual reliability
   in response to anodal tDCS across two identical sessions was also
   investigated.
   Methods: Twenty-nine subjects participated in a crossover study.
   Anodal-tDCS using four different current intensities (0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2
   mA), with an anode size of 16 cm(2), was tested. The 0.5 mA condition
   was repeated to assess intra-individual variability. TMS was used to
   elicit 40 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) before 10 min of tDCS, and 20
   MEPs at four time-points over 30 min following tDCS.
   Results: ANOVA revealed no main effect of TIME for all conditions except
   the first 0.5 mA condition, and no differences in response between the
   four current intensities. Cluster analysis identified two clusters for
   the 0.2 and 2 mA conditions only. Frequency distributions based on
   individual subject responses (excitatory, inhibitory or no response) to
   each condition indicate possible differential responses between
   individuals to different current intensities. Test-retest reliability
   was negligible (ICC(2,1) = -0.50).
   Conclusions: Significant inter-individual variability in response to
   tDCS across a range of current intensities was found. 2 mA and 0.2 mA
   tDCS were most effective at inducing a distinct response. Significant
   intra-individual variability in response to tDCS was also found. This

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Assess the short-and long-term stability of sleep
   duration in patients with insomnia and normal-sleeping controls.
   Design: Observational short-term and prospective studies.
   Setting: Sleep laboratory.
   Participants: Patients with insomnia (n = 150) and controls (n = 151)
   were recruited from the local community or sleep disorders clinic. A
   subsample of 95 men from the Penn State Adult Cohort (PSAC) were
   followed up 2.6 y after their initial visit.
   Measurements: Participants underwent a physical examination and 8-h
   polysomnography (PSG) recording for 3 consecutive nights (controls and
   insomniacs), or 2 single nights separated by several years (PSAC).
   Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) assessed the stability of the
   variables total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake
   after sleep onset (WASO). We also examined persistence of the
   first-night classification of ``short{''} versus ``normal{''} sleep
   duration on subsequent nights.
   Results: Stability of TST, SOL, and WASO based on 1 night were slight to
   moderate in both patients with insomnia (ICC = 0.37-0.57) and controls
   (ICC = 0.39-0.59), and became substantial to almost perfect when based
   on the average of 3 nights (ICC = 0.64-0.81). We observed similar
   degrees of stability for TST and WASO in the longitudinal sample, with
   moderate stability based on a single night and substantial stability
   based on both nights. In examining the persistence of ``short{''} and
   ``normal{''} sleep duration, 71.4\% (controls), 74.7\% (patients with
   insomnia), and 72.6\% (longitudinal sample) of participants retained
   their first-night classifications over subsequent nights.
   Conclusions: Sleep duration variables, particularly total sleep time
   based on 3 consecutive nights in both patients with insomnia and
   controls or two single-night recordings separated by several years, are
   stable and reflect a person's habitual sleep. Furthermore, a single
   night in the laboratory may be useful for reliably classifying one's

Abstract = {{The presence of a few highly influential individuals, so called

   foraging aggressiveness, demonstrating that adults indeed act as
   keystone individuals in juvenile spider groups. Interestingly, the
   magnitude of their positive impact on collective foraging was mediated
   by group size: adult presence shortened latency to attack prey more
   strongly in large groups than in small groups. Conversely, adult
   presence increased the number of attackers only in small groups.
   Surprisingly, intergroup variation in collective foraging, which is
   known to be consistent in mature social spiders, was not repeatable in
   juvenile groups. Thus, juvenile groups seem to behave more erratically
   or need more time to develop collective personalities. Together, our
   results suggest that adult presence can have profound, catalytic effects
   on juvenile collective foraging behaviour, and that these effects are
   modulated by group size. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency is a key assumption when evaluating how
   between-individual differences in behaviour influence life history
   tactics. Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural
   repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural
   repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have
   investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status
   (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed
   to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the
   repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to
   human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at
   both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural
   trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly
   between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males
   than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual
   variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with
   individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life
   history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report
   here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{A clinically applicable and accurate method for measuring Achilles
   tendon length is needed to investigate the influence of elongation of
   the Achilles tendon after acute rupture. The purpose of this study was
   to develop and validate an ultrasonographic (US) length measurement of
   the Achilles tendon-aponeurosis complex.
   Both legs of 19 non-injured subjects were examined by magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) and US. The length from calcaneus to the medial head of m.
   Gastrocnemius was measured by three independent US examiners. Repeated
   US measurements were performed and compared to MRI measurements.
   Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and the agreement between MRI
   and US were determined. Data were evaluated using the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of the measurement
   (SEM) and the minimal detectable change (MDC).
   Intra-rater reliability of US assessment showed no significant
   differences between test days: ICC 0.96, SEM 4 mm and MDC 10 mm.
   Inter-rater reliability showed a systematic difference between US
   observers of 2-5 mm (p = 0.001-0.036); ICC 0.97, SEM 3 mm and MDC 9 mm.
   MRI measurements were on average 4 mm longer than US (p = 0.001).
   The novel ultrasound measurement showed good reliability and accuracy.
   For comparison between groups of non-injured subjects differences of
   more than 4 mm can be detected. For repeated assessment of individual
   subjects differences of more than 10 mm can be detected. The measurement
   needs to be further assessed in the setting of acute Achilles tendon
   rupture.
   This new ultrasound measurement might allow for length measurement of
   ruptured Achilles tendons in the acute and chronic state after rupture.

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the long-term stability of sleep duration, sleep
   continuity, and sleep architecture assessed via unattended home sleep
   electroencephalography (EEG) during middle childhood.
   Methods: A total of 69 healthy children (18 girls and 51 boys) aged 8.2
   years (standard deviation = 1.3 years) at T1 underwent unattended home
   sleep EEG on two nights separated by 18.5 months (standard deviation =
   3.9 months). Of the children, 34 (49.3\%) children were born prematurely
   (< 32 gestational weeks; mean birth weight = 1367 g) and 35 (50.7\%)
   children were born at term (mean birth weight = 3275 g).
   Results: We found moderate to substantial stability (all p < 0.001) for
   total sleep time (TST; intraclass correlation coefficient {[}ICC] =
   0.65), slow wave sleep (SWS; min, \%: ICC = 0.49), and stage 2 sleep
   (min; ICC = 0.47), and found fair stability (all p < 0.013) for sleep
   efficiency (ICC = 0.28), nocturnal awakenings (ICC = 0.33), stage 2
   sleep (\%; ICC = 0.32), and rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep (min: ICC =
   0.33; \%: ICC = 0.27). Prematurity status was not associated with
   stability of sleep EEG indices over time.
   Conclusions: Long-term follow-up of one night of unattended home sleep
   EEG during middle childhood reveals that TST, stage 2 sleep, and SWS are
   relatively stable, trait-like characteristics. This applies less
   strongly for sleep efficiency, nocturnal awakenings, and REM sleep.
   Stage 1 sleep and REM latency showed no stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in animal social networks, surprisingly little
   is known about whether individuals are consistent in their social
   network characteristics. Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an
   assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made
   when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and
   structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore
   vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for
   individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and
   ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here,
   we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large
   PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network
   metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then
   examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to
   week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in
   repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were
   significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest
   repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a
   measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for
   the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show
   that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by
   within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected
   fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare
   evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals.
   Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have
   important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their
   social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf of

Title = {{Post-illumination pupil response after blue light: Reliability of
   optimized melanopsin-based phototransduction assessment}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{73-80}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells have recently been shown
   highly relevant to the non-image forming effects of light, through their
   direct projections on brain circuits that regulate alertness, mood and
   circadian rhythms. A quantitative assessment of functionality of the
   melanopsin-signaling pathway could be highly relevant in order to
   mechanistically understand individual differences in the effects of
   light on these regulatory systems. We here propose and validate a
   reliable quantification of the melanopsin-dependent Post-Illumination
   Pupil Response (PIPR) after blue light, and evaluated its sensitivity to
   dark adaptation, time of day, body posture, and light exposure history.
   Pupil diameter of the left eye was continuously measured during a series
   of light exposures to the right eye, of which the pupil was dilated
   using tropicamide 0.5\%. The light exposure paradigm consisted of the
   following five consecutive blocks of five minutes: baseline dark;
   monochromatic red light (peak wavelength: 630 nm, luminance: 375
   cd/m(2)) to maximize the effect of subsequent blue light; dark;
   monochromatic blue light (peak wavelength: 470 nm, luminance: 375
   cd/m(2)); and post-blue dark. PIPR was quantified as the difference
   between baseline dark pupil diameter and post-blue dark pupil diameter
   (PIPR-mm). In addition, a relative PIPR was calculated by dividing PIPR
   by baseline pupil diameter (PIPR-\%). In total 54 PIPR assessments were
   obtained in 25 healthy young adults (10 males, mean age +/- SD: 26.9 +/-
   4.0 yr). From repeated measurements on two consecutive days in 15 of the
   25 participants (6 males, mean age +/- SD: 27.8 +/- 4.3 yrs) test retest
   reliability of both PIPR outcome parameters was calculated. In the
   presence of considerable between-subject differences, both outcome
   parameters had very high test retest reliability: Cronbach's alpha >
   0.90 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient > 0.85. In 12 of the 25
   participants (6 males, mean age +/- SD: 26.5 +/- 3.6 yr) we examined the
   potential confounding effects of dark adaptation, time of the day
   (morning vs. afternoon), body posture (upright vs. supine position), and
   24-h environmental light history on the PIPR assessment. Mixed effect
   regression models were used to analyze these possible confounders. A
   supine position caused larger PIPR-mm (beta = 0.29 mm, SE = 0.10, p =
   0.01) and PIPR-\% (beta = 4.34\%, SE = 1.69, p = 0.02), which was due to
   an increase in baseline dark pupil diameter; this finding is of
   relevance for studies requiring a supine posture, as in functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging, constant routine protocols, and bed-ridden
   patients. There were no effects of dark adaptation, time of day, and
   light history. In conclusion, the presented method provides a reliable
   and robust assessment of the PIPR to allow for studies on individual
   differences in melanopsin-based phototransduction and effects of
   interventions.(C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator behavior is a key aspect of life history evolution,
   usually studied at the population (mean), or across-individual levels.
   However individuals can also differ in their intra-individual (residual)
   variation, but to our knowledge, this has only been studied once before
   in free-living animals. Here we studied the distances moved and changes
   in nest height and concealment between successive nesting attempts of
   marked pairs of grey fantails (Rhipidura albiscapa) in relation to nest
   fate, across the breeding season. We predicted that females (gender that
   decides where the nest is placed) should on average show adaptive
   behavioral responses to the experience of prior predation risk such that
   after an unsuccessful nesting attempt, replacement nests should be
   further away, higher from the ground, and more concealed compared with
   replacement nests after successful nesting attempts. We found that, on
   average, females moved greater distances to re-nest after unsuccessful
   nesting attempts (abandoned or depredated) in contrast to after a
   successful attempt, suggesting that re-nesting decisions are sensitive
   to risk. We found no consistent across-individual differences in
   distances moved, heights, or concealment. However, females differed by
   53-fold (or more) in their intra-individual variability (i.e.,
   predictability) with respect to distances moved and changes in nest
   height between nesting attempts, indicating that either some systematic
   variation went unexplained and/or females have inherently different
   predictability. Ignoring these individual differences in residual
   variance in our models obscured the effect of nest fate on re-nesting
   decisions that were evident at the mean level.}},

   Quality of Life subscale (P = .027). However, the differences between
   individual time points did not surpass the minimal detectable change for
   the DPA, and no post hoc analyses were significant for the KOOS-Quality
   of Life subscale. Test-retest reliability was moderate for the KOOS-Pain
   subscale (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.71) and good for the
   remaining KOOS subscales, DPA, and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure-Sport
   (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.79). The DPA and KOOS-Sport
   subscale demonstrated a significant moderate relationship (P = .018).
   Conclusions: Athletic participation during a nontraditional, spring
   soccer season did not affect HRQOL. All 3 PROs were reliable and could
   be used clinically to monitor changes in health status throughout an
   athletic season. Our results demonstrate that significant deviations in
   scores were related to factors other than participation, such as injury.
   Finally, both generic and region-specific instruments should be used in
   clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Current fishing extraction methods often generate huge quantities of
   dead or dying biomass that is returned to the sea in the form of
   discards. This practice produces a readily available clumped resource
   for many scavengers such as seabirds, but in the face of declining
   stocks and via policy change, the amount of discards produced is set to
   decline in the future. To understand how discards have influenced
   seabird foraging in the past and how birds may respond to future change
   requires studies examining consistent individual foraging choices. There
   is increasing evidence that populations may be made up of generalist or
   specialist foragers and this is key to the population's ability to adapt
   to change. Here we test for consistent individual foraging behaviour of
   northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to fishing vessels and
   examine consequences of scavenging behaviour in terms of foraging effort
   and body condition. Using a combination of bird-borne bio-logging
   devices (GPS and Time Depth Recorders) with high resolution GPS data
   acquired through vessel monitoring systems on fishing boats, we examined
   the overlap between birds and fisheries. We found that during repeat
   foraging trips in the same breeding season, gannets regularly foraged at
   fishing boats but there were also clear among individual differences in
   the extent of fisheries overlap. Furthermore, we show for the first time
   that these differences represent consistent strategies - individual
   differences in scavenging were highly repeatable across multiple trips
   within a period of several weeks. However, despite this finding, we
   found no differences in foraging effort or body condition between
   scavengers and non-scavengers. Moreover, scavenging strategy did not
   appear to influence diving behaviour or vary by sex. Scavenging on
   discards appears to be a strategy employed consistently by a subsection
   of the population and future work should examine whether these
   specialisations persist throughout and between years and what causes
   these individual differences, exploring possible demographic and fitness
   consequences in light of global changes to fish stocks and fisheries
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral data are notable for presenting challenges to their
   statistical analysis, often due to the difficulties in measuring
   behavior on a quantitative scale. Instead, a range of qualitative
   alternative responses is recorded. These can often be understood as the
   outcome of a sequence of binary decisions. For example, faced by a
   predator, an individual may decide to flee or stay. If it stays, it may
   decide to freeze or display a threat and if it displays a threat, it may
   choose from several alternative forms of display. Here we argue that
   instead of being analyzed using traditional nonparametric statistics or
   a series of separate analyses split by response categories, this kind of
   data can be more holistically analyzed using a generalized linear mixed
   model (GLMM) framework extended to binomial response trees. Originally
   devised for the social sciences to analyze questionnaires with
   multiple-choice answers, this approach can easily be applied to
   behavioral data using existing GLMM software. We illustrate its use with
   2 representative examples: 1) repeatability in the measurement of

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal
   species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across
   time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general
   relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild
   populations, which raises the question as to how variation in
   personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating
   selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute
   to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild
   populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we
   investigated the relationship between individual personality differences
   and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a
   population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences
   considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated
   trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using
   capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a
   1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus
   ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found
   that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food
   availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability.
   Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to
   maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic flexibility in physiological, morphological and behavioural
   traits can allow organisms to cope with environmental challenges. Given
   recent climate change and the degree of habitat modification currently
   experienced by many organisms, it is therefore critical to quantify the
   degree of phenotypic variation present within populations, individual
   capacities to change and what their consequences are for fitness.
   Flexibility in standard metabolic rate (SMR) may be particularly
   important since SMR reflects the minimal energetic cost of living and is
   one of the primary traits underlying organismal performance. SMR can
   increase or decrease in response to food availability, but the
   consequences of these changes for growth rates and other fitness
   components are not well known. We examined individual variation in
   metabolic flexibility in response to changing food levels and its
   consequences for somatic growth in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta).
   SMR increased when individuals were switched to a high food ration and
   decreased when they were switched to a low food regime. These shifts in
   SMR, in turn, were linked with individual differences in somatic growth;
   those individuals that increased their SMR more in response to elevated
   food levels grew fastest, while growth at the low food level was fastest
   in those individuals that depressed their SMR most. Flexibility in
   energy metabolism is therefore a key mechanism to maximize growth rates
   under the challenges imposed by variability in food availability and is
   likely to be an important determinant of species' resilience in the face
   of global change.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in contributions to cooperation can be strikingly
   consistent over time giving rise to alternative cooperative phenotypes
   within animal societies. Following the social niche specialization
   hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social
   conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as
   `breeders' and `nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social
   conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This
   hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual
   differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent
   individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals
   contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little
   to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice
   versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to
   reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less
   to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions
   with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding
   and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and
   `escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found
   significant repeatability of individual contributions to both
   cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of
   individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of
   negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and
   reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across
   lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual
   differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not
   associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and
   cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between
   babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts
   and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are
   generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both
   behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent
   individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. (C)

Abstract = {{Simple Summary: The interchangeable usage of the words
   ``personality{''}, ``temperament{''} and ``behavioral syndromes{''} in
   animal behavior research has often led to confusion. In this paper, we
   devise a framework for describing the behavioral phenomenon,
   betweenindividual/between-population variation, and between/across
   context variation. This framework can be used to give unique definitions
   of the three terms, supported by previous literature, giving clarity
   moving forward in the field of animal behavior.
   Abstract: Ethologists use a variety of terminology such as
   ``personality{''}, ``temperament{''} and `` behavioral syndromes{''}
   almost interchangeably to discuss the phenomenon of individuals within a
   population of animals consistently varying from one another in their
   behavioral responses to stimuli. This interchangeable usage of
   terminology has contributed to confusion within the field of animal
   behavior and limits the study of the phenomenon. Here we use a rapid,
   non-exhaustive and repeatable search strategy literature review to
   investigate where there were unique distinctions between these three
   terms and where there was an overlap in their usage. We identified three
   main areas of confusion in terminology: historical usage which is not
   updated; a lack of precision between different fields of study; and a
   lack of precision between different levels of variation. We propose a
   framework with which to understand and define the terms based on the
   levels of variation ethologists are interested in. Consistent individual
   animal behavioral variation relates to the different structures of
   variation of between-individual/between-population and between and
   across contexts. By formalizing this framework we provide clarity
   between the three terms which can be easily defined and understood.}},

Abstract = {{Speed of processing is impaired in schizophrenia but intact in

   whether deficient processing speed was associated with schizotypy in

   Australian Family Study of Schizophrenia, including 216 (non-clinical)
   adults from the general community, and a reference group with
   schizophrenia spectrum disorder (N=224). Schizotypal traits were
   assessed with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, whilst
   processing speed was assessed with a digit-symbol coding task. Community
   controls had significantly higher digit symbol coding scores than
   patients with psychosis. However, both correlational and hierarchical
   regression analysis indicated a lack of association between
   Cognitive-perceptual, Interpersonal or Disorganized schizotypy traits
   and digit symbol coding performance. Relative to Australian norms there
   was also no evidence of a non-linear decline in coding in high

Abstract = {{Behaviors are highly plastic and one aspect of this plasticity is
   behavioral changes over age. The presence of age-related plasticity in
   behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in
   age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and
   genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for
   quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an
   important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of
   plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability
   (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are
   predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the
   theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely
   to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of
   the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We
   present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of
   individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between
   behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic
   level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a
   process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we
   throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory
   of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it
   presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of
   study in many systems. Empirical work aimed at understanding IxA and GxA

Abstract = {{Behavior of wild vertebrate individuals can vary in response to
   environmental or social factors. Such within-individual behavioral
   variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve
   as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal
   personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and
   social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral
   traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among
   individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating
   among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones
   are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed
   hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether
   hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual's
   phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to
   improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships
   between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will
   determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To
   address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones,
   corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate
   behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate
   on among-individual variation and present examples for how variation in
   corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as
   exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review
   studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness,
   and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At
   the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our
   understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of
   behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to
   characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to
   environments.
   In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships
   between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using
   testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for
   testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these
   models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss
   approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between
   testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm
   approaches might be a fruitful way forward.
   We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm
   approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to
   make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the
   functional implications and the evolution of hormone-behavior
   relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals.
   This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat
   alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the
   mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust
   hormonally-mediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions.}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The development of ethologically meaningful test paradigms
   in young animals is an essential step in the study of the ontogeny of
   animal personality. Here we explore the possibility to integrate
   offspring separation (distress) calls into the study of consistent
   individual differences in behaviour in two species of mammals, the
   domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) and the mound-building mouse (Mus
   spicilegus). Such vocal responses in young mammals are a potentially
   useful test option as they represent an important element of
   mother-offspring communication with strong implications for offspring
   survival. In addition, the neural control of vocalisation is closely
   associated with emotional state.
   Results: We found marked similarities in the pattern of individual
   responses of the young of both species to separation from their mother
   and littermates. In the domestic cat as well as in the mound-building
   mouse, individual differences in the frequency of calls and to a lesser
   extent in locomotor activity were repeatable across age, indicating the
   existence of personality types. Such consistencies across age were also
   apparent when only considering relative individual differences among
   litter siblings. In both species, however, individual patterns of
   vocalisation and locomotor activity were unrelated. This suggests that
   these two forms of behavioural responses to isolation represent
   different domains of personality, presumably based on different
   underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.
   Conclusions: Brief separation experiments in young mammals, and
   particularly the measurement of separation calls, provide a promising
   approach to study the ontogeny of personality traits. Future long-term
   studies are needed to investigate the association of these traits with
   biologically meaningful and potentially repeatable elements of behaviour
   during later life.}},

   This assumption is often made, sometimes tested using short time

   Fearlessness and exploration were the most repeatable traits both within

   but not or only partly within life stages. Boldness was not repeatable.
   Furthermore, we found no evidence for a consistent behavioural syndrome

Title = {{Vulnerability of individual fish to capture by trawling is influenced by

Abstract = {{The harvest of animals by humans may constitute one of the strongest
   evolutionary forces affecting wild populations. ``Vulnerability to
   harvest varies among individuals within species according to behavioural
   phenotypes, but we lack fundamental information regarding the
   physiological mechanisms underlying harvest-induced selection. It is
   unknown, for example, what physiological traits make some individual
   fish more susceptible to capture by commercial fisheries. Active fishing
   methods such as trawling pursue fish during harvest attempts, causing
   fish to use both aerobic steady-state swimming and anaerobic burst-type
   swimming to evade capture. Using simulated trawling procedures with
   schools of wild minnows Phoxinus phoxinus, we investigate two key
   questions to the study of fisheries-induced evolution that have been
   impossible to address using large-scale trawls: (i) are some individuals
   within a fish shoal consistently more susceptible to capture by trawling
   than others?; and (ii) if so, is this related to individual differences
   in swimming performance and metabolism? Results provide the first
   evidence of repeatable variation in susceptibility to trawling that is
   strongly related to anaerobic capacity and swimming ability. Maximum
   aerobic swim speed was also negatively correlated with vulnerability to
   trawling. Standard metabolic rate was highest among fish that were least
   vulnerable to trawling, but this relationship probably arose through
   correlations with anaerobic capacity. These results indicate that
   vulnerability to trawling is linked to anaerobic swimming performance
   and metabolic demand, drawing parallels with factors influencing
   susceptibility to natural predators. Selection on these traits by
   fisheries could induce shifts in the fundamental physiological makeup
   and function of descendent populations.}},

Abstract = {{The Walking While Talking (WWT) dual-task paradigm is a mobility stress
   test that predicts major outcomes, including falls, frailty, disability,
   and mortality in aging. Certain personality traits, such as neuroticism,
   extraversion, and their combination, have been linked to both cognitive
   and motor outcomes. We examined whether individual differences in
   personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion predicted
   dual-task performance decrements (both motor and cognitive) on a WWT
   task in non-demented older adults. We hypothesized that the combined
   effect of high neuroticism-low extraversion would be related to greater
   dual-task costs in gait velocity and cognitive performance in
   non-demented older adults. Participants (N=295; age range,=65-95 years;
   female=164) completed the Big Five Inventory and WWT task involving
   concurrent gait and a serial 7's subtraction task. Gait velocity was
   obtained using an instrumented walkway. The high neuroticism-low
   extraversion group incurred greater dual-task costs (i.e., worse
   performance) in both gait velocity \{95\% confidence interval (CI)
   {[}-17.68 to -3.07]\} and cognitive performance (95\% CI {[}-19.34 to
   -2.44]) compared to the low neuroticism-high extraversion group,
   suggesting that high neuroticism-low extraversion interferes with the
   allocation of attentional resources to competing task demands during the
   WWT task. Older individuals with high neuroticism-low extraversion may
   be at higher risk for falls, mobility decline and other adverse outcomes
   in aging.}},

Abstract = {{While livetrapping is a vital field research tool, it is not a
   completely unbiased method of sampling. Biased trapping arises during
   field endocrinological studies whenever hormone levels or response
   influence the probability of capture of a subject. We repeatedly
   captured wild, free-living adult degus (Octodon degus) from the same
   location over 12 days to determine whether individuals with a certain
   endocrine stress profile were more likely to be captured repeatedly than
   others. We measured baseline cortisol (CORT), stress-induced CORT, and
   negative feedback efficacy via a dexamethasone suppression test in adult
   male and lactating and nonlactating female degus upon initial capture.
   We successfully recaptured approximately half of the degus. None of the
   3 indices of the stress response at initial capture predicted whether a
   degu would be recaptured. However, baseline CORT levels at 1st capture
   had a weak, negative relationship with the number of days between 1st
   and 2nd capture. Because most animals interpret capture and restraint as
   an acute stressor, we also analyzed the effect of recapture on the
   endocrine stress response. Baseline and stress-induced CORT
   concentrations were measured upon each subsequent recapture for up to 5
   total captures. Upon subsequent recaptures, neither stress-induced CORT
   nor baseline CORT changed significantly. Additionally, individual
   stress-induced and baseline CORT titers were repeatable within our
   sample population. These findings suggest that livetrapping does not
   select for animals with certain endocrine stress profiles, and that
   degus fail to habituate to repeated capture and restraint stress.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often report
   experiencing several negative emotions simultaneously, an indicator of
   ``undifferentiated{''} negative affect. The current study examined the
   relationship between undifferentiated negative affect and impulsivity.
   Participants with a current BPD (n = 67) or depressive disorder (DD; n =
   38) diagnosis carried an electronic diary for 28 days, reporting on
   emotions and impulsivity when randomly prompted (up to 6 times per day).
   Undifferentiated negative affect was quantified using momentary
   intraclass correlation coefficients, which indicated how consistently
   negative emotion items were rated across fear, hostility, and sadness
   subscales. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion-level,
   day-level, and across 28 days was used to predict occasion-level
   impulsivity. Multilevel modeling was used to test the hypothesis that
   undifferentiated negative emotion would be a significant predictor of
   momentary impulsivity above and beyond levels of overall negative
   affect. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion and day levels
   were significant predictors of occasion-level impulsivity, but
   undifferentiated negative affect across the 28-day study period was only
   marginally significant. Results did not differ depending on BPD or DD
   status, though individuals with BPD did report significantly greater
   momentary impulsivity and undifferentiated negative affect.
   Undifferentiated negative affect may increase risk for impulsivity among
   individuals with BPD and depressive disorders, and the current data
   suggest that this process can be relatively immediate as well as
   cumulative over the course of a day. This research supports the
   consideration of undifferentiated negative affect as a transdiagnostic
   construct, but one that may be particularly relevant for those with BPD.}},

Title = {{The backtest in pigs revisited - An analysis of intra-situational
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of different behavioural phenotypes in animals (regarding
   temperament and personality) has increasingly attracted the attention of
   scientists dealing with farm animal breeding, management and welfare. As
   part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how
   animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping
   strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993)
   suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature
   contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus,
   referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the
   backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency
   distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample
   of domestic piglets (n = 3555). By using a statistical resampling
   analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the
   behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping
   strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four
   times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26
   days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling
   attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal
   distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal
   distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably
   represents a unimodal distribution with a `ceiling-effect'. The
   intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation
   (r(S)) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r(S) = 0.19-0.45, p < 0.001;
   R = 0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural
   consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not
   show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not
   display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large
   pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural
   parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated
   backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that
   are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual
   dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum
   from active to passive coping behaviour. This means that individuals
   show both behavioural consistency and flexibility in behaviour. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum is unique to an individual

   periods. Three nights of baseline sleep {[}12h time in bed (TIB)]

   Spectral analysis of the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG (C3LM

   0.75 and 16.0Hz. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were
   calculated to assess stable individual differences for baseline and

   all frequencies for baseline and recovery and for baseline and recovery
   combined. These results show that the spectrum of the NREM sleep EEG is
   substantially different among individuals, highly stable within
   individuals and robust to an experimental challenge (i.e. sleep

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: We evaluated the feasibility of using a portable infrared
   thermal camera to quantify the degree of thermal dysregulation (cold
   hands/feet) and test for naturally occurring within-patient skin
   temperature asymmetry in Rett syndrome. PROCEDURES: Infrared thermal
   images were acquired passively from 15 patients (mean age = 13.7 years,
   range 4-47) with clinical diagnoses of Rett. Images were acquired using
   a FLIR T400 infrared thermal camera (still images recorded at 5 Hz,
   resolution of 320 x 240 pixels, thermal sensitivity = 0.05 degrees C;
   capture session lasted approximately 3 minutes). The infrared thermal
   camera was orthogonal to the body part (hands, feet) and positioned
   approximately 1 meter from the skin's surface. RESULTS: There were large
   intraindividual left/right differences in temperature. Seven (47\%) and
   eight (53\%) patients had statistically significant (P < 0.05)
   left/right asymmetries between hands (mean difference = 0.87 degrees C,

   (intraclass correlations 0.97-0.99) on temperatures and selection of
   anatomical regions of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of thermal
   asymmetry may reflect prolonged activity of the sympathetic nervous
   system and individual differences in sympathetic regulation. As clinical
   trials emerge and endpoints are considered, portable infrared thermal
   camera may provide one noninvasive means of evaluating changes in
   sympathetic regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Two classes of explanations for covariation between activity level and
   metabolic rate among conspecifics have been proposed. First,
   individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement
   of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because
   movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second,
   energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual
   activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of
   metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history
   traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential
   relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud
   crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of
   crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine
   metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms
   that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard
   metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both
   activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of
   predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne
   chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was
   repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship,
   individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab
   activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological
   relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to
   activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts
   behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves.
   We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic
   rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of
   considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional
   relationships between individual behavior and energetics.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{201-221}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ecologists have recently begun to recognize sleep as a behaviour that is
   important in animal ecology. The first steps have been taken to
   characterize sleep in free-living birds, but it is unclear to what
   extent these results can be generalized between species. To describe
   sleep behaviour in the wild, we videorecorded great tits, Parus major,
   in their roosting boxes during two consecutive winters and individuals
   in captivity for comparison. Here, we examined endogenous and exogenous
   correlates of sleep behaviour in free-living great tits and addressed
   the potential confounding issues of studying avian sleep in captivity.
   Like that in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, sleep behaviour in great
   tits was strongly related to season, and was affected by sex, age and
   the environment. Although literature suggests relationships between
   sleep and risk-taking behaviours, possibly arising from stable
   differences in physiological state, sleep behaviour appeared to be
   plastic in great tits, and was not predicted by between-individual
   variation in exploratory tendencies. Captive tits initiated sleep later
   than wild individuals, even under natural photoperiodic conditions,
   suggesting that captivity alters timing and duration of sleep in great
   tits. Long-term repeatability in sleep behaviour was low for all
   variables, except morning latency (high repeatability) and evening box
   entry time, evening latency and frequency of awakenings (no detectable
   repeatability). Variation in sleep behaviour may largely represent
   within-individual differences in daily sleep requirements. Our study
   describes how different observable components of sleep are
   intercorrelated by providing evidence for significant within-individual
   correlations between sleep behaviours, which represent the integration
   of plasticity between traits. Consistent with low repeatability, low
   between-individual correlations suggest substantial behavioural
   plasticity in sleep, rather than a correlational structure leading to
   clear sleep `syndromes'. Our study provides quantitative evidence for
   the factors producing phenotypic plasticity in behavioural sleep in an
   ecological context. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes arise when individual behavior is correlated over
   time and/or across environmental contexts, often resulting in
   inter-population behavioral differences. Three main hypotheses have been
   suggested to explain the evolution of behavioral syndromes. The
   constraint hypothesis suggests that behaviors originate from a shared
   mechanism with a strong genetic or physiological basis. In contrast,
   according to the adaptive hypothesis, behavioral syndromes depend on
   specific selective pressures in each environment, and thus should evolve
   when specific behavioral combinations are advantageous. Finally,
   behavioral syndromes can also arise owing to neutral stochastic
   processes. We tested here for variation in the foraging syndromes of
   pit-building antlions originating from different populations along a
   climatic gradient. Although inter-population variation existed in some
   traits, foraging syndromes were similar across populations, supporting
   the constraint hypothesis. These findings suggest that stabilizing
   selection, acting on the foraging behavior of antlions during their
   larval phase, outweighs local selection pressures, resulting in
   ``constraint syndromes.{''} We also explored behavioral repeatability of
   foraging-related traits within and among habitats (natural, novel and
   disturbed habitats), and detected different levels of repeatability: pit
   diameter was more repeatable than response time to prey, followed by
   prey exploitation efficiency. Behavioral repeatability of the same trait
   differed according to context, suggesting that repeatability is a trait
   in itself and should not be considered identical even when studying the
   same behavioral trait.}},

Abstract = {{Predation plays a fundamental role in evolutionary processes, driving
   changes in prey morphology, physiology and behaviour. With organisms
   being increasingly exposed to rapid environmental changes, there is
   growing interest in understanding individual phenotypic plasticity in
   response to changes in predation pressure. Behavioural and physiological
   responses to predator exposure are of particular interest as differences
   in predation pressure are often reflected in correlated suites of
   behavioural and hormonal profiles across populations. Within
   populations, the association between endocrine profiles and behaviour is
   less understood and often lacking. Adopting a reaction norm approach and
   a repeated measures design, we assessed within-population effects of
   changes in perceived predation risk on endocrinology and behaviour in
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly
   exposed subjects to a robotic model predator and assessed their
   behavioural response. The fish showed consistent behavioural profiles
   and were less active and shyer when predation risk was higher. Using
   non-invasive waterborne hormone analysis, we assessed basal cortisol as
   well as the cortisol response to changes in predation risk. Individuals
   showed significantly higher cortisol levels following exposure to the
   model predator. Individual post-predator exposure cortisol was
   repeatable but unrelated to behavioural responses. Accounting for
   between versus within-subject effects, we found that basal cortisol and
   shyness were positively related within individuals, that is individuals
   overall were shyer on days they had higher cortisol levels. We also
   tested if basal testosterone predicted risky behaviour and found no
   evidence for this hypothesis. No individual differences in hormonal or
   behavioural responses to changes in predation risk were found,
   suggesting that individuals are not constrained by their personalities
   in their ability to cope with a potentially harmful threat. Overall, we
   show that individuals of different personalities are equally flexible'
   in their response to changes in predation pressure. Our study offers
   novel insight into consistent individual differences and plasticity in
   hormones and behaviour as well as their interplay within populations.
   Future studies should assess the applicability of these findings to
   other changes in the environment, as well as the effects of social
   context on endocrine and behavioural reaction norms.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent behavioural differences between individuals have far-reaching
   implications for ecology and evolution, including how populations cope
   with increasing anthropogenic changes, notably pesticides. Although
   sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current
   studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to
   ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine
   whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could
   affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural
   correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of
   the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by
   an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post-
   exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the
   individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control
   group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the
   extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations
   between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide
   exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average
   behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23\%
   lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey
   capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide
   clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an
   important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial
   alteration of personality differences even in absence of a
   population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide
   effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high
   variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By
   altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations,
   exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle
   effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect
   biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in
   agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual
   behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on
   non-targeted fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Interindividual behavioural differences, consistent over time and across
   situations, are frequently related to differences in reproductive
   success, susceptibility to disease and competitive ability. The
   behavioural phenotype of a conspecific is likely to affect the outcome
   of a social interaction, so an individual must be able to accurately
   assess behavioural phenotypes in order to optimize behavioural responses
   during mate choice, cooperative relationships and agonistic
   interactions. However, behavioural assessment based on dyadic
   interactions in different contexts can be costly because it may require
   significant time, increase the risk of predation and often necessitates
   special cognitive abilities. Different colour cues are associated with
   different life history strategies in many species, so coloration might
   also correlate with behavioural phenotype. Thus, conspecifics could use
   coloration as a single cue for the mediation of social interactions. We
   investigated the relationship between personality and coloration in the
   monogamous, biparental convict cichlid. This species has black
   melanin-based stripes with interindividual variation in the intensity of
   these stripes. In addition, females have bright orange spots on their
   abdomens. Using repeatable measures of boldness, exploration and
   aggressiveness, we were able to define a behavioural syndrome and
   quantified the behavioural type of each individual. Behavioural types
   were predicted by colour traits. In particular, proactive individuals
   (more aggressive, bolder and quicker to resume behaviour after being
   startled) were more likely to be dark and, among females, have smaller
   orange areas. Our results support the hypothesis that coloration in the
   convict cichlid is related to personality. Thus, coloration could play
   an important role in mediating social interactions, allowing a quick and
   reliable assessment of conspecifics' behavioural types. (C) 2015 The

   ignore time-related change at your peril}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{223-230}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Broad sense repeatability, which refers to the extent to which
   individual differences in trait scores are maintained over time, is of
   increasing interest to researchers studying behavioural or physiological
   traits. Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the
   statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability).
   However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal
   nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by
   showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating
   broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power.
   Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related
   change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect
   estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or
   physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of
   R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability,
   and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies.
   Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile
   traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a
   shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability
   of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits
   are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control
   and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time
   (if present). (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Environmental and Genetic Effects of Reactivity Traits in Ile-de-France
   x Texel Crossbred Lambs}},
Journal = {{ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reactivity in livestock species has been assessed in
   relation to the behavioral reactions of animals, through restrained and
   non-restrained tests. Environmental and genetic parameters for
   reactivity traits have been reported for farm animals, as sheep,
   providing support for the possibility of direct selection. Despite
   evidences, there is little information on how genetic and environmental
   factors affect the expression of reactivity in sheep during and after
   weighing. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the environmental and
   genetic effects of reactivity traits in Ile-de-France x Texel crossbred
   lambs.
   Materials, Methods \& Results: Reactivity traits from 188 Ile-de-France
   x Texel cross lambs, aged between 28 and 110 days-old, were assessed in
   two situations: 1-During weighing: a. vocalization (VOC), b. movement
   (MOV), c. tension (TEN), d. exploratory behavior (EB) and e. ears
   posture (EP), and 2-After exiting the weighing crate, in a chute,
   through: a. gait speed (GS) and b. flight speed (FS) tests. For the
   study of environmental effects the model considered the fixed effects of
   month of assessment, sex and management group and as covariates, the
   linear effects of type of birth, age of dam and age of lamb. The (co)
   variance and genetic parameters were estimated using REML in univariate
   analysis and the direct additive genetic effect was considered in the
   model as a random effect. From all the environmental effects, month of
   assessment was statistically important over all the reactivity traits.
   Similarly, the effects of age of dam and age of lamb were significant
   for almost all variables. The estimates of heritability and
   repeatability for the behavioral variables ranged from low to moderate
   magnitudes, with high standard errors, for VOC: 0.19 +/- 0.17 and 0.15
   +/- 0.05, MOV: 0.21 +/- 0.07 and 0.065 +/- 0.02, TEN: 0.27 +/- 0.19 and
   0.16 +/- 0.13, EB: 0.16 +/- 0.12 and 0.13 +/- 0.03, EP: 0.23 +/- 0.19
   and 0.21 +/- 0.15, GS: 0.22 +/- 0.16 and 0.13 +/- 0.11 and FS: 0.165 +/-
   0.13 and 0.11 +/- 0.06, respectively, indicating low possibility of
   direct selection and lowly repeatable behavioral responses over time.
   Discussion: The results showed the significant influence of type of
   management on the majority of variables, fact that may be explained by
   different management systems to which the animals were subjected, in
   addition to the weaning effect. The absence of significant effect of sex
   on reactivity variables contradicts previous findings, in which males
   were found to be less reactive than females. Regarding the genetic
   parameters, few estimates of heritability for reactivity traits have
   been reported for sheep, mainly assessed in the arena test. Such results
   differ from those obtained in the present study which were lowly and
   moderately heritable, but with high standard errors, probably due to the
   small number of animals and the structure of the relationship matrix.
   The coefficients of repeatability for the evaluated traits during and
   after weighing were also low, thus measurements in the first evaluations
   were relatively poor predictors of the same behavioral responses on
   subsequent situations. Although a relatively small number of animals
   were used in the present study, it was possible to estimate genetic
   parameters for reactivity traits assessed during and after weighing.
   Thus, it is necessary to invest in selection, as reactivity has
   important influence on ease of handling and animal welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Examining the relevance of `animal personality' involves linking
   consistent among- and within-individual behavioural variation to fitness

   tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the
   behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously
   monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the
   same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity. We focused
   on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies:
   shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in
   the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the
   expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did
   not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental
   factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed
   appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some
   behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately
   assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly
   context-specific. Our results highlight the importance of validating the

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In marine habitats, increasing ocean temperatures due to global climate
   change may distinctly reduce nutrient and consequently food availability
   for seabirds. Food availability is a known driver of body mass and
   reproductive investment in birds, but these traits may also depend on
   individual effects. Penguins show extreme intra-annual body mass
   variation and rely on accumulated body reserves for successful breeding.
   However, no study so far has tested individual consistency and
   phenotypic responses in body mass and reproductive investment in this
   taxon. Using a unique dataset on individually marked female and male
   southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) across six
   years, we investigated 1) the individual consistency in body mass
   (measured at egg laying), body condition and reproductive investment
   across years, subsequently 2) identified the best-explanatory
   temperature-related environmental variables for female and male body
   mass, and 3) tested the effect of female and male body mass on
   reproductive investment. Body mass, body condition and reproductive
   investment were all highly repeatable. As body condition should control
   for the structural size of the birds, the similarly high repeatability
   estimates for body mass and body condition suggested that the consistent
   between-individual body mass differences were independent of structural
   size. This supported the use of body mass for the subsequent analyses.
   Body mass was higher under colder environmental conditions (positive
   Southern Annular Mode), but the overall phenotypic response appeared
   limited. Reproductive investment increased with female but not male body
   mass. While environmental effects on body mass in our study period were
   rather small, one can expect that ongoing global climate change will
   lead to a deterioration of food availability and we might therefore in
   the long-term expect a phenotypical decline in body mass and
   reproductive investment.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behavioral variation is ubiquitous across taxa and important
   to understand if we wish to fully use behavioral data to understand the
   ecology and evolution of organisms. Only recently have studies of
   individual variation in dispersal behavior become a focus of research. A
   better understanding of individual variation in dispersal behavior is
   likely to improve our understanding of population dynamics. In
   particular, the dynamics of critically small populations (endangered
   species) and large populations (pest species) may be driven by unique
   dispersal variants. Here we documented individual variation in the
   ballooning dispersal behavior of Western black widow spiderlings
   Latrodectus hesperus, an urban pest species found in superabundant
   infestations throughout cities of the desert Southwest USA. We found a
   great deal of family-level variation in ballooning dispersal, and this
   variation was highly consistent (repeatable) across time. Maternal egg
   investment was a poor predictor of this ballooning dispersal. Instead,
   we show that spiderlings reared in isolation are significantly slower to
   disperse than spiderlings raised in a more natural setting surrounded by
   full siblings. Thus, our study examines a widespread but poorly
   understood dispersal behavior (ballooning), and suggests urban pest
   population dynamics are likely driven by the interaction of variation in

Abstract = {{Prevalence findings for the elderly are artificially low, most likely

   Aims(1) To describe the rationale for the development of an age-adapted
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI65+) for use in a
   European project (MentDis\_ICF65+). (2) To examine its test-retest
   reliability.
   MethodsBased on substantive pilot work the CIDI standard questions were
   shortened, broken down into shorter subsets and combined with
   sensitization questions and dimensional measures. Test-retest was
   determined in N=68 subjects aged 60-79 years via two independent
   examinations by clinical interviewers using kappa (sensitivity,
   specificity) for categorical and intraclass correlation (ICC)
   coefficients for dimensional measures.
   ResultsTest-retest reliability was good for any mental disorder (=0.63),
   major depression (=0.55), anxiety (=0.62, range=0.30-0.78), substance
   (=0.77, range=0.71-0.82), obsessive-compulsive disorder (=1.00) and most
   core symptoms/syndromes ( range=0.48-1.00). Agreement for some disorders
   (i.e. somatoform/pain) attenuated, partly due to time lapse effects. ICC
   for age of onset, recency, quantity, frequency and duration questions
   ranged between =0.60-0.90. Dimensional agreement measures were not
   consistently higher.
   ConclusionThe age-adapted CIDI65+ is reliable for assessing most mental
   disorders, distress, impairment and time-related information in the

Abstract = {{The dot-probe task has been widely used in research to produce an index

   properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no
   previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or
   systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis
   decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we used dot-probe
   data from 3 studies in which attention bias toward threat-related faces
   was assessed at multiple (>= 5) time-points. Two of the studies were
   similar (adults with social anxiety disorder, similar design features)
   whereas 1 was more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct
   task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias
   score formula, outlier handling method) on reliability and searched for
   convergent findings across the 3 studies. We found that, when
   concurrently considering the 3 studies, the most reliable RT index of
   bias used data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to
   incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging
   across more than 1 assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias
   indices was moderate to low, within-session variability in bias
   (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was
   more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of
   attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed
   reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV). On the basis of

Abstract = {{The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 2003) is a professional
   rating scale that enjoys widespread use in forensic and correctional
   settings, primarily as a tool to inform risk assessments in a variety of
   types of cases (e.g., parole determinations, sexually violent predator
   {[}SVP] civil commitment). Although widely described as ``reliable and
   valid{''} in research reports, several recent field studies have
   suggested that PCL-R scores provided by examiners in forensic cases are
   significantly less reliable than the interrater reliability values
   reported in research studies. Most of these field studies, however, have
   had small samples and only examined SVP civil commitment cases. This
   study builds on existing research by examining the reliability of PCL-R
   scores provided by forensic examiners in a much more extensive sample of
   Canadian criminal cases. Using the LexisNexis database, we identified
   102 cases in which at least 2 scores were reported (of 257 total PCL-R
   scores). The single-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICCA1) was
   .59, indicating that a large percentage of the variance in individual
   scores was attributable to some form of error. ICC values were somewhat
   higher for sexual offending cases (. 66) than they were for nonsexual
   offending cases (.46), indicating that poor interrater reliability was
   not restricted specifically to the assessment of sexual offenders. These
   and earlier findings concerning field reliability in legal cases suggest
   that the standard error of measurement for PCL-R scores that are
   provided to the courts is likely to be much larger than the value of
   2.90 reported in the instrument's manual.}},

Abstract = {{New Findings
   What is the topic of this review? In personalized medicine', various
   plots and analyses are purported to quantify individual differences in
   intervention response, identify responders/non-responders and explore
   response moderators or mediators.
   What advances does it highlight? We highlight the impact of
   within-subject random variation, which is inevitable even with
   gold-standard' measurement tools/protocols and sometimes so substantial
   that it explains all apparent individual response differences. True
   individual response differences are quantified only by comparing the SDs
   of changes between intervention and comparator arms. When these SDs are
   similar, true individual response differences are clinically unimportant
   and further analysis unwarranted.
   Within the hot topic' of personalized medicine, we scrutinize common
   approaches for presenting and quantifying individual differences in the
   physiological response to an intervention. First, we explain how popular
   plots used to present individual differences in response are
   contaminated by random within-subject variation and the regression to
   the mean artefact. Using a simulated data set of blood pressure
   measurements, we show that large individual differences in physiological
   response can be suggested by some plots and analyses, even when the true
   magnitude of response is exactly the same in all individuals. Second, we
   present the appropriate designs and analysis approaches for quantifying
   the true interindividual variation in physiological response. It is
   imperative to include a comparator arm/condition (or derive information
   from a prior relevant repeatability study) to quantify true
   interindividual differences in response. The most important statistic is
   the SD of changes in the intervention arm, which should be compared with
   the same SD in the comparator arm or from a prior repeatability study in
   the same population conducted over the same duration as the particular
   intervention. Only if the difference between these SDs is clinically
   relevant is it logical to go on to explore any moderators or mediators
   of the intervention effect that might explain the individual response.
   To date, very few researchers have compared these SDs before making
   claims about individual differences in physiological response and their
   importance to personalized medicine.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a growth of interest in the consistent
   differences in individual behaviour over time and contexts constituting
   the so-called ``individual coping styles{''}. An understanding of this
   inter-individual variation is essential to improve our knowledge of the
   adaptive value of behaviour. Coping styles may have implications in
   diverse fields, so the development of appropriate screening methods for
   each species appears to be the most effective way to extend our
   knowledge and to incorporate behavioural responses into selection-based
   breeding programmes, to improve the domestication and welfare of farmed
   fish. We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least
   twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation,
   aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and
   group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping
   style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The
   results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and
   between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and
   species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact.
   By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and
   hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and
   long-term). These tests therefore appeared to be the most relevant for
   the characterisation of coping style in European seabass. Furthermore,
   the results of these tests were also predictive of cortisol stress
   response. These tests are simple to perform and can be used to screen
   large numbers of fish, the first step in selection programmes including
   behavioural profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{While the literature on consistent individual differences in correlated
   suites of physiological and behavioural traits is steadily growing for
   vertebrates, invertebrates have received less attention. The few studies
   that do exist have measured temporary physiological states (or
   responses), rather than consistent individual physiological traits.
   Here, I explore the consistency of individual differences in physiology
   and behaviour of n=53 shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) by repeatedly
   measuring haemolymph density (HD) and the crabs' responses to a novel
   environment. In crustaceans, HD is directly proportional to protein
   concentrations, and thus indicative of physiological condition. HD was
   highly repeatable, and crabs showed consistent individual differences in
   their behavioural responses to a novel environment, thus indicating
   individual consistency in both physiology and behaviour. Furthermore, HD
   was significantly correlated with the crabs' risk propensity, i. e.
   individuals with higher HD spent more time near shelter. Overall, this
   provides the first evidence for consistency in an endogenous
   physiological trait in an invertebrate. The link between consistent
   physiology and behaviour, i. e. coping styles, analogous to those found
   in vertebrates, suggests metabolic and/or immunological correlates of
   personality which offer great potential for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in both public information use, and

   Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals
   respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first
   step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked
   whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine
   sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were
   scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of
   activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple
   times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were
   required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the
   foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r =
   0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components
   describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be
   related to either of two measures of public information use. While the
   personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public
   information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect
   opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious
   avenue for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Although personality has been well studied in a wide range of species,
   relatively few studies have assessed if behavior in standardized captive
   tests is predictive of behavior in the wild. We captured wild zebra
   finches around 2 breeding colonies and assayed their exploratory
   behavior with a novel environment test. The birds' foraging behavior in
   the wild was also measured with the use of a passive integrated
   transponder tag system to monitor their use of feeders that were
   periodically moved around the colonies to assess exploratory behavior
   and sociality. During the same period, individuals' reproductive success
   was monitored at the nest-boxes being used in this area. We found that
   our measures of sociality, wild, and captive exploration were
   repeatable, but contrary to our predictions, exploration in the novel
   environment test was not significantly correlated with exploration of
   feeders in the wild. We failed to find a predicted negative relationship
   between exploration and sociality, instead finding a significant
   positive correlation between exploration in the novel environment and
   sociality. Finally, we found little evidence that any of our measured
   personality traits influenced reproductive success at the colony, either
   individually or when the interactions between the personalities of both
   members of the pair were taken into account. The only exception was that
   highly exploratory males (assayed with wild feeder behavior) were more
   likely to make breeding attempts than less exploratory males. Our
   results suggest that researchers should use caution when using tests

   an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality

Abstract = {{The study of adaptive individual behavior ({''}animal personality{''})
   focuses on whether individuals differ consistently in (suites of

   species where behavioral and life-history information can readily be
   collected in the wild, such as ungulates and passerine birds. Here, we
   report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors
   that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the
   wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related
   survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase
   where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As
   proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow,
   flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all
   behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome
   structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily
   survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily
   observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat
   repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed.
   Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of
   repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays
   were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which
   could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected
   behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish
   individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence
   for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance. Our
   findings, therefore, forcefully demonstrate that personality variation

   (aggressiveness and exploration), changed across time and according to
   sex (i.e. the relationship between the raw behaviours that were measured
   in the boldness assay was different for males and females); (2) that
   three of the five behavioural traits exhibited moderate-to-high adjusted
   repeatability while two were not repeatable; (3) covariances between
   behavioural traits were weak to non-existent and did not support the
   presence of any behavioural syndromes. These results indicate that
   structural consistency of traits or the behavioural definition' of an
   aggregate score is potentially variable over time. This may limit
   inference on any subsequent estimates of repeatability of behavioural
   traits, as well as estimates of potential syndromes. Repeatability of
   behavioural traits may reflect underlying ecological importance, or
   measurement processes, and lack of behavioural syndromes may reflect
   lack of selection pressure for trait covariance. Studies examining
   multiple behavioural traits under a measurement as well as an ecological
   framework are crucial to make meaningful inferences regarding the
   ecological and evolutionary significance of behavioural traits.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThere is a need for a measure to evaluate change in treatment
   for offenders with a personality disorder, and the Progress Rating Scale
   (PRS) was developed to meet this need taking account of
   multiprofessional input.
   MethodThe PRS comprises six process and five non-process items developed
   via thematic analysis of routine CPA patient treatment reports at a
   forensic Personality Disorder Service. Rating for items was fully
   standardized and operationalized with revisions aiming to maximize
   inter-rater agreement reflecting good face and content validity.
   Psychometric properties were examined using PRS ratings for 147 patients
   at three different time points in conjunction with relevant
   psychometrics.
   ResultsFollowing refinement, the instrument demonstrated good content
   validity. Intra-class correlations suggested moderate to substantial
   inter-rater agreement (intraclass correlations: 0.63-0.92). Item
   analyses indicated good internal consistency for process items
   (Cronbach's alpha: 0.82-0.88). Correlations with relevant psychometrics
   revealed meaningful relationships between PRS scores, defence styles and
   social problem solving. PRS score trajectories were in line with
   previously known treatment outcomes supporting predictive validity.
   ConclusionThe PRS shows promise as process measure in clinical settings
   but requires further testing on other samples to confirm initial
   findings and demonstrate its utility. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Speedeaccuracy trade-offs are well studied in human decision making, but
   we are only beginning to understand how such trade-offs affect other
   animals. Similarly, it is poorly understood how consistent individual
   differences in decision making are influenced by their social context.
   Here we investigated whether zebrafish, Danio rerio, show individual
   consistency ('personality') in speedeaccuracy trade-offs based on a
   colour discrimination task, and how pairs of fish with distinct
   personalities make consensus choices. The results showed that zebrafish
   exhibit between-individual speedeaccuracy trade-offs: some fish made
   `careful', slow but accurate decisions, while others made swift but less
   accurate choices. We also found that these decision-making strategies
   were constant over time: fish retained the same strategy for 3 days.
   When testing pairs of careful and fast-and-inaccurate individuals, the
   combined choice strategy was intermediate in speed, but statistically
   indistinguishable from the careful individual, whereas accuracy of the
   dyad decision was moderately higher than that of each individual when
   tested singly, although this was again not significantly different from
   the more careful individual. For the first time, our study thus
   demonstrates that two individuals influence one another's speedeaccuracy
   tradeoff in decision making. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits' are behavioural differences between individuals that
   are stable within individuals. Different combinations of personality
   traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain
   unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in
   physiology. For example, fast' (bold, active, fast exploring)
   individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than slow'
   animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative
   stress. Thus, the extended pace of life theory' predicts that fast'
   individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than slow' ones.
   Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in slow'
   individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent
   oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and
   oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia
   (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel
   environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in
   activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but
   were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an
   index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also
   uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood
   sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage
   vs. after 15min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect
   ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and
   exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low
   neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs
   was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency
   also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but
   body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the
   exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body
   condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it
   was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved
   important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many
   processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and
   stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and
   thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex.}},

Abstract = {{Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) is a comprehensive personality
   inventory that is widely used in behavioral genetics. The original
   theory suggested that temperament traits were under genetic influences,
   whereas character traits were gradually built by an interaction between
   temperaments and environment until early adulthood. This study attempted
   to evaluate TCI by examining the genetic and environmental contributions
   to personality with particular attention to spousal effects. From 687
   families, a total of 3459 Korean adult individuals completed the survey.
   Among them, there were 542 Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 122 Dizygotic
   twin pairs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and heritability
   were calculated to examine the genetic and shared environmental
   contributions to personality. Moderate genetic contributions (0.17-0.43)
   were found for all TCI traits along with the evidence of shared
   environment (0.11-031) for harm avoidance (HA) and all characters. The
   ICCs of TCI in MZ pairs ranged 0.36-0.46. Spouses' had little
   resemblance for temperament, whereas for character dimensions, spouses
   (0.27-0.38) were more similar than first degree relatives (0.10-0.29).
   Resemblance between spouses increased with duration of marriage for most
   characters and HA. When the growing similarities between spouses were
   compared with their MZ cotwins' for subgroup of 81 trios,
   self-directedness (SD) of character showed even more similarities toward
   their spouses than cotwins as partnership duration increased (r = 0.32).
   Our findings with regard to change in SD into late adulthood support the
   psychobiological theory of temperament and character, which suggests
   that both personality domains have distinct developmental trajectories
   despite equally large genetic influences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   females are more likely to shoal than shy females, but only when
   presented with heterospecific individuals. Additionally, aggression does
   not correlate with boldness or shoaling propensity for either sex. A

Abstract = {{According to the ``pace-of-life syndrome{''} concept, slow-fast
   life-history strategies favored under different ecological conditions
   should lead to co-adaptations between metabolic rate and personality
   traits such as activity, exploration, and boldness. Although the
   relationships between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and personality
   traits have been recently tested several times, we still do not know
   whether personality is related to the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of
   free-living individuals in their natural habitat. The objectives of this
   study were to assess the links between RMR, DEE, and two personality
   traits (exploration in an open-field and docility during handling) in
   wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Using a multivariate mixed
   model, we found that exploration and docility were significantly
   correlated at the among-individual level, confirming the presence of a
   behavioral syndrome within our population. We also found that
   exploration, but not docility, was negatively correlated with DEE.
   Hence, fast explorers show lower DEE levels than slow explorers,
   independently of RMR and docility. This result adds to an increasingly
   large (and complex) literature reporting the impacts of personality
   traits on the biology, ecology, and physiology of animals in their

Abstract = {{Aggression is a psychological construct that is commonly used to
   classify zebrafish behavior. Aggression is a complex trait that can be
   difficult to accurately measure. The literature on fish behavior
   describes many different methodologies to examine aggression, which, we
   believe, have not been compared in a formal manner. In this study we
   observed 19 individual zebrafish (Danio rerio) and quantified bites,
   lateral displays, charges, darts, and time near the stimulus in six
   common assays used to measure aggression. The methodologies included an
   inclined mirror assay, two flat mirror assays with different acclimation
   periods, a live conspecific assay, a clay model stimulus assay, and a
   video recording assay. Our results indicate high repeatability in most
   aggressive behaviors over time, which confirms the value of each assay
   to measure personality. However, our results also indicate significant
   differences between the assays. Specifically, assays using a flat mirror
   or live conspecific as a stimulus for aggression elicited more attempted
   bites than an inclined mirror, a clay model stimulus, or a video
   recording stimulus. Furthermore, the inclined mirror stimulus provoked
   more darts than any other assay. The results suggest the need for
   researchers to consider specific research goals when selecting the

Abstract = {{Although personality has been documented in numerous animals and
   characters, research into personality-dependent spatial ecology has
   focused on dispersal. Indeed, few authors have investigated the role of
   other important spatial traits such as home range, movement distance,
   vertical activity, and site fidelity, and it is not clear whether these
   behaviors are correlated with dispersal. In this study, we investigated
   individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical
   activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota
   lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian
   mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met
   the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior:
   repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of
   pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then
   tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors,
   indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable,
   cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range,
   movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast,
   behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across
   sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our
   data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from
   dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from
   ``resident{''} individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity,
   and minimal movement to ``mobile{''} individuals with large home ranges,
   high movement rates, and little site fidelity. Our findings suggest
   animal personality can play a key role in shaping the space use of
   individuals, and this diversity in spatial behaviors may be too complex
   to be captured by often used simple linear measures of dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Clinically relevant identity disturbance, rather than more normative
   identity confusion, is a construct that has received limited empirical
   attention. This relative lack of empirical research is surprising, given
   that identity disturbance is a criterion for BPD, among the proposed
   features of all DSM-5 personality disorders, and may also be relevant
   for many other psychiatric diagnoses. The nomenclature used to describe
   identity-related constructs is currently unstandardized and many
   theorists have described overlapping concepts. Thus, there is a need to
   operationalize identity problems and improve measurement of this
   important construct. In this article we report the results of two
   studies that establish the psychometric properties and factor structure
   of the Self-Concept and Identity Measure (SCIM). The SCIM is a brief,
   self-report scale designed to assess dimensions of identity (healthy and
   disturbed) among adults. Participants were recruited through a
   psychology department subject pool (Study 1; n = 536) and also through
   Amazon's Mechanical Turk Website (Study 2; n = 470). An exploratory
   factor analysis of Study 1 data revealed a 3-factor structure. A
   confirmatory factor analysis validated the 3-factor structure in the
   community sample recruited for Study 2. Results indicate that the SCIM
   is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality
   Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology. Scores on
   the SCIM yielded high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89),
   test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.93, r = 0.88; intraclass correlation
   coefficient = 0.88), and adequate construct validity. The SCIM appears
   to produce valid and reliable test scores, with promising applications

Abstract = {{The United States Marine Corps (USMC) uses Labrador retrievers as
   improvised explosive device detection dogs (IDDs). Of critical
   importance is the selection of dogs that are emotionally suited for this
   highly specialized application. The goal of our study was to develop an
   emotional reactivity test (ERT) as a screening tool for the selection of
   IDDs. The ERT included a series of subtasks that expose each dog
   sequentially to visual, auditory, and experiential stimuli with an
   associated grading scale used by trained observers to rate individual
   dog responses. In this study, 16 Labrador retrievers that met initial
   selection criteria as candidate IDDs were assessed using the ERT,
   measurement of plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations (pre-and
   post-ERT), and an independent open-field test of anxiety in response to
   sound stimuli. Based on the sum of its responses, each dog was assigned
   an aggregate ERT score. Aggregate ERT scores from independent trained
   observers were highly concordant {[} Shrout-Fleiss's intraclass
   correlation (2,1) = 0.96] suggesting excellent inter-rater reliability.
   The aggregate ERT scores were also negatively correlated with the dogs'
   scores on the open-field anxiety test (Spearman rank correlation, n =
   16, r = -0.57, P = 0.0214). In addition, there were significant
   increases in salivary (Wilcoxon signed rank, n = 16, S = 38.5, P 0.0458)
   and plasma (Wilcoxon signed rank, n = 16, S = 68, P < 0.0001) cortisol
   levels after the ERT, compared with baseline, suggesting that exposure
   to the ERT test elements produced a physiological stress response. We
   conclude that the ERT is a useful pre-training screening test that can
   be used to identify dogs with a low threshold of emotional reactivity
   for rejection, and dogs with a high threshold of emotional reactivity
   for entry into the IDD training program. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We review the evidence for a link between consistent among-individual
   variation in behaviour (animal personality) and the ability to win
   contests over limited resources. Explorative and bold behaviours often
   covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence
   that the structure of these `behavioural syndromes' can change across
   situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject
   to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic
   responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common
   proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic
   rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general
   personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of
   fighting and of personality, we suggest that longitudinal studies of
   contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, would
   be a useful context for the study of animal personalities.}},
