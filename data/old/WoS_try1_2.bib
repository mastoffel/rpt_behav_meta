Abstract = {{During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the
   energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource
   depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between
   individuals of different personality types. We tested whether
   individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus,
   forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking
   behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel
   object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment,
   we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites.
   During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to
   exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel
   object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these
   individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively
   indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start
   feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to
   nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk
   taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk.
   Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing
   field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between
   individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness
   measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a
   foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this
   personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual
   differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of
   variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using
   optimality approaches. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the stability and repeatability of measures of
   mechanical (nociceptive) thresholds in piglets and to examine
   potentially confounding factors when using a hand held algometer. Study
   design Descriptive, prospective cohort. Animals Forty-four piglets from
   four litters, weighing 4.6 +/- 1.0 kg (mean +/- SD) at 2 weeks of age.
   Methods Mechanical thresholds were measured twice on each of 2 days
   during the first and second week of life. Data were analyzed using a
   repeated measures design to test the effects of behavior prior to
   testing, sex, week, day within week, and repetition within day. The
   effect of body weight and the interaction between piglet weight and
   behaviour were also tested. Piglet was entered into the model as a
   random effect as an additional test of repeatability. The effect of
   repeated testing was used to test the stability of measures. Pearson
   correlations between repeated measures were used to test the
   repeatability of measures. Variance component analysis was used to
   describe the variability in the data. Results Variance component
   analysis indicated that piglet explained only 17\% of the variance in
   the data. All variables in the model (behaviour prior to testing, sex,
   week, day within week, repetition within day, body weight, the
   interaction between body weight and behaviour, piglet identity) except
   sex had a significant effect (p < 0.04 for all). Correlations between
   repeated measures increased from the first to the second week.
   Conclusions and Clinical relevance Repeatability was acceptable only
   during the second week of testing and measures changed with repeated
   testing and increased with increasing piglet weight, indicating that
   time (age) and animal body weight should be taken into account when
   measuring mechanical (nociceptive) thresholds in piglets. Mechanical
   (nociceptive) thresholds can be used both for testing the efficacy of
   anaesthetics and analgesics, and for assessing hyperalgesia in chronic
   pain states in research and clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the
   life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to
   travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in
   dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g.
   specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar
   reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive
   abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl
   is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many
   physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress
   response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is
   also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site
   to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one
   breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set.
   Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during
   natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering
   experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents
   had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by
   parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and
   breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating
   that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled
   in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might
   be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to
   explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration
   and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but
   the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly
   understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones
   (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards
   predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future
   fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress
   physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated
   flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria
   mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone
   concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body
   condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether
   stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either
   independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether
   incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females,
   would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for
   individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and
   females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations
   generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by
   interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High
   stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger
   females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females.
   Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less
   strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy
   females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter
   incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness,
   helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival.
   However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood
   in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{There is much interest in studying animal personalities but considerable
   debate as to how to define and evaluate them. We assessed the utility of
   one proposed framework while studying personality in terrestrial hermit
   crabs (Coenobita clypeatus). We recorded the latency of individuals to
   emerge from their shells over multiple trials in four unique
   manipulations. We used the specific testing situations within these
   manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral
   consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same
   situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations
   between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs
   had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between
   behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these
   correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component
   analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors
   and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured
   behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general
   personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention
   must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods,
   and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

Abstract = {{1. One of the main drivers of the genesis and maintenance of
   biodiversity is mobility, i.e. the net result of the interaction between
   physiological performances (movement capacity) and behavioural decisions
   (movement decisions). Although several previous studies have found
   personality traits related to mobility, it is not yet clear whether
   mobility involves a real syndrome, i.e. whether individuals showing good
   movement capacity are also more likely to decide to move, and whether
   these inter-individual differences are consistent across time. 2. The
   aim of the present study was therefore to disentangle the mechanisms
   underlying the maintenance of inter-individual variation in mobility by
   measuring three traits related to mobility under experimental conditions
   in a butterfly species, and to test the existence of correlations
   between these traits. These measures implied movement capacity and
   movement decision. 3. It was shown that mobility-related traits were (i)
   consistent across time, (ii) inter-correlated, and (iii) dependent upon
   sex and morphology. 4. These results therefore suggest the existence of
   a mobility syndrome in a butterfly. Such findings highlight the
   necessity to accurately integrate inter-individual variation
   (behavioural syndrome) in our comprehension of the evolution of movement

   traits exploratory tendencies and struggling rate using captive female
   zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental
   sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up
   to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that,
   overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly
   repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were

   Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both

Abstract = {{In evolutionary and behavioural ecology, increasing attention is being
   paid to the fact that functionally distinct behaviours are often not
   independent from each other. Such phenomenon is labelled as behavioural
   syndrome and is usually demonstrated by phenotypic correlations between
   behaviours like activity, exploration, aggression and risk-taking across
   individuals in a population. However, published studies disagree on the
   strength, and even on the existence of such relationships. To make
   general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed
   the literature using modern meta-analytic approaches. Based on a large
   dataset, we investigated the overall relationship between behaviours
   that are expected to form a syndrome and tested which factors can
   mediate heterogeneities in study outcomes. The average strength of the
   phenotypic correlation between behaviours was weak; we found no effect
   of the phylogeny of species but did observe significant publication
   bias. However, even accounting for this bias, the mean effect size was
   positive and statistically different from zero (r = 0.198). Effect sizes
   showed considerable heterogeneity within species, implying a role for
   population-specific adaptation to environmental factors and/or
   between-study differences in research design. There was a significant
   positive association between absolute effect size and repeatability of
   behaviours, suggesting that within-individual variation of behavioural
   traits can set up an upper limit for the strength of the detected
   phenotypic correlations. Moreover, spatial overlap between the contexts
   in which different behaviours were assayed increased the magnitude of
   the association. The small effect size for the focal relationship
   implies that a huge sample size would be required to demonstrate a
   correlation between behaviours with sufficient statistical power, which
   is fulfilled only in very few studies. This suggests that behavioural
   syndromes often remain undetected and unpublished. Collectively, our
   meta-analysis revealed a number of points that might be worth to
   consider in the future study of behavioural syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual behavioral differences across ecological contexts
   are a recognized feature of animal populations. These differences can be
   expressed in two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The
   former is characterized by consistent responses in one context (i.e.
   repeatability), whereas the latter by consistency that spans contexts
   (i.e. behavioral syndromes). The proximate causes of behavioral
   consistency remain unclear, yet there is evidence that physiology may
   couple the expression of some behavioral traits in unrelated contexts.
   We therefore explored the correlation between bold behavior of female
   sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and the condition of the
   hepatopancreas, an organ vital to crustacean metabolism and
   reproduction. We did this by taking replicate measurements of two
   risk-taking behaviors per individual in the contexts of predator
   avoidance and environment exploration, and examining correlations within
   and between these observations. We then determined the relationship of
   behavior with hepatopancreas mass and lipid content. Individual crabs
   responded consistently within each context. However, across-context
   correlations were absent, indicating that boldness is isolated, at least
   in the selected scenarios. Additionally, anti-predator and exploratory
   behaviors were significantly influenced by size but not linked to
   hepatopancreas physiology. Our results show that context-specific trait

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic comparative studies rely on species-specific data that
   often contain missing values and/or differ in sample size among species.
   These phenomena may violate statistical assumptions about the non-random
   variance component in sampling effort. A major reason why this
   assumption is often not fulfilled is because the probability of being
   sampled (i.e., being captured or observed) may depend on
   species-specific characteristics. Here, we test this assumption by using
   information on within-species sample sizes and missing data from five
   independent comparative datasets of European birds. First, we show that
   the two estimates of data availability (missing values and
   within-species sample size) are positively correlated and are associated
   with research effort in general (the number of papers published).
   Second, we demonstrate biologically meaningful relationships between
   data availability and phenotypic traits. For example, population size,
   risk-taking, and habitat specialization independently predicted
   within-species sample size. The key determinants of missing data were
   population size and distribution range. However, data availability was
   not structured by phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate
   that the accuracy of sampling is repeatable and distributed non-randomly
   among species, as several species-specific attributes determined the
   probability of observation. Therefore, data availability seems to be a

Abstract = {{The detrimental effects of steroid-mimics are well known but
   investigations on non-steroid pharmaceuticals are less common. In
   addition, most behavioral studies do not examine the effects at multiple
   time points. This study examined the effects of fluoxetine, a selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on behavior when male Siamese fighting
   fish encounter female and male dummy conspecifics simultaneously. Thus,
   how chemical exposure impacts behavioral consistency and whether
   individuals differ in their sensitivity to exposure was assessed.
   Overall aggression was reduced after fluoxetine administration while
   courtship was unaffected. Fluoxetine affected behavioral consistency
   towards both the male and female, with individuals behaving less
   consistently to the male and more consistently to the female. In
   addition, males appeared to differ in their sensitivity to fluoxetine
   exposure as not all males reduced their aggression after administration.
   This has important implications for studying the effects of unintended
   pharmaceutical exposure. Exposure may have evolutionary implications as
   it may influence both territorial defense and mating success. In sum,
   these findings demonstrate that pharmaceutical exposure may alter more
   than just overall level of behavior and stress the importance of
   examining the effects of exposure on an individual level. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Animal personality, repeatable behaviour through time and across
   contexts, is ecologically and evolutionarily important as it can account
   for the exhibition of sub-optimal behaviours. Interspecific comparisons
   have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of
   animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part,
   to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and
   similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine
   species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the
   usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of
   between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity.
   We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing

   analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation
   procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and
   identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found
   that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some
   species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that
   ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to

Abstract = {{Harvesting wild populations may contrast or reinforce natural agents of
   selection and potentially cause evolutionary changes in life-history
   traits such as growth and maturation. Harvest selection may also act on
   behavioral traits, although this field of research has so far received
   less attention. We used acoustic tags and a network of receivers to
   monitor the behavior and fate of individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua,
   N = 60) in their natural habitat on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Fish
   with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow-and
   deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery
   (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper
   water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish
   size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration. Natural
   selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a
   large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant
   repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual
   characteristics tended to persist and therefore may be termed
   personality traits. We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries
   management should consider fish behavior. This would be of particular
   relevance for spatial management actions such as marine reserve design.}},

Abstract = {{Current scores for equine personality traits assessed during performance
   tests are characterised by high means and inadequate variation,
   hampering genetic selection for these traits. A number of temperament
   and related behaviour tests have been developed in order to make
   assessment of equine personality more objective. However, rarely these
   tests have been validated for their use as a selection tool. Thus, as a
   first step the aim of the present study was to integrate a temperament
   tests into horse performance tests, in order to assess variability and
   repeatability of horses' reactivity under the rider and the reliability
   of the judges' assessment thereof. The temperament test was comprised of
   three novel stimuli, including a visual stimulus (BALL), a visual and
   tactile stimulus (GATE), and a visual and auditory stimulus (CANS). A
   total of 224 mares and stallions were subjected to the test during their
   participation in station performance tests for riding horses, and 133 of
   these horses were subjected to the test a second time either 2-3 weeks
   or 18 weeks after the first test. Horses were ridden in the test by
   professional riders, and their reactions to the stimuli were evaluated
   each by two judges and the rider using scores on a scale from 1 (task
   not concluded) to 10 (completely calm but attentive horse). Mean scores
   (+/- SD) ranged between 6.6 +/- 2.4 (GATE) and 7.8 +/- 2.1 (BALL),
   demonstrating lower means and considerably higher standard deviations
   than the same horses' scores from present evaluation of the trait
   labelled temperament (8.1 +/- 0.9) or related personality traits (e.g.
   character: 8.3 +/- 0.8). Using variance components from mixed model
   analysis, inter-observer agreement between the two judges was for the
   individual stimuli very high (0.95 (BALL), 0.96 (GATE), 0.89 (CANS)),
   and there was likewise high agreement between the judges' and the riders
   combined scores (0.93). Repeatabilities of horses' scores were 0.72
   (BALL), 0.75 (GATE), and 0.69 (CANS). Correlations to traits from the
   present evaluation of personality were low or non-existent, indicating
   that these traits are not a reflection of anxiety or fear reactivity as
   assessed by novel object tests. Horses' improvement in judges' combined
   scores from first to second test was not (P > 0.1) influenced by
   differences in time between tests, but differed between breed-types and
   individual riders. Also, not surprisingly, the higher horses' scores in
   the first test were, the lower their improvement in the second test was
   (-0.45 +/- 0.06 per additional score in the first test). Temperament
   tests using novel stimuli presented to horses under a rider may be a
   practical and valid tool for improving the current assessment of equine
   personality traits during performance tests. Considering a combination
   of absolute scores and horses' improvement in scores of repeated tests,
   rather than measuring only absolute scores yields relevant information
   about horses' personality, and at the same time it may prevent owners
   from deliberately training their horses for low reactions to the
   test-stimuli. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, using a personality approach for studies of animal
   behaviour has increased our ability to predict an individual's or
   population's behavioural responses to external stimuli. At a population
   level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and
   the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across
   different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a
   predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced
   changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural
   type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether
   exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness.
   We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally
   different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or
   contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural
   antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing
   (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types
   expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e.
   shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However,
   an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in
   either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses
   were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that
   individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased
   predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and
   that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{Remarkable diversity in behaviour and morphology (phenotypes) are often
   observed within a species; this diversity can be understood in terms of
   individuals maximizing their fitness. Based on evidence from studies
   linking different phenotypes to individual behaviours we hypothesize
   that discrete colour polymorphism can reflect personality. We tested for
   such a relationship in a social bird, the Gouldian finch, which shows
   two major head-colour morphs: red and black. Forty birds of differing
   head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found
   that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird
   performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour.
   Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than
   pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and
   touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder);
   (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the
   presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4)
   boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole
   sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed
   birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that
   colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural
   differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{197-204}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Behaviour is generally plastic to some degree and allows an animal to
   react appropriately to changing and novel conditions. Consequently, a
   degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an
   organism's ability to cope with novel (e. g. urban) environments. Yet
   behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals
   exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in
   behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus
   personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs
   in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The
   spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated
   between-and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability
   for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and
   voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high
   individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of
   individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency
   and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness,
   whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not
   heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual
   variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours
   related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may
   be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes
   success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether
   composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and
   survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had
   highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not
   significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in
   high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean
   aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive
   personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would
   be a possible scenario. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The construct of alexithymia as a vulnerability factor for substance use

   follow-up of a 3-month trial of inpatient Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
   (CBT) with or without a Shared Decision Making intervention for 187 SUB

Abstract = {{When an individual is repeatedly observed or tested in the same context,
   it does not always express the same behaviour. Intraindividual
   variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible
   variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although
   individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this
   topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals.
   Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in
   important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior
   experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to
   differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently
   used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the
   assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using `boldness'
   data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish,
   Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour
   systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result
   of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data
   on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in
   behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual
   differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much
   more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by
   discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to
   interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications
   of our findings for methods currently used to study individual
   differences in behaviour in animals. (c) 2012 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Individuals are regularly documented to consistently differ in their

   others are shy. Within the human personality literature, the big five
   personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with
   testosterone suggested to underpin traits such as aggressiveness. In
   non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression

   most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious
   species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential
   hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic
   genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary
   male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach
   allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst
   controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both
   secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual
   level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT
   scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and
   were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic
   control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than
   hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to
   sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with
   bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was
   not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous
   developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with
   either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. (c)

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is often assumed to be the most flexible of traits, yet
   recent studies show a high repeatability of behaviour within individuals
   even across different functional contexts. Such consistent expression of
   behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with
   less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects
   produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal
   timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying
   correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the
   evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which
   pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct
   behaviours. 2. Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind
   aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds,
   Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of
   aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens
   on aggression and mating behaviour. 3. We found that androgen
   concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and
   interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation
   in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects
   of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences
   among individuals in aggression. 4. These findings suggest that
   decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an
   important step in the evolution of personality traits.}},

   significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but
   mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual

   boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses

   these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was

   post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to
   individual life histories and to environmental variation. The
   reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether
   individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive
   options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and
   anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis,
   however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration
   behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits
   (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk.
   Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor
   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Animals attacked by predators often enter a state of tonic immobility
   (TI) in which individuals appear to simulate death. Despite the fact
   that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals,
   quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild
   vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for
   the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we
   tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2
   components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the
   Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer
   montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in
   boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator
   models) or is simply related to variation in general
   activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We
   analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling
   (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to
   analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively
   high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures
   of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast,
   our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate
   can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI
   a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving
   personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition,
   we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to
   analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other
   approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more
   widely used.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of animals, particularly corvids, will sample from a

   comparable. We quantified food sampling behavior (i.e., number of items
   sampled, visit duration, and number of items taken) of individual
   Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) during experimental field trials.
   Sampling behavior of individual jays was moderately repeatable within

   birds' willingness to approach a novel object and take food in front of
   a predator mount. These results suggest that food sampling is a
   measurable component in the suite of traits comprising the Steller's jay
   behavioral syndrome. Model selection techniques indicated that sampling
   behavior was more common in older, neophilic, risk-prone, larger jays,

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the relative importance of genetics and behavioural copying
   is crucial to appraise the evolvability of behavioural consistencies.
   Yet, genetic and non-genetic factors are often deeply intertwined, and

   sources of variation of adult anti-predator behaviour in the Alpine
   swift (Apus melba) by making use of long-term behavioural observations
   on parents and cross-fostered offspring. By applying an `animal model'
   approach to observational data, we show that antipredator behaviour of
   adult Alpine swifts was significantly repeatable over lifetime (r =
   0.273) and heritable (h(2) = 0.146). Regression models also show that
   antipredator behaviours differed between colonies and sexes (females
   were more tame), and varied with the hour and year of capture. By
   applying a parent-offspring regression approach to 59 offspring that
   were exchanged as eggs or hatchlings between pairs of nests, we
   demonstrate that offspring behaved like their biological parents rather
   than like their foster parents when they were adults themselves. Those
   findings provide strong evidence that antipredator behaviour of adult
   Alpine swifts is shaped by genetics and/or pre-hatching maternal effects

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{351-359}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior suggest that individuals
   respond in a predictable and repeatable manner in a specific situation
   while differing from other individuals. Male Siamese fighting fish
   exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies
   when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously.
   However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is
   unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on
   behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with
   paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain
   a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive
   contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies
   after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive
   behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of
   female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an
   increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that
   only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before
   encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the
   dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited
   similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced
   with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while
   winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not
   influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that
   consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be
   resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days.}},

Abstract = {{1. According to a recent hypothesis, personality traits should form
   integrative pace-of-life syndromes with life-history traits. Potential
   life-history traits that explain personality variation are immune
   defence and growth rate.
   2. We studied whether boldness, measured as hiding behaviour, is
   repeatable during ontogeny in the field cricket, Gryllus integer, and if
   it relates to the efficiency of immune function (i. e. the capacity to
   encapsulate a nylon implant), growth rate, developmental time and size
   as an adult.
   3. Hiding behaviour was rank-order repeatable, and in general, juveniles
   were bolder than adults. Individuals that were cautious at early
   juvenile stages had higher encapsulation responses late in life compared
   with bold individuals. Most clearly, fast-growing individuals matured
   early and invested little in immune defence compared with their
   slower-growing conspecifics, i. e. showed patterns of a ` grow fast, die
   young' life-history strategy.
   4. Our results may arise from a trade-off between immunity-dependent
   survival and bold behaviour. Trade-offs between investment in survival
   and behaviour could account for the maintenance of variation in
   personality traits by favouring certain combinations of behavioural and
   life-history strategies (i. e. pace-of-life-syndromes).}},

Volume = {{154}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive
   evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in
   behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For
   instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality
   evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that
   vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher
   exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to
   higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which
   proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on
   foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any
   motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged
   this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or
   combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have
   additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the
   Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\%
   and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to
   feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency
   to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and
   positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and
   individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a
   period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction
   between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect
   of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the
   relevance of our results in relation to the different factors
   influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a
   life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of
   life-history traits and personality.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with
   animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that
   studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may
   not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some
   individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between
   boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the
   Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed
   in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between
   nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness
   consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by
   factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated
   to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity
   (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold
   individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had
   higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation
   model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and
   reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits
   (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals
   for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently
   underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the
   populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either
   develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for
   obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum
   bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. (C) 2012 The

   strategies: the personality trait `exploration behaviour' and a simple
   cognitive trait, `innovative problem-solving performance'. We assayed
   these traits under standardized conditions in captivity and then
   measured competitive ability at feeders with restricted access in the
   wild. Competitive ability was repeatable within individual males across
   days and correlated positively with exploration behaviour, representing
   the first such demonstration of a link between a personality trait and
   both competitive ability and food intake in the wild. Competitive
   ability was also simultaneously negatively correlated with
   problem-solving performance; individuals who were poor competitors were
   good at problem-solving. Rather than being the result of variation in
   `individual quality', our results support the hypothesis that individual

Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,
   potentially removing these differences.}},

Abstract = {{The glucocorticoid (GC) stress response is thought to be an individual
   trait associated with behaviour and life history strategies. Studies
   exploring such relationships typically assume measured hormone values to
   be repeatable within an individual. However, repeatability of GCs has
   proven variable in wild animals and underlying reasons remain unknown.
   We assessed individual repeatability of circulating stress-induced
   cortisol. the primary GC in teleost fish, and glucose concentrations in
   a wild teleost fish held under consistent laboratory conditions. We also
   tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of intra-individual variability
   in stress-induced cortisol concentrations ({''}cortisol variability{''})
   is influenced by body condition. Wild-caught bluegill sunfish (Lepomis
   macrochirus) were subjected to repeated standardized stressors and blood
   sampled (3 times over 6 days) once cortisol concentrations peaked.
   Various indicators of fish condition, both whole body and physiological,
   were also measured. Overall, stress-induced circulating cortisol
   concentrations were repeatable but stress-induced glucose was not.
   Cortisol variability was related to Fulton's condition factor and size
   (eviscerated mass) where smaller fish in poor condition exhibited
   increased cortisol variability. The findings have implications for the
   interpretation of studies that examine correlates of GC concentrations
   as they suggest consistency in stress responsiveness is influenced by
   factors such as size and condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in boldness have been identified in
   many species and can have important effects on fitness. In most animals,
   juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than
   do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and
   environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the
   boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets,
   adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling
   increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness
   (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets.
   Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We
   found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but
   not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we
   predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also
   found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that
   individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when
   they were nymphs, versus when they were adults.}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency,
   linking behavioural variation to individual differences in other
   phenotypic features. Empirical studies are, however, rare. Here, we
   tested for a size and growth-dependent stable behavioural syndrome in
   the juvenile-stages of a solitary apex predator ( pike, Esox lucius),
   shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming
   activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful
   prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact
   with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was
   considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary
   predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat
   avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural
   syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour
   between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation.
   However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in
   conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the
   state-dependent personality hypothesis. The importance of a combination
   of spatial and temporal environmental variation for generating growth
   differences is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown repeatable individual variability in
   temperament traits. We tested the hypotheses that individual Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) vary consistently in their response to
   predators, a temperament trait, and that this individual variation is
   associated with breeding-site selection. Specifically, we tested whether
   measures of behavioral response to human approaches are associated with
   either patch area or patch openness and thus to area sensitivity. We
   made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010,
   measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the
   distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the
   data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling.
   Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was
   controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance
   and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong
   effect of area or openness on either flight-initiation distance or
   distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to
   predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not
   explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches. Because
   flight-initiation distance is often used to identify distances at which
   human behavior disrupts wildlife, we estimate its mean (21.8 m) and the
   distance at which 75\%, 95\%, and 99\% of the Bobolinks flushed (28, 40,
   and 59 m, respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Although increasing attention is given to both the causes and
   consequences of variation in animal personality, the measurement of
   personality in captive or free-ranging individuals remains an issue. In
   particular, one important question concerns whether personality should
   be established from the existence of complex behavioral syndromes (a
   suite of correlated behavioral traits) or could be more easily deduced
   from a single variable. In that context, it has recently been suggested
   that handling stress, measured through breathing rate during handling,
   could be a good descriptor of personality, at least in passerine birds.
   The authors experimentally investigated to what extent handling stress
   was correlated with personality in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata), as assessed from a suite of repeatable behavioral traits,
   including activity, exploratory behavior, neophobia, and reaction to
   startle. Although breathing rate was repeatable across individuals, it
   was not related to any behavioral trait, suggesting that it cannot be
   used to quickly predict personality, at least in zebra finches.
   Breathing rate during handling, in addition, was related to morphology,
   questioning the fact that breathing rate during handling reflects
   personality irrespective of individual state. The authors suggest that
   inference on global personality from a reduced number of traits should
   be performed with caution.}},

Pages = {{601-622}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming clear that individual animals exhibit behaviours that are
   repeatable, consistent and predictable across various contexts and time,
   and that may be correlated to form behavioural syndromes. The influence
   of parasitism on host behaviour, although well-documented, is only now
   being examined in a multi-trait context, and behavioural syndromes
   provide a framework for such investigations. We test the hypothesis that
   parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the
   relationship between infection by four trematode species and the
   correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours
   (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus
   cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a
   significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these
   behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator
   cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were
   significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon
   sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test
   sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue.
   Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression
   was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis,
   Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the
   association depending on the behaviour tested. These findings suggest
   that behavioural syndromes may not only be targets for adaptive host
   manipulation by parasites, but also that, even if through mere

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits may play a role in
   reproductive behaviour and it is likely that different personality types
   have different reproductive success across specific social environments.
   This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types,
   including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive
   tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders
   (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing
   the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of
   personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto
   been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences
   in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a
   small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We
   predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males
   that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of
   behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural
   syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual
   male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm
   competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials.
   Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with
   the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression
   and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard
   a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant
   association between the tendency to guard and morphological and
   physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding
   tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating
   tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the
   product of prevailing environmental and social conditions.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Changes in typical whole-animal dependent variables following drug
   administration represent an integral of the drug's pharmacological
   effect, the individual's autonomic and behavioral responses to the
   resulting disturbance, and many other influences. An archetypical
   example is core temperature (T-c), long used for quantifying initial
   drug sensitivity and tolerance acquisition over repeated drug
   administrations. Our previous work suggested that rats differing in
   initial sensitivity to nitrous oxide (N2O)-induced hypothermia would
   exhibit different patterns of tolerance development across N2O
   administrations. Specifically, we hypothesized that rats with an
   initially insensitive phenotype would subsequently develop regulatory
   overcompensation that would mediate an allostatic hyperthermic state,
   whereas rats with an initially sensitive phenotype would subsequently
   compensate to a homeostatic normothermic state. To preclude confounding
   due to handling and invasive procedures, a valid test of this prediction
   required non-invasive thermal measurements via implanted telemetric
   temperature sensors, combined direct and indirect calorimetry, and
   automated drug delivery to enable repeatable steady-state dosing. We
   screened 237 adult rats for initial sensitivity to 70\% N2O-induced
   hypothermia. Thirty highly sensitive rats that exhibited marked
   hypothermia when screened and 30 highly insensitive rats that initially
   exhibited minimal hypothermia were randomized to three groups (n=10
   each/group) that received: (1) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\% N2O using
   a classical conditioning procedure, (2) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\%
   N2O using a random control procedure for conditioning, or (3) a no-drug
   control group that received custom-made air. Metabolic heat production
   (via indirect calorimetry), body heat loss (via direct calorimetry) and
   T-c (via telemetry) were simultaneously quantified during N2O and
   control gas administrations. Initially insensitive rats rapidly acquired
   (3rd administration) a significant allostatic hyperthermic phenotype
   during N2O administration whereas initially sensitive rats exhibited
   classical tolerance (normothermia) during N2O inhalation in the 4th and
   5th sessions. However, the sensitive rats subsequently acquired the
   hyperthermic phenotype and became indistinguishable from initially
   insensitive rats during the 11th and 12th N2O administrations. The major
   mechanism for hyperthermia was a brisk increase in metabolic heat
   production. However, we obtained no evidence for classical conditioning
   of thermal responses. We conclude that the degree of initial sensitivity
   to N2O-induced hypothermia predicts the temporal pattern of thermal
   adaptation over repeated N2O administrations, but that initially
   insensitive and sensitive animals eventually converge to similar (and
   substantial) magnitudes of within-administration hyperthermia mediated
   by hyper-compensatory heat production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1. Interest in the evolutionary origin and maintenance of individual
   behavioural variation and behavioural plasticity has increased in recent
   years.
   2. Consistent individual behavioural differences imply limited
   behavioural plasticity, but the proximate causes and wider consequences
   of this potential constraint remain poorly understood. To date, few
   attempts have been made to explore whether individual variation in
   behavioural plasticity exists, either within or between populations.
   3. We assayed ` exploration behaviour' among wild-caught individual
   great tits Parus major when exposed to a novel environment room in four
   populations across Europe. We quantified levels of individual variation
   within and between populations in average behaviour, and in behavioural
   plasticity with respect to (i) repeated exposure to the room (test
   sequence), (ii) the time of year in which the assays were conducted and
   (iii) the interval between successive tests, all of which indicate
   habituation to novelty and are therefore of functional significance.
   4. Consistent individual differences ('I') in behaviour were present in
   all populations; repeatability (range: 0.34-0.42) did not vary between
   populations. Exploration behaviour was also plastic, increasing with
   test sequence - but less so when the interval between subsequent tests
   was relatively large - and time of year; populations differed in the
   magnitude of plasticity with respect to time of year and test interval.
   Finally, the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour
   increased significantly from first to repeat tests in all populations.
   Individuals with high initial scores showed greater increases in
   exploration score than individuals with low initial scores; individual
   by environment interaction ('I x E') with respect to test sequence did
   not vary between populations.
   5. Our findings imply that individual variation in both average level of
   behaviour and behavioural plasticity may generally characterize wild
   great tit populations and may largely be shaped by mechanisms acting
   within populations. Experimental approaches are now needed to confirm
   that individual differences in behavioural plasticity (habituation) -
   not other hidden biological factors caused the observed patterns of I x
   E. Establishing the evolutionary causes and consequences of this
   variation in habituation to novelty constitutes an exciting future
   challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Both personality and plasticity can influence fitness, but few studies

   simultaneously for the same behaviour. The individual quality hypothesis
   proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be
   better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a
   high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis
   proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated,

   rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two
   hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness
   (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this
   behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their
   consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows,
   Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as
   a random effect, we found that consistent differences between
   individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness
   and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to
   variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality
   hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a
   higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a
   reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for
   the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor
   plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results
   suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important
   components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of
   each are context dependent. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined interactions between resource availability,
   life-history traits and sexual conflict on species-specific provisioning
   rates, and within-individual variation of parental care. To this end, we
   used 1129 nest observation periods from 118 nests across 4 populations
   to examine how parental nest visitation varied according to sex, food
   availability, and offspring need (brood size and age) in the stitchbird
   (hihi: Notiomystis cincta). Males increased their provisioning
   proportional to brood size regardless of food availability, whereas
   females did not increase provisioning to larger broods unless food
   supplemented. Male provisioning consistently followed the age-dependent
   energy requirements of the nestlings, whereas females showed little or
   no brood age-provisioning relationships. Thus, males were more sensitive
   than females to changes in the energy demands of their offspring;
   however, this was probably because females were already providing food
   at a high rate and could not respond to increased demand unless given
   additional food. Sex and habitat-specific repeatability estimates of
   parental effort suggest that variation in female provisioning behavior
   tends to be driven by differences in the local environment, whereas
   variation in male provisioning is more related to differences in
   individual quality. These sex-specific responses of parental care can be
   largely explained by the relative benefits of provisioning; females
   provisioned at a high rate to offspring they knew to be their own, based
   on available resources. In contrast, when food was abundant, males did
   not increase their provisioning to offspring probably because of the
   opportunity for additional matings via forced extrapair copulations.}},

   C. 2011. Temperament in beef cattle: methods of measurement and their
   relationship to production. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 557-565. Temperament
   is an individual trait influencing an animal's behavioural response to
   handling. This characteristic likely modulates the response of the
   animal to environments and social situations, and is perhaps best viewed
   as a component of its personality. We assessed temperament using three
   objective measuring tools, to determine if correlations exist between
   these and a traditional subjective evaluation. The tools used were
   strain gauges, a ``movement measuring device{''} (MMD), and a chute exit
   timer. Four hundred steers were used. Exit time was correlated with
   values recorded with the MMD and absolute strain forces, and MMD values
   were related to absolute strain forces. When the animals were classified
   as ``calm{''} or ``wild{''} based on their subjective scoring, these two
   groups differed in their mean exit times, MMD values and absolute strain
   forces. The three objective measures yielded statistically correlated
   results between tests and across repetitions, and therefore may quantify
   correlated aspects of a personality trait (i.e., temperament). The
   objective scores were related to the traditional subjective score, but
   they provide the advantage of eliminating observer bias and may offer
   better tools for temperament selection. Significant positive
   relationships of daily gain with subjective score and M M D values
   indicate that traditional subjective scoring techniques can be replaced
   with more repeatable objective measures when temperaments are assessed
   for performance studies.}},

   individual differences in social tendency in five tropical spider
   species (genus Anelosimus). We further determined the extent to which
   social tendency is correlated with other aspects of an individual's
   behaviour that might reflect division of labour within colonies. We
   found that all five species showed repeatable within-species variation

   reduced aggressiveness towards prey and diminished boldness towards an

Abstract = {{Fearful behavioral responses to handling (temperament) are undesirably
   associated with ADG and meat quality in infrequently handled Bos indicus
   cattle. It has never been assessed whether these relationships exist in
   calmer Bos taurus breeds in systems where handling is more frequent.
   Such systems predominate in some countries where beef production is a
   major agricultural activity. During fattening, 144 crossbred cattle from
   Limousin and Aberdeen Angus sires were assessed for temperament using 4
   approaches: response to movement along a race (race score; 4 occasions),
   restraint in a crush (crush score; 4 occasions), flight speed from the
   crush (flight speed; 4 occasions), and isolation in a pen with a human
   (isolation score; 1 occasion in yr 1, 2 occasions in yr 2). Measurements
   of ADG were made between birth and slaughter and between 16 and 18 mo of
   age during fattening. Fattening occurred indoors on a complete mixed
   diet fed for ad libitum intake. Meat quality was measured by pH, color,
   and Volodkevitch shear force and by a sensory panel. The repeatability
   of temperament traits was 0.17 (race score), 0.35 (crush score), 0.51
   (flight speed), and 0.36 (isolation score). The proportion of the total
   variance of temperament traits attributable to the sire and the social
   group was low (0.003 to 0.402). However, the sire did affect behavior in
   all tests apart from the crush score (ranging from P = 0.02 to P <
   0.001). Correlations between behavior in the different tests (ranging
   from r = 0.21 to 0.54, and P = 0.02 to P < 0.001) apart from
   between-flight speed and isolation score indicate that fearful behavior
   was consistently shown across assessment methods. A calm response in the
   crush score test was associated with a greater ADG during fattening (P =
   0.05), whereas a calm response during the isolation test was associated
   with a greater ADG in cold carcass weight (P = 0.02). Animals with a
   calm isolation score had less tender meat as judged by the sensory panel
   (P = 0.03), but no other effects were apparent between temperament and
   meat quality measures, although several tendencies (0.06 <= P <= 0.10)
   were found. Temperament did not appear to relate to meat quality in this
   study of frequently handled Bos taurus genotypes, which is in contrast
   to other studies using different beef production systems. Genetic
   correlations between temperament and meat quality under these conditions
   could, although not measured in this study, still exist in the absence
   of phenotypic correlations.}},

   Aggressiveness in the Green Swordtail Xiphophorus helleri}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Aggression occurs when individuals compete over limiting resources.
   While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on
   context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that
   consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that
   aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality.
   Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we
   suggest there is merit in modelling both within-and among-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate
   how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models.
   Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male
   green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of
   (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly
   consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also
   show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects,
   which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be
   context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the
   relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory.
   Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate
   models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried
   functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e. g.,
   mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual
   aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Capture and temporary confinement of wild birds are integral parts of
   wildlife management practice and research used, for example, during
   translocation or reintroduction initiatives. We report here on the
   behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild
   blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly
   consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the
   relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations.
   Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration,
   integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day
   confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 +/- 66.6 (mean +/- S.E.)
   and 678.2 +/- 115.8 ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of
   corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8
   and 2.2 ng/mL respectively, P < 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week
   period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased
   propensity for locomotory behaviours (P = 0.001), maintenance behaviours
   (P = 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P = 0.04) over the period of
   captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P < 0.001) decreased,
   probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated
   decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual
   behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation
   days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability
   (Repeatability = 0.592 +/- 0.084, P < 0.0001). Significant
   repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations
   measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability = 0.619 +/- 0.166, P =
   0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability = 0.368
   +/- 0.166, P = 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We
   used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of
   locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was
   positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response
   at release (P = 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation
   days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P
   = 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days
   after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the
   behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity,
   may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement
   that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. (C) 2011

   model. We assessed the exploratory behavior of individual birds in a

   accompanying motor behavior of both male and female chickadees, over the
   course of several days, in two different contexts: a control condition
   with no playback and a stressful condition where chick-a-dee mobbing
   calls were played to individual birds. We found that several
   vocalizations and behaviors were repeatable within both a control and a
   stressful context, and across contexts. While there was no relationship
   between vocal output and exploratory behavior in the control context,
   production of alarm and chick-a-dee calls in the stressful condition was
   positively associated with exploratory behavior. These findings are
   important because they show that bird calls, in addition to bird song,
   are an aspect of personality, in that calls are consistent both within

Abstract = {{Personality (consistent differences between individuals in behavior) and
   plasticity (changes within individuals in behavior) are often viewed as
   separate and opposing phenomena. We tested this idea by analyzing
   parental care reaction norms in a bird that exhibits biparental care.
   Personality in provisioning behavior existed (r(IC) = 0.11) and
   persisted despite being reduced after accounting for individual
   differences in environment. Plasticity was also evident and differed
   between the sexes. Male visit rate was associated with changes in brood
   size and time of day, but female visit rate was associated with changes
   in nestling age and date. In both sexes changes in visit rate were
   positively correlated with changes in their partner's visit rate. Both
   sexes also exhibited multidimensional reaction norms; interaction terms
   revealed that within-individual visit rates increased more steeply with
   brood size when nestlings were older, and the effect of the partner's
   visit rate was sensitive to variation in date, precipitation, and the
   focal bird's age. Individuals also varied in how they responded
   (reaction norm slope) to changes in nestling age and partner visits.
   Moreover, parental personality was interdependent with individual
   plasticity in several ways. Individuals of both sexes with a high visit
   rate also responded more positively to changes in nestling age, and
   males also showed this pattern with changes in partner visit rate.
   Explicit use of the behavioral reaction norm integrated personality and
   plasticity, revealed that these are not opposing concepts, and
   stimulated new hypotheses about sexual conflict over care and

Abstract = {{Animals of many species show consistency in behaviour across time and

   an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent
   variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living
   species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social
   interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This
   study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive
   chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen
   behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in
   at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable
   long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the
   short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed
   with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of
   which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability',
   `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour
   factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were
   analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor
   scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed
   also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait
   expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a

Abstract = {{It has been established that exposure to xenooestrogens can have
   profound effects on reproductive and aggressive behaviours in aquatic
   organisms. Studies on the effects of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) on
   behaviour, however, rarely examine these effects over multiple trials,
   across time, or across contexts. In addition, it is possible that
   individuals vary in their sensitivity to EE2 and individuals may differ
   in the degree to which their behaviour is affected. The study of
   consistent individual differences in behaviour has grown in popularity
   in recent years perhaps because of the evolutionary questions this
   behavioural variation raises. Adult male threespine stickleback
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from an anadromous population repeatedly
   received the simultaneous presentation of a dummy male and dummy female
   conspecific both before and after exposure to a short-term, nominal (15
   ng L(-1)) concentration of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2). These
   before and after measures were then compared against one another as well
   as against responses of males in a control group that was not exposed to
   EE2. Courtship, aggression, and nesting behaviours were all affected by
   EE2 exposure. In addition, behavioural consistency over trials was
   markedly reduced after EE2 exposure, as shown by lower repeatability
   values in the after exposure measures and in weaker correlations between
   the before and after exposure measures in the EE2 group compared to the
   control group. This suggests that male threespine stickleback vary in
   their sensitivity to EE2. This study is one of the first to examine the
   effects of short-term EE2 exposure on behaviour across trials and has
   important implications for population-level fitness consequences of

   the prey chemical cues and tended to place themselves in low-light
   conditions. However, we detected strong, repeatable differences in
   females' intensity of response, and within-individual variance of
   response (i.e., choosiness) was correlated across situations: females
   with highly consistent responses towards cricket chemical cues also
   exhibited highly consistent responses towards variation in light
   conditions. When deprived of food for extended periods, females were
   indistinguishable in their responses towards prey chemical cues, but
   tended to initiate web construction in brighter lighting conditions.
   Food-deprived females universally exhibited higher variance and
   diminished consistency in their responses (i.e., they were less choosy).
   Additionally, higher choosiness was associated with greater mass loss
   during choice trials, suggesting choosiness is energetically costly. Our
   results demonstrate that consistency of response to environmental cues
   is yet another element of behavior that varies among individuals and
   variation in choosiness could beget speed/quality trade-offs during
   animal decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of female mating preferences is central to the study of
   the evolution of male ornaments. Although several different methods have
   been developed to assess sexual preference in some standardized way, the
   most commonly used procedure consists of recording female spatial
   association with different males presented simultaneously. Sexual
   preference is then inferred from time spent in front of each male.
   However, the extent to which the measurement of female mate-choice is
   related to exploration tendencies has not been addressed so far. In the
   present study we assessed the influence of variation in exploration
   tendencies, a trait closely associated to global personality, on the
   measurement of female mating preference in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia
   guttata) using the widely used four-chamber choice-apparatus. The number
   of movements performed within both exploration and mate-choice apparatus
   was consistent within and across the two contexts. In addition,
   personality explained variation in selectivity, preference strength and
   consistency. High-exploratory females showed lower selectivity, lower
   preference scores and displayed more consistent preference scores. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality may affect the measurement
   of female mating preference and may contribute to explain existing
   inconsistencies across studies.}},

Abstract = {{How animals deal with the challenges posed by their ecological and
   social surroundings often hinges on the acquisition and storage of
   information about those surroundings. That is, an animal's fitness may
   be influenced by variation in the mental representations it has formed

   involves documenting inherently subjective phenomena. However,
   observations of behaviour may provide objective descriptions of mental
   representations. We used the behaviour of Frontinella communis spiders
   after removal of prey from their webs as an assay of the contents of
   their memories of the prey. Spiders searched for lost prey, exerting
   greater effort in searching for larger prey, and distinguishing between
   the object of the search and old prey remnants. We thus infer that
   spider memories included information about prey features such as size or
   quality. We found significant repeatability in the spiders' searching
   behaviour, suggesting repeatability in memory content. As an indication
   of consistent between-individual differences in searching and memory,
   these repeatability estimates suggest that selection may act to shape

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{467-477}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Helpers in cooperatively breeding groups can vary hugely in the variety
   and level of care they provide. Several studies suggest that kin
   selection alone cannot be invoked to explain variation in helping for
   many species, but there have been few explicit tests of this under
   controlled conditions. Here, we investigated whether relatedness to the
   breeding pair or consistent individual differences in behaviours
   explained variation in helping by the cooperatively breeding cichlid
   Neolamprologus pulcher. We established standardized social groups
   consisting of a breeding pair and one related (r = 0.5) and one
   unrelated (r = 0) helper. Two forms of helping, territory maintenance
   and territory defence, were measured repeatedly under controlled
   conditions: helping was variable between, but consistent within,
   individuals. Furthermore, there was some evidence that helpers that
   carried out more maintenance also performed more defence. Contrary to
   the kin selection hypothesis, relatedness did not predict the amount or
   variety of helping executed. Risk responsiveness, activity levels and
   aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals, so constituted
   `behavioural types' (or personality traits), but were uncorrelated with
   each other. More aggressive, risk-prone or more active helpers
   participated in more territory defence than submissive, risk-averse or
   inactive helpers. Risk-prone individuals contributed more to territory
   maintenance than risk-averse helpers. Overall, differences in
   behavioural type, rather than relatedness, explained most variation in
   helping behaviour in N. pulcher. This study highlights the importance of
   considering consistent individual differences in behaviour for
   predicting participation and performance in complex social interactions.

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to compare horses' heart rate (FIR),
   heart rate variability (RMSSD, pNN50) and behaviour in the same
   temperament test when being ridden, led, and released free. Behavioural
   measurements included scores and linear measurements for reactivity (R),
   activity (A), time to calm down (T) and emotionality (E), recorded
   during the approach (1) and/or during confrontation with the stimulus
   (2). Sixty-five horses were each confronted 3 times (1 ridden, 1 led, 1
   free running in balanced order) with 3 novel and/or sudden stimuli.
   Mixed model analysis indicated that leading resulted in the lowest (P <
   0.05 throughout) reactions as measured by A1, A2, El, E2, R2, and pNN50
   while riding produced the strongest (A1, T2, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) or medium
   (El, E2, R2) reactions. Free running resulted either in the strongest
   (A2, El, E2, R2) or in the lowest (A1, 12, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) reactions.
   The repeatability across tests for HR (0.57), but not for RMSSD (0.23)
   or pNN50 (0.25) was higher than for any behavioural measurement: the
   latter ranged from values below 0.10 (A1, A2,T2) to values between 0.30
   and 0.45 (El, E2, R2). Overall, the results show that a rider or handler
   influences, but not completely masks, the horses' intrinsic behaviour in
   a temperament test, and this influence appeared to be stronger on
   behavioural variables and heart rate variability than on the horses'
   heart rates. Taking both practical considerations and repeatabilities
   into account, reactivity appears to be the most valuable parameter.
   Emotionality and heart rate can also yield valid results reflecting
   additional dimensions of temperament although their practical relevance
   may be less obvious. If a combination of observed variables is chosen
   with care, a valid assessment of a horse's temperament may be possible
   in all types of tests. However, in practice, tests that resemble the
   practical circumstances most closely, i.e. testing riding horses under a
   rider, should be chosen. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Feed intake is commonly used as one of the most important performance
   indicators in fish. However, very little is known about the behavioural
   processes involved in ingesting food such as meal duration, feeding
   frequency and latency to start eating. This study aims at the
   characterization of feeding behaviour in Nile tilapia Oreochromis
   niloticus in terms of consistency of individual differences over time
   and correlation with performance traits. Seventy-two individuals were
   individually housed for 27 days. These fish had three different weight
   (age) categories: low (initial body weight: 61.32 +/- 5.97 g), middle
   (151.19 +/- 4.26 g) and high (265.90 +/- 19.13 g), each containing 24
   fish. Daily feed intake was recorded per fish. On days 8, 15 and 21
   feeding behaviour was assessed by measuring the latency to start feeding
   (LAT. min), the total feeding time (TFT, min) and the number of feeding
   acts (NFA). In the end of the experimental period, fish were weighed and
   individual growth rate and feed efficiency (measured as residual feed
   intake) determined. Results show that feeding latency and the number of
   feeding acts have significant repeatability estimates for all weight
   classes. These estimates were, however, low in magnitude and decreased
   as the weight class increased. The correlation between the different
   feeding behaviours showed that individuals that are more active during
   feeding (higher NFA) on average, start to consume their feed earlier
   (lower LAT) and for longer periods (higher TFT). The number of feeding
   acts was significantly correlated with both feed intake and growth in
   all size classes. The residual feed intake was correlated with feeding
   latency only in the small weight class. These results showed that
   individual differences in feeding behaviour have low repeatability
   estimates and can partly explain differences in performance traits in
   juveniles of Nile tilapia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In several bird and mammal species, contact calls are utilized to
   maintain group cohesion and coordinate group movement. From a signal
   design perspective, contact calls typically exhibit acoustic features
   that make them easily localizable and encode information about
   individual or group identity. Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) are
   unusual among vespertilionids in that they often emit a loud, partially
   audible frequency-modulated social call several times in rapid
   succession while in flight. This call appears to function as a contact
   call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and
   perform circular flights before entering a crevice roost. However, the
   degree to which pallid bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and
   what information is provided in the call is unknown. Thus, the goal of
   this study was to investigate pallid bat calling behavior to determine
   if calls attract roostmates or elicit responses from them and provide
   sufficient information for individual recognition. In playback studies,
   we found that contact calls elicit calls and approaches and that
   free-flying bats respond more to familiar than unfamiliar calls. In
   addition, analysis of frequency and temporal measurements of calls
   collected from multiple sites and spectral cross correlation analysis of
   calls recorded from the same radio-tagged bats on multiple evenings
   revealed that the frequency pattern of contact calls is highly
   repeatable over time within individuals but exhibits significant
   differences among individuals. Thus, contact call structure appears to
   be unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these
   calls well-suited for roostmate recognition.}},

Abstract = {{`Animal personality' means that individuals differ from one another in
   either single behaviours or suites of related behaviours in a way that
   is consistent over time. It is usually assumed that such consistent
   individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how
   individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than
   by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat.
   Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect
   `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals
   with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle
   responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether
   personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a
   simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among
   individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three
   week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool
   temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in
   microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a
   range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could
   have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of
   individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A.
   equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may

Abstract = {{The evolution and ecology of consistent behavioural variation, or
   personality, is currently the focus of much attention in natural
   populations. Associations between personality traits and parasite
   infections are increasingly being reported, but the extent to which
   multiple behavioural traits might be associated with parasitism at the
   same time is largely unknown. Here, we use a population of great tits,
   Parus major, to examine whether infection by avian malaria (Plasmodium
   and Leucocytozoon) is associated with three behavioural traits assayed
   under standardized conditions. All of these traits are of broad
   ecological significance and two of them are repeatable or heritable in
   our population. Here, we show weak correlations between some but not all
   of these behavioural traits, and sex-dependent associations between all
   three behavioural traits and parasite infection. Infected males showed
   increased problem-solving performance whereas infected females showed
   reduced performance; furthermore, uninfected females were four times
   more likely to solve problems than uninfected males. Infected females
   were more exploratory than uninfected females, but infection had no
   effect on males. Finally, infected males were more risk-averse than
   uninfected males but females were unaffected. Our results demonstrate
   the potential for complex interactions between consistent personality

Abstract = {{Two divergent behavioural and physiological response patterns to
   challenges have been identified in mammals and birds, frequently termed
   the proactive and reactive coping styles. In recent years, individually
   distinct coping styles have also been observed in several species of
   fish. These individual differences may result in suboptimal production
   and compromised welfare in aquaculture. An approach to overcome these
   problems could be to sort fish and optimise rearing conditions according
   to coping style. It has been previously demonstrated that the proactive
   and reactive coping styles in fish can be characterised by contrasting
   behavioural responses to hypoxia. Two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) strains, bred for a low- (LR) and high- (HR) cortisol response
   to a standardized stressor, are suggested to resemble the proactive and
   reactive coping styles respectively. Therefore, these fish provided an
   opportunity for verifying a method for sorting fish with respect to
   coping style by exposure to hypoxia. Groups consisting of 24
   individually tagged fish, 12 HR and 12 LR were exposed to hypoxia in a
   two choice system. The system consisted of a ``home{''} tank provided
   with cover connected to a second brightly ``illuminated{''} tank via a
   closable doorway. During the experiment, the doorway between the two
   tanks was opened and hypoxic conditions were gradually induced in the
   ``home{''} tank by bubbling with nitrogen. The latency time to move away
   from hypoxic conditions to normoxic conditions in the second tank was
   recorded for each individual. The oxygen saturation in each tank was
   measured every 30 min. The experiment consisted of two trials. Each
   trial was carried out in two sessions, switching the ``home{''} tank and
   ``illuminated{''} tank between Sessions 1 and 2. The results indicated
   that the response to hypoxia differed significantly between LR and HR
   individuals in both Session 1 (P < 0.05) and Session 2 (P <= 0.001).
   Furthermore, a higher number of HR individuals left hypoxic conditions
   compared to LR individuals in both Session 1 (P = 0.001) and Session 2
   (P <= 0.001). Taken together, the findings of the present study
   demonstrate a repeatable difference in behavioural response to hypoxia
   between the two strains. The method presented could be utilized as a
   non-invasive method for sorting fish according to stress coping style.

   in live-trapped meadow voles Microtus pennsylvanicus after controlling
   for the effect of body mass. We quantified the activity levels of voles
   both in an unfamiliar environment and for the first 2 min in the
   metabolic apparatus, and then measured RMR using open-flow respirometry.
   As expected, there was a linear relationship between RMR and body mass,
   and we found strong evidence for repeatable differences in activity
   levels between individuals. However, contrary to the hypothesis, we did
   not identify a significant correlation between CIDs in behaviour and RMR
   after controlling for body mass. Our results suggest that, at least
   within species, higher activity levels may not require a greater
   investment in energetically demanding tissues or increased capacity for
   processing of energy. Alternatively, if a relationship exists, our
   inability to detect it may reflect a weak behavioural signal in noisy
   RMR data that are influenced by many factors. Our results could also
   reflect an artefact of individual responses to stress or a sampling bias
   towards more exploratory individuals in animals captured by
   live-trapping.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence strongly suggests that natural selection can favour the
   evolution of consistent individual differences in behaviour
   ('personalities'). Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has
   been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of
   personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore,
   the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's
   fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a
   factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to
   affect individual success in competition by interference in a few
   species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored.
   We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of
   personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata.
   In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four
   individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play
   producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session,
   individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency
   in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social
   contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success
   during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory
   birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer
   tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were
   presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss
   our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality
   and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the
   evolution of personality. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during development can have long-lasting
   effects on morphology, physiology and behaviour. In contrast to human
   personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences
   the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish,
   Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through
   time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable
   behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social
   conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in
   combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult.
   Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements
   and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest
   mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male.
   Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social
   treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or
   became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was
   not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular
   mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to
   females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult
   were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult
   female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that
   contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and

Abstract = {{Preschool-aged children continually learn new skills and perfect

   test-retest score reliability (preschool-version) and included
   exploratory analysis of test-retest score reliability with a subgroup of
   children with a physical disability. The child's parent completed the
   DMQ twice (30-day mean retest interval) and rated DMQ for ease of use.
   Test-retest score reliability was estimated for DMQ Total, aspect and
   scale scores using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
   Thirty-three mothers participated (children's mean age = 4 years 1
   month, SD = 1 year 2 months). Total score and expressive aspect
   test-retest score reliability were good (ICCs 0.76 and 0.70,
   respectively) and instrumental aspect test-retest score reliability was
   excellent (ICC = 0.87). Five of the 7 scales had ICCs > 0.74. The
   mastery pleasure scale scored lowest in test-retest score reliability
   (ICC = 0.35). Total score test-retest reliability was good for children
   who have a disability (n = 12) and in children typically developing (n =

Abstract = {{Many animals store food in small, widely dispersed scatter hoards or in
   large larder hoards in burrows or other centralized locations. Kangaroo
   rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in
   food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used
   laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding
   by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys
   merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in
   arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and
   individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their
   behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some
   subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both
   species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding
   propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between
   males as well as greater variation between trials for individual
   females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace
   lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's
   kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding
   behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating
   strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache
   pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with
   differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This

Abstract = {{In this study we investigate whether rearing environment (wild vs.
   hatchery) affects the ability of brown trout parr (Salmo trutta) to
   learn two foraging tasks. Hatchery- and wild-reared brown trout were
   trained in two different foraging tasks: locating food hidden in a maze
   and finding a cryptic prey, and their performance within and across
   tasks was compared. Fish reduced their search time for cryptic prey, but
   not maze search time, by learning. In contrast to most previous studies
   hatchery-reared trout generally tended to be more successful feeders and
   showed faster learning than wild trout when foraging on cryptic prey.
   This appeared to be due to motivational effects rather than based on
   cognitive skills. In addition, we examine whether exploration behaviour
   in brown trout is repeatable across time and context (i.e. reflecting a
   behavioural syndrome). Individual exploration tendency was repeatable
   within tasks, suggesting the occurrence of personality in brown trout.
   However, individuals that were fast explorers in the cryptic prey task
   were not necessarily fast to explore the maze. Thus, a context-specific
   behavioural syndrome was found to best explain exploratory behaviour for
   both hatchery and wild trout. However, repeatability of exploration
   behaviour within tasks differed between hatchery and wild trout, where
   wild trout were found to be more consistent in their exploration

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1055-1061}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ in their behavioural reactions to the
   environment. Consistent individual differences in these behaviours
   (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural
   selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in
   physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation
   in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in
   several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for
   personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in
   controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological
   differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might
   cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying
   these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma
   testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced
   immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially
   selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow'
   exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly
   repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the
   season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently
   higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than
   `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for
   variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in
   hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels
   do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels.
   Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of
   selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms
   and the phenotypic traits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Flight speed (FS) is an objective measure of the behavioural response to
   handling procedures in beef cattle but to date there is no published
   work on dairy cattle. It is useful to determine whether there is
   consistency in FS in dairy cattle, and assess the relationship between
   FS and other subjective measures of responsiveness in dairy cattle. The
   aims of this study were to: (a) evaluate the repeatability of the FS and
   crush score (CS) test in dairy cattle by repeated measurements and (b)
   examine the correlation of FS and CS with reactivity responses in a
   human approach test (HAT). FS and CS measurements for 55
   Holstein-Friesian heifers were conducted three times at 4-week
   intervals. Flight response to a HAT was assessed in the passageway of
   the home-pen on a subset of 33 animals. On completion of the HAT, an
   assessment of six qualitative terms (at ease, friendly, bold, docile,
   shy, fearful and nervous) were assessed on a visual analogue scale
   according to a subjective judgement of whether a cow scored low or high
   for each term. Correlations between the three monthly repetitions of FS
   measurements were all significant and positive (FS(1,2): r(s)=0.36,
   P=0.007: FS(2,3): r(s)=0.31, P=0.002: FS(1,3): r(s)=0.47, P<0.001) which
   indicates a level of individual consistency. No significant correlations
   between the three monthly repetitions of CS measurements were found. The
   mean FS was correlated with HAT flight response (r(s)=0.42, P=0.004).
   However, no significant correlations existed between the HAT and the CS.
   In conclusion, the results suggest that both HAT and FS measurements
   provide consistent (both intra- and inter-measure) assessments of

Abstract = {{Current work in behavioral ecology contrasts traditional hypotheses of
   context-specific adaptation with the suggestion that behaviors are often
   coupled such that animals exhibit context-general behavioral syndromes.
   Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is
   a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high
   (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the
   product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted
   spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance.
   Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome
   of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not
   consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider
   the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in
   wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that
   reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across
   the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats
   throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging
   voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2,
   7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition
   alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results
   indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack,
   ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces
   wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither
   repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and
   therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We
   discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of
   predation risk and mate attraction.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioural syndromes have experienced rapid
   increase in interest in the last few years because of their possible
   role in the evolution of life histories. However, there is still a
   scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in
   behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In
   this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on
   the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the
   identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus
   arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of
   family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family)
   on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in
   two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm
   maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The
   study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was
   consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE
   corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed
   behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by
   the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and
   maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family.
   It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here
   is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further
   studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole
   personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the
   opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in
   more natural circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a method of measuring sheep activity in confinement
   based on recording movement of sheep during weighing. The aim was to
   show that an algorithm to analyse continuous weight records could be
   used to measure activity quickly and efficiently using commercial
   weighing equipment and that this measurement is related to animal
   productivity, specifically liveweight. A prototype method required
   magnetic switches on the weighing crate to record gate positioning and
   enclosure of the animal, with data analysis subsequent to the completion
   of weighing. The method reported here does not require additional
   equipment, instead using a computer program to analyse weights in
   real-time to record the degree of sheep movement. The result is
   summarised as the coefficient of variation of the weight over a period
   of 8-20 s and reported as an activity score.
   The real-time method had a higher repeatability (P < 0.05) than the
   prototype method and gave a stronger association with liveweight with
   heavier lambs and heavier young sheep being less active under
   confinement at 6 months and 18 months, respectively (P < 0.05).
   These findings indicate that a simple system could be developed enabling

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences, often referred to as behavioral
   syndromes, are characterized by individuals behaving in a consistent,
   predictable manner while differing from others. This phenomenon appears
   to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or
   changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even
   exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time
   they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few
   studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of
   consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta
   splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with
   a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these
   responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined
   how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of
   conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics.
   Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as
   after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of
   behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter
   their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with
   the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after
   exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed
   behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher
   repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more
   resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral
   strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral
   flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how
   experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to determine relationships between the milk

   hornedness/hornlessness, days from cow placement in the group, number of
   days from last calving, number of days from last oestrus, and number of
   days of pregnancy. The behavioural traits analysed were walking
   activity, the speed of cow approaching the feeding table, the order of
   cow entry into the milking parlour during milking, and cow temperament.
   Considerable repeatability was found for the order of the cows at
   different milkings, with no correlation between this trait and cows'
   milk yield. The speed of cow approaching the feeding table was not

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-108}},
Abstract = {{Individuals select from a number of behaviours when responding to
   various situations and the decisions they make may affect their fitness.
   The costs and benefits of these responses vary among individuals causing
   them to differ even in identical situations. One example of this type of
   situation is when territorial males encounter both a male and female
   simultaneously, generating a trade-off that likely leads to individual
   differences due to differing costs of various actions among males. This
   situation commonly occurs in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus. However, for selection to act effectively, individuals must
   behave in a consistent manner and measuring repeatability can aid in
   understanding how selection may shape such trade-offs. Males of this
   species exhibit consistent individual differences in their response to
   dummy males and females but it is unknown if patterns are similar when
   feedback from the stimuli is present. To assess this, male threespine
   stickleback were tested with dummy and live male and female
   conspecifics, presented separately and simultaneously. While the same
   trends were found regardless of stimulus type, males were more
   aggressive towards the live conspecifics than to the dummies.
   Repeatability values were similar within a treatment regardless of
   whether live or dummy conspecifics were used, suggesting that
   individuals show the same level of consistency. This study adds to our
   understanding of consistent individual differences by demonstrating that
   feedback may not affect responses to conflicting stimuli and that male
   threespine stickleback respond in a consistent manner to both dummy and
   live stimuli {[}Current Zoology 57 (1): 101-108, 2011].}},

Abstract = {{Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated
   behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider
   correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and
   correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity,
   neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy),
   in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent
   personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this
   gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly
   repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of
   them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome.
   Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive
   individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that
   personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing
   within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of
   the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take
   several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual
   personality. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in context-general behavioral
   traits (often called personality traits) are particularly interesting
   for behavioral ecologists because they might show unexpected
   cross-context correlations and explain maladaptive behavior. In order to
   understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the
   heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive
   success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain
   variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to
   novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment.
   Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic
   variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair
   paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and
   nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well
   as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects
   had little influence on these components of reproductive success.
   However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational
   sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel
   object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the
   sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual
   selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We
   conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive
   success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive

Abstract = {{Background: The Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis (ADAD) has been a gold
   standard for assessing drug use and associated problems in adolescents.
   Criticism of the instrument has been increasing. A new instrument, the
   European Adolescent Assessment Dialogue (EuroADAD) that builds on ADAD's
   strengths but seeks to address its limitations is now available, but has
   not been subjected to comprehensive psychometric evaluation. Objective:
   To examine the psychometric properties of the EuroADAD across various
   settings in adolescent populations who developed or were at a high risk
   of developing substance use and psychosocial adaptation problems.
   Participants and Settings: Three of the samples were collected in
   Hungary, including: institutionalized youths from juvenile residential
   facility (n = 295); adolescents from outpatient psychiatry facility (n =
   278), and controls (n = 59). An additional sample was collected in the
   Netherlands, and consisted of adolescent boys from an independent
   residential institution for youth with severe behavioral problems (n =
   51). Procedure: The EuroADAD was administered by trained interviewers.
   Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and self-report
   questionnaires. Results: Reliability: the intraclass correlation was
   high for all domains of the EuroADAD; reliability analyses indicated
   good test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Validity:
   difference among study samples was significant (p < 0.05) for the
   majority of the domains, with juvenile institution and psychiatric
   outpatient subjects exhibiting higher severity in most areas compared to
   controls. The Hungarian and Dutch samples were comparable, expect for
   the legal domain, due to the higher severity of behavioral problems in
   the Dutch sample. Several domains of the instrument, including
   `alcohol', `drugs' and `legal' showed an association with trait
   aggression as measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and
   with Novelty Seeking on the Cloninger Temperament and Character
   Inventory. Conclusion: Based on the pattern and significance of group
   differences, and correlations with other measures, the scale has good
   criterion, and convergent and discriminant construct validity. The
   EuroADAD is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of alcohol and
   drug use, and related psychosocial problems in adolescents. Copyright

   Comparisons of the activity levels showed that both males and females

   the conspecific stimuli). Whereas activity levels were positively
   correlated between their own and the odourless stimuli in both sexes,
   the association between the odourless and conspecific stimuli was

Abstract = {{Personality means an individual's unique way of behaving and reacting to
   the environment. It is a stable and heritable trait, which is expressed
   consistently in different situations. The aim of our study was to
   develop novel tests to depict the personality structure of the bank vole
   Myodes glareolus, and to determine if the phase of the population cycle,
   i.e. population density, affects personality. We focused on some central
   aspects of bank vole behaviour: mobility, risk taking, exploratory
   behaviour, dominance, and aggressive behaviour towards pups. These
   behaviours were chosen because they directly affect bank vole survival
   or fitness or are classified as important factors of personality in
   other species. In total, 192 males from different populations went
   through four behavioural tests, in which 20 variables were measured. The
   tests were repeated after 3 weeks, which verified that all traits were
   stable, i.e. repeatable between trials. Three personality compounds
   emerged, named extroversion, novelty seeking and infanticide.
   Extroversion included dominance and mobility, while novelty seeking
   consisted of risk taking and exploration. Infanticide encompassed all
   indices measuring harmful behaviour towards pups. Mobility and dominance
   were connected, possibly because both seem to depend on condition. Time
   spent in captivity increased extroversion, which may be explained by
   good food, stable conditions and acclimation to strong social cues.
   Novelty seeking was connected to repeatability which could mean that
   novelty avoiding individuals adjust their behaviour to match new
   environments. Population density affected the infanticide trait but not
   novelty seeking or extroversion.}},

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show
   individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and
   context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human
   personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a
   social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a
   behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response
   of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a
   foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower
   colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As
   for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel
   stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to
   known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model,
   we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response
   to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour
   over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used
   here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal
   personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural
   response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day
   basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Although sleep is fundamental for survival, not much is known about
   sleep behaviour in free-living animals and between-individual variation
   in sleep patterns has hardly been studied, except in humans. We analysed
   sleep behaviour in a free-living population of blue tits in southern
   Germany. We recorded individuals roosting in nestboxes between November
   and April using infrared-sensitive cameras. We investigated the
   following sleep parameters: time of entering and leaving the nestbox,
   sleep onset, awakening time, sleep duration, midpoint of sleep, latency
   to sleep and frequency and duration of nocturnal awakenings. Sleep
   onset, awakening time and sleep duration followed seasonal changes in
   daylength. Blue tits slept ca. 4.8 h longer inwinter than in spring.
   During the night, birds woke up between 23 and 230 times, but this did
   not change seasonally. Local light conditions influenced awakening time:
   birds at brighter locations woke up earlier. Females slept on average 15
   min longer per night than males and this sex difference became more
   pronounced in early spring. Although females spent a greater proportion
   of the night awake than males, they still slept more overall. First-year
   birds spent more time in the nestbox after waking up and left the
   nestbox later in the morning than older individuals. Repeatability
   estimates showed that individuals were consistent in their sleep
   behaviour over the 2-year study period. Our results indicate that sleep
   patterns are individual-specific traits in blue tits. We suggest that
   the observed sex difference in sleep duration is caused by sexual

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{905-912}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The open-field test, which measures animal activity or distance covered
   by individuals subjected to a novel arena, is used frequently in
   behaviour studies. Studies generally report consistent individual
   differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested
   whether individuals change their activity level differently within a
   single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability
   of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the
   duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction
   norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in
   temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual
   temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias
   striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the
   total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time
   intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5
   min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain
   differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first
   time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated
   with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests
   yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend
   analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity
   measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are interindividual behavioral differences that are
   consistent across time or contexts. Increasing research is revealing the
   adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving
   this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in
   personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of
   selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured
   indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally
   sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information
   currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability.
   We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common
   personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of
   rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific
   measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of
   hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3
   measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal
   consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed
   was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only
   repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These
   differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the
   correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial
   number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas
   population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel
   environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since
   capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of
   using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of
   personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational
   patterns of trait repeatability.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the
   intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for
   quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of
   phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be
   attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a
   consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the
   sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several
   ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no
   formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for
   non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition
   to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors
   and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability
   estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the
   methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for
   Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three
   common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model
   (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on
   generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation
   of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We
   also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors,
   confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and
   recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests
   and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based
   approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables
   can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of
   repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in
   relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a
   collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate
   repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective force in most natural systems,
   potentially fueling evolutionary changes in prey morphology, life
   history and behaviour. Recent work has suggested that contrasting
   predation pressures may lead to population differentiation in
   personality traits. However, there are indications that these
   personality traits also differ between sexes and not necessarily in a
   consistent way between populations. We used an integrative approach to
   quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught
   guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and
   size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality
   traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on
   emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged
   sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities.
   We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than
   females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was
   non-significant in all populations. We discuss what responses to expect
   from predator-nave versus predator-experienced individuals and how this
   can be linked to the shyness-boldness continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behavior are a widespread

   activity), and/or consume energy (e.g. courtship activity). In doing so,
   we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and
   life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a)
   related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c)

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes describe consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioural traits. Quantifying individual differences
   often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity
   while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared
   behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and
   long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological
   contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was
   similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the
   presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap,
   respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel
   object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of
   annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home
   territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across
   ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a
   behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and
   exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in
   risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a
   familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate
   measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term
   responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in
   related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated
   ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context
   specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome
   sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide

Abstract = {{The ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes is little studied in
   cooperative breeding systems where it is assumed that the behavioural
   type might influence individual decisions on helping and dispersal (e.g.
   shy, nonaggressive and nonexplorative individuals remain philopatric and
   helpful, whereas bold, aggressive, explorative individuals compete for
   vacancies outside their group and disperse). We measured the behavioural
   type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six
   behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different
   contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or
   nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context
   repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal
   individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or
   the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the
   tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits
   per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the
   across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except
   for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the
   context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could
   be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction
   towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies
   in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not
   included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are
   needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration
   propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and
   dispersal). (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Individuals must often decide among a range of behavioral responses in a
   given situation and individuals will likely vary from one another in the
   choices they make. A rarely explored example of this is when both a male
   and a female are present simultaneously and a male must decide to fight
   or court. Consistent individual differences have been found in
   decision-making in Siamese fighting fish: however, dummies were used to
   explore this question and it is possible that individuals respond
   differently in this situation when faced with live stimuli as a result
   of feedback. Therefore, this study investigated whether males behave
   similarly to dummy and live stimuli by exposing them to male and female
   conspecifics both simultaneously and separately. Subjects were tested
   first with dummies and then in the same situations using live
   conspecifics. It was hypothesized that males would respond in the same
   manner to both the dummy and live fish. The results indicated that
   individuals behaved similarly to the dummy fish and the live fish in
   corresponding conditions. In addition, repeatability levels suggest that
   individuals behaved similarly across trials of a given treatment type
   while differing from one another in their responses. This study
   demonstrates that males are consistent in their responses even when
   receiving feedback from conspecifics and supports the continued use of

Abstract = {{Prenatal androgens are generally assumed to permanently affect the

   stability of the AGDI in female mice during pre- (Days 1-21) and
   postweaning (Days 21-61) periods. Presuming that the AGDI reflects a
   permanent effect of prenatal masculinization, we hypothesized that the
   AGDI will be a developmentally stable morphometric measurement
   (interindividual differences in the AGDI measurement should persist over
   time). In contrast to our prediction, the AGDI showed poor repeatability
   both during pre- (.15) and postweaning (.22) periods, indicating

Abstract = {{Resting is important for regeneration and disturbances are welfare
   relevant as they may be associated with insufficient recuperation,

   this study aimed to identify feasible and reliable resting measures in
   terms of inter-observer reliability (IOR) and consistency of results per
   farm over time that can be included in an on-farm welfare assessment
   protocol. Altogether 15 measures were investigated. They were recorded
   during three farms visits (approximately 60 and a further 120 days
   apart) on 35 farms in Austria and Germany with cubicle, deep litter and
   tie stall systems. Seven measures occurred too infrequently (<1/h and
   1\% respectively) to allow reliable recording within a limited
   observation time. IOR was generally acceptable to excellent (Spearman's
   r=0.7-1.0), except for `collision during lying down' with a PABAK of 0.2
   (n = 15, observed on farm). However, after improvement of the definition
   IOR was good (0.78, n=65, observed from videos). Only three measures
   were acceptably repeatable overtime. `duration of lying down' (Kendall's
   W=0.78 for a minimum of 6 recorded occurrences), `percentage of
   collisions during lying down' (W=0.95) and `percentage of cows lying
   partly or completely outside lying area' (W=0.87). These measures are
   evaluated as suitable animal based welfare measures regarding resting
   behaviour in the framework of an on-farm welfare assessment protocol.
   They can be easily and reliably recorded within 2 h during a farm visit
   require only a short training period and show sufficient consistency of
   results over time. They, moreover, allow distinction between different
   housing systems. However their sensitivity with regard to differences
   between individual farms and within farms over time needs further

Abstract = {{Although recent models for the evolution of personality, using game

   differences in cooperative behaviour have rarely been documented. In
   this study, we used a long-term data set on wild meerkats to quantify
   the repeatability of two types of cooperative care (babysitting and
   provisioning) within individuals and examined how repeatability varied
   across age, sex and status categories. Contributions to babysitting and
   provisioning were significantly repeatable and positively correlated
   within individuals, with provisioning more repeatable than babysitting.
   While repeatability of provisioning was relatively invariant across
   categories of individuals, repeatability of babysitting increased with
   age and was higher for subordinates than dominants. These results
   provide support for theoretical predictions that life-history trade-offs

Abstract = {{Individual hormone profiles can be important generators of phenotypic
   variation. Despite this, work on the consequences of hormone profiles
   has traditionally ignored the large inter-individual variation within
   natural populations. However, recent research has advocated the need to
   explicitly consider this variation and address its consequences for
   selection. One of the key steps in this process is examining
   repeatability in hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits
   under selection. In this study we show that individuals within a
   free-ranging population of the Australian lizard Egemia whitii exhibit
   temporal repeatability in their circulating baseline testosterone
   concentrations as well as their aggressive response towards conspecific
   intruders. Furthermore, we show significant, sex-specific links between
   testosterone and aggression. Specifically, testosterone and aggression
   is negatively linked in males, while there is no relationship in
   females. As conspecific aggression has significant consequences for
   fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in this
   species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations,
   through their effects on aggression, could have important implications
   for individual fitness. We discuss the potential causes and consequences
   of hormonal repeatability as well as provide explanations for its
   sex-specific links with aggression. Specifically, we suggest that these
   patterns are the result of alternative hormonal pathways governing
   aggression within Egemia and may indicate a decoupling of aggression and

Abstract = {{Animal temperament describes behavioural differences between individuals
   that are consistent across time and contexts. Variation in animal
   temperament is rapidly gaining interest and attention within behavioural
   and evolutionary ecology. If we are to understand the causes and
   consequences of temperament variation within and between populations we
   need to determine the selection pressures that affect temperament in
   natural environments. To date, however, the vast majority of temperament
   studies have been carried out on captive-bred individuals. This review
   highlights potential problems that arise from using captive animals to
   elucidate the ecological and evolutionary functions of temperament in
   wild populations. For example, development, learning and environmental
   variability can all affect behaviour. Thus, both environment and gene-by
   environment interactions can affect the fitness functions of different
   temperaments, and hence selection. We stress the need for measurements
   of repeatability and heritability, and the importance of biological and
   ecological validation of temperament tests in wild animals. We describe
   the limited evidence from wild populations of the fitness consequences
   of temperament variation, and the use of intra- and inter-specific
   comparisons to prove adaptation. To identify multiple axes of
   behavioural variation, and how these interact with environments that
   vary spatially and temporally, we need long-term studies on wild
   populations - yet few studies of this nature currently exist. Finally,
   and perhaps counter-intuitively, we suggest that there is much to be
   gained from incorporating some of the approaches and statistics employed
   in the much longer established field of human personality.}},

   social environment. However, there is now evidence from a diverse range
   of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad
   behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally
   shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that
   there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We
   aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama
   (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual
   male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome?
   and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with
   individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas
   by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual
   agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder
   males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving
   throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a
   behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home
   ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail
   loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the
   form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We
   suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral
   syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs. Key words: Agama
   planiceps, behavioral syndrome, boldness, individual variation,
   personality. {[}Behav Ecol 21:655-661 (2010)]}},

Abstract = {{Animals must allocate some proportion of their time to detecting
   predators. In birds and mammals, such anti-predator vigilance has been
   well studied, and we know that it may be influenced by a variety of
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite hundreds of studies focusing on
   vigilance and suggestions that there are individual differences in
   vigilance, there have been no prior studies examining its heritability
   in the field. Here, we present one of the first reports of (additive)
   genetic variation in vigilance. Using a restricted maximum likelihood
   procedure, we found that, in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota
   flaviventris), the heritability of locomotor ability (h2 = 0.21), and
   especially vigilance (h2 = 0.08), is low. These modest heritability
   estimates suggest great environmental variation or a history of
   directional selection eliminating genetic variation in these traits. We
   also found a significant phenotypic (r(P) = -0.09 +/- 0.04, P = 0.024)
   and a substantial, but not significant, genetic correlation (r(A) =
   -0.57 +/- 0.28, P = 0.082) between the two traits (slower animals are
   less vigilant while foraging). We found no evidence of differential
   survival or longevity associated with particular phenotypes of either
   trait. The genetic correlation may persist because of environmental
   heterogeneity and genotype-by-environment interactions maintaining the
   correlation, or because there are two ways to solve the problem of
   foraging in exposed areas: be very vigilant and rely on early detection
   coupled with speed to escape, or reduce vigilance to minimize time spent
   in an exposed location. Both strategies seem to be equally successful,
   and this `locomotor ability-wariness' syndrome may therefore allow slow
   animals to compensate behaviourally for their impaired locomotor
   ability.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often consistently differ in personalities and behaviours

   distance (FID) has been measured in a variety of taxa as an estimate of

   FID has been used to test life-history trade-offs related to
   anti-predatory behaviour and for conservation purposes such as to
   establish buffer zones to minimize human disturbance, given its
   species-specific consistency. Individual consistency in FID, however,
   has been largely overlooked. Here we show that, even after controlling

   component (repeatability = 0.84-0.92) in a bird species, leaving a small
   margin for behavioural flexibility. We hypothesize that individuals may
   distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their individual
   susceptibility to human disturbance. This habitat selection hypothesis
   merits further research, given its implications on both evolutionary and
   applied ecology research. For example, selection of human-tolerant

Abstract = {{One function of aggression in animals is to gain access to mates.
   Aggression may therefore be favoured by sexual selection, the strength

   Here, we tested the hypotheses that male swordtails, Xiphophorus sp.,

   that aggressive males gain increased opportunity to attempt copulation

   frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not
   significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The function of
   aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect

   the contradictory results for consistency in female contact, with high

Abstract = {{To investigate the ecological significance of personality, researchers
   generally measure behavioural traits in captivity. Whether behaviour in
   captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom
   tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild
   in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were
   briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and
   neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then
   released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an
   electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of
   feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery
   of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild.
   At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia
   in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was
   independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or
   weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual
   exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in
   captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all
   constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or
   the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in
   contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia
   measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured
   in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities,
   personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in
   foraging behaviour between individuals. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food
   or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or

   suitable tests that could be used to measure the sociability of

   as a ``gold standard{''} test of social motivation and was repeated
   three times on 46 focal cows. In the runway test, the average latency to
   reach 5 m and 2 m from the herd and the time spent in these areas were
   recorded and analysed for repeatability. Latency to reach the 5 m line
   over the three tests was the most repeatable variable (0.54) and was
   taken as a measure of social motivation against which to assess other
   measures of sociability shown by the cows in their home-pen. The
   home-pen measures were the distance of each cow to the two nearest
   neighbours, location of the cow in the cow shed, and the level of
   synchrony based on individual behaviour of each focal cow compared with
   the rest of the herd's behaviour. Cows that had high latencies to reach

   for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and
   manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three

   increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However,
   whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across
   temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the
   individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality.
   In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature
   contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended
   to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the
   importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying

   lower than those generally reported in research studies. Of greater
   concern, Factor 1 scores were only negligibly related to each other
   (ICC(A,1) = .16). Correcting for potential range restriction among these

Pages = {{367-382}},
Abstract = {{The lifecycles of parasites are often complex, with multiple successive
   hosts. Many parasites have evolved the ability to modify the behaviour
   of their present host to increase the chance of transmission to the next
   host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related
   behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic
   manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two
   trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the
   behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a
   behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the
   correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural
   traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted:
   phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical
   distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect
   on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods
   infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly,
   amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural
   correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts.
   Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected
   amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these
   results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome
   framework.}},

Pages = {{273-276}},
Abstract = {{The extent and importance of consistent individual differences in
   behaviour, often referred to as `personality' or `temperament', is a
   relatively recent question in ecology. It indicates that animal
   behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that
   individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to
   changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a
   wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but
   there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine
   fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural
   traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P.
   unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in
   boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but
   average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A
   correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder
   individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of
   personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as
   sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality
   and life-history traits that affect fitness.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{P> Temperament traits increasingly provide a focus for investigating the
   evolutionary ecology of behavioural variation. Here, we examine the
   underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in
   the temperament trait `exploration behaviour in a novel environment'
   (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a
   passerine bird, the great tit Parus major.
   First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a
   restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term
   pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only
   moderately heritable and permanent environment (V(PE)) effects
   contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects.
   We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various
   temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive
   success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting
   on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment,
   but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no
   evidence of any selection on EB through survival.
   Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst
   males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients -
   local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any
   previous equivalent demonstrations.
   All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration
   behaviour (EB(2), measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate
   comparison with other studies. EB and EB(2) were strongly correlated to
   one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at
   the phenotypic level and V(PE) was undetected in EB(2). Selection on
   EB(2) was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are
   broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective.
   Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait
   `exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this
   population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident
   along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong V(PE) effect
   detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of
   variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an
   environmental context.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study tests the two main characteristics of a temperament trait,
   consistency across time and consistency across situations. The
   temperament trait of interest was aggressiveness during feeding in dairy
   cattle. In this study, we focused on whether it is possible to infer a
   trait of aggressiveness from the measurement of behavioural responses
   expressed by individual cows during feeding. Aggressive behaviour
   appears in many contexts but this paper focuses on aggressive behaviour
   in a competitive situation over a feed resource in housed dairy cattle.
   It is important that we fully understand within-cow consistency of
   aggressiveness in different competitive and social situations. To
   achieve this the following questions were investigated: (1) are cows
   consistent in how they express aggressive behaviour over time? (2) and
   across situations at a standard and reduced (competitive) feedface? The
   aim of this study was to measure the behavioural reactions of housed
   dairy cattle during feeding in a way that can be practically and easily
   recorded on commercial farms. Ten primiparous and 30 multiparous healthy
   lactating cows were housed in a group (parity = 3.5 +/- 2.15; mean +/-
   S.D.). The behaviour of the aggressor and recipient was recorded for
   each aggressive interaction for 60 min after feed arrival. Repeatability
   estimates and Kendall's coefficient of concordance were both used to
   assess consistency of aggressor and recipient behaviours across time.
   The within-cow repeatability was highest for `aggressive index' (r=0.31)
   and lowest for non-response behaviours (r=0.04) across time.
   Individual's responses to the standard and reduced feedface were
   significantly correlated for contact and non-contact behaviours. These
   results highlight the complexity of aggressive style of cows during
   feeding and illustrate that some measures of aggressive feeding
   behaviour are repeatable within cows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. - Social functioning is a primordial aspect of mental health
   and it should be considered as an important outcome measure in
   psychiatric treatments and studies. Few short and simple assessment
   instruments are available in French. Recently, the Questionnaire de
   Fonctionnement Social (QFS) was developed to study social behavior of
   psychiatric patients. The QFS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire
   assessing the frequency of and the satisfaction with social behavior
   during the last two weeks. The aim of the present study is to explore
   QFS psychometric properties in a sample of patients with borderline
   personality disorder.
   Methods. - Eighty-six outpatients (78 women and eight men, mean age:
   30.5 +/- 8.6) with borderline personality disorder and 100 healthy
   matched control subjects (89 women and 11 men, mean age: 30.2 +/- 7.7)
   completed the QFS. The convergent and divergent validities of the QFS
   were tested with the following instruments: Social Adaptation
   Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and a visual
   scale of suffering (EVS). Test-retest reliability of the QFS was
   calculated in a sub-sample of 28 subjects and its sensitivity to change
   was measured for 45 patients.
   Results. - Internal consistency of the QFS' global index was satisfying
   (Cronbach alpha from 0.59 to 0.84). Test-retest reliability of the QFS
   indexes ranged from 0.77 to 0.79 (intraclass correlation coefficient).
   Correlations between QFS and SASS demonstrated moderate convergent
   validity (r > 0.59) whilst associations with others psychological
   measures (BSI, BDI, BHS, EVS) showed satisfying divergent validity
   (-0.42 < r < -0.12). Discriminate validity was excellent as the group of
   healthy control subjects scored significantly higher than the group of
   patients in all variables (Mann-Whitney all p < 0.001). QFS sensitivity
   to change after psychotherapeutic treatment was good as shown by the
   significant change observed in Frequency and Satisfaction index
   (Wilcoxon respectively p = 0.002 and p < 0.001).
   Conclusion. - The QFS demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in
   the studied population. This study confirms it is a valuable tool. to
   assess social functioning of borderline personality disorder patients.

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Many behaviours cannot be performed simultaneously, which forces animals
   to decide which behaviour to perform. In a behavioural trade-off,
   individuals should act as if they have weighed these alternatives before
   acting. Because the costs and benefits of performing specific behaviours
   are likely to differ between individuals as a result of different
   environmental and/or genetic backgrounds, individuals should vary in the
   decisions they make. Male threespine stickleback establish territories
   and nest close to one another; thus, they may be faced with a decision:
   fight a potential rival male or court a female. To assess how males
   respond to the presence of conflicting stimuli, males were presented
   with a dummy female alone, a dummy male alone, a dummy male and a dummy
   female simultaneously, and two dummy females simultaneously.
   Repeatability scores indicated that individuals were consistent in their
   responses to a given stimulus within a treatment yet differed from one
   another in their responses. For example, some males were more vigorous
   courters than others. In the female-male treatment, some males focused
   on only one of the stimuli while others divided their time between the
   two. This finding suggests that males may use different strategies when
   conflicting stimuli are present. Few studies have empirically examined
   the choices that territorial males make when these competing options are
   presented simultaneously, even though this situation is probably common
   in the wild. This study provides insight into male decision making when
   stimuli that elicit mutually incompatible behaviours are present and
   suggests that there may be a genetic basis to these differences. (C)

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that
   behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and
   context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among
   individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that
   some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship
   between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured
   several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese,
   Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of
   individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to
   an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a
   leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in
   pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability
   for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly
   correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity
   or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that
   leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality.
   Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected
   not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by
   the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that
   movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the
   personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement
   patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types
   present in the group. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{The social fine structure of a population plays a central role in
   ecological and evolutionary processes. Whilst many studies have
   investigated how morphological traits such as size affect social
   structure of populations, comparatively little is known about the
   influence of behaviours such as boldness and shyness. Using information
   on social interactions in a wild population of Trinidadian guppies

   individual in the network, we quantify its behavioural phenotype using
   two measures of boldness, predator inspection tendency, a repeatable and
   reliably measured behaviour well studied in the context of co-operation,
   and shoaling tendency. We observe striking heterogeneity in contact
   patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties
   negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy
   fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on
   average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly
   influenced by behavioural trait. We assert that such structure will have
   implications for the outcome of selection on behavioural traits and we
   speculate that the observed positive assortment may act as an amplifier
   of selection contributing to the maintenance of co-operation during

Abstract = {{Studying the causes and correlates of natural variation in gene
   expression in healthy populations assumes that individual differences in
   gene expression can be reliably and stably assessed across time.
   However, this is yet to be established. We examined 4-hour test-retest
   reliability and 10 month test-retest stability of individual differences
   in gene expression in ten 12-year-old children. Blood was collected on
   four occasions: 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Day 1 and 10 months later at 10
   a.m. and 2 p.m. Total RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix-U133 plus 2.0
   arrays. For each probeset, the correlation across individuals between 10
   a.m. and 2 p.m. on Day 1 estimates test-retest reliability. We
   identified 3,414 variable and abundantly expressed probesets whose
   4-hour test-retest reliability exceeded .70, a conventionally accepted
   level of reliability, which we had 80\% power to detect. Of the 3,414
   reliable probesets, 1,752 were also significantly reliable 10 months
   later. We assessed the long-term stability of individual differences in
   gene expression by correlating the average expression level for each
   probe-set across the two 4-hour assessments on Day 1 with the average
   level of each probe-set across the two 4-hour assessments 10 months
   later. 1,291 (73.7\%) of the 1,752 probe-sets that reliably detected
   individual differences across 4 hours on two occasions, 10 months apart,
   also stably detected individual differences across 10 months.
   Heritability, as estimated from the MZ twin intraclass correlations, is
   twice as high for the 1,752 reliable probesets versus all present
   probesets on the array (0.68 vs 0.34), and is even higher (0.76) for the
   1,291 reliable probesets that are also stable across 10 months. The
   1,291 probesets that reliably detect individual differences from a
   single peripheral blood collection and stably detect individual
   differences over 10 months are promising targets for research on the
   causes (e.g., eQTLs) and correlates (e.g., psychopathology) of
   individual differences in gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Suites of correlated behaviors, or ``behavioral syndromes,{''} have been
   shown to occur throughout the animal kingdom. Behavioral syndromes
   involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary
   ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to
   sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches
   (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice,
   and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified
   between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression
   directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an
   opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals
   exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction.
   Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior
   in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In
   contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing
   cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context.
   Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call
   ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between
   courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship
   directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context.
   Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive
   success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual
   selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context,
   may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are thought to adjust their behavior optimally to any given

   (244 females with 482 breeding attempts) breeding in a highly variable
   environment created by fluctuations in the abundance of their main prey
   (field and bank voles) across years. Ural owls were more aggressive when
   voles were increasing in density as well as when the Ural owls had large
   brood sizes and laid early in the season. Aggressive nest defense was
   highly repeatable between breeding attempts (r = 0.52 +/- 0.05 standard

   which they adjusted the level of their aggression to the varying food
   conditions). Fierce nest defenders produced more recruits to the local
   breeding population, but a female's survival was not affected by her
   intensity of nest defense. A path analysis revealed that nest defense
   aggressiveness, rather than its correlates vole abundance, brood size,

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, defined as consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioral traits, are suggested to be common in the
   animal kingdom and can have important fitness consequences. Individual
   differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be
   part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect
   an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such
   environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study
   because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental
   sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration
   behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species.
   Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that
   individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the
   parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile
   wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was
   measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of
   exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly
   predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding
   exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings,
   behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better
   predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the
   relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be
   easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to
   exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity
   correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further
   highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic
   plasticity in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately evaluating and selecting for calm temperament in beef cattle
   is important for economic and animal welfare reasons. Previous studies
   have shown that eye white (EW) can be a predictor of a multitude of
   emotions across different situations, but there is little research on
   the relationship between EW and temperament. The objective of this
   experiment was to assess the accuracy and reliability of using the
   percentage of exposed EW as a predictor of temperament in beef cattle.
   Forty-eight heifers (group 1), 39 bulls (group 2), and 60 steers (group
   3) were video-recorded while in a squeeze chute, and 2 still digital
   images from each animal were selected for EW determination. Chute
   temperament scores were assigned: 1 (calm) to 5 (agitated). Flight
   speeds were measured blindly and independently during a subsequent test
   in which the amount of time it took a solitary animal to pass a handler
   and travel a specified distance was recorded. The EW area in each image
   was measured using Sigmascan Pro 5 and was expressed as the percentage
   of exposed eye area. Each image was analyzed twice to determine tracing
   repeatability. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among 2
   images of the same animal, as well as among duplicate readings of the
   same image to determine animal and tracing repeatabilities. The mean
   percentages of EW were 30.14 +/- 14.37, 31.43 +/- 14.77, and 28.57 +/-
   12.38, and the average percentage accuracy for duplicate image EW
   measures was 96, 96, and 93 (P < 0.0001) for groups 1, 2, and 3,
   respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for EW percentage and
   chute temperament scores were 0.674 (P < 0.0001), 0.95 (P < 0.0001), and
   0.696 (P < 0.0001), whereas the correlations between EW and flight
   speeds were 0.415 (P < 0.0001), 0.333 (P < 0.05), and 0.294 (P < 0.01)
   for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Results from this study indicate
   that percentage EW in cattle could be used as a quantitative tool with
   minimal equipment to assess temperament in beef cattle, providing an
   objective method for temperament selection.}},

Abstract = {{Despite burgeoning interest in consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (animal `personality'), the influence of social interactions
   on the performance of different behavioural types is poorly understood.
   Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality
   differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the
   possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit
   personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received
   serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing
   selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch,
   we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration)
   between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts,
   the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex
   companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to
   behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of
   individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more
   exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory
   tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently
   across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though
   individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory
   behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion,
   the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of
   exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also
   affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results
   stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and
   of considering the influence of social context in animal personality
   studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of
   the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in individual differences in animal

   factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use
   meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more

Abstract = {{If variation in behaviour is consistent within individuals and reliably
   associated with relevant welfare measures, this variation could aid in
   genetic selection, or development of management schemes designed to
   improve welfare. In this study, we focused on temperament tests in
   group-housed finishing pigs, with the objective of validating measures
   that are readily applicable in commercial settings and potentially
   related to individual differences in stress response. A total of 118
   pigs in two replicate studies were housed in pens of 7-8 pigs per pen.
   At 24 weeks of age, animals were subjected to three tests of fear in the
   home pen: the human approach test (HAT), novel object test (NOT) and
   open door test(ODT). In each test, pigs were scored on their latency to
   contact the human or object, or to leave the home pen. Tests were
   repeated on three occasions at intervals of 3-4 days. On each test day
   the HAT was performed twice to compare results between different
   handlers. Behaviour in tests of fear was compared with two social tests
   in a subset of 58 pigs. Lesion scoring was performed after mixing as a
   measure of aggression, and a feed competition test was used to assess
   social status. Repeatability within-test was evaluated in a mixed model
   with pig as a random effect, and agreement between days, handlers and
   tests was evaluated by partial correlations after controlling for
   replicate, pen and day effects. Latency to perform all three fear tests
   decreased significantly over time. Correlations within-test showed
   significant agreement between all days for HAT and ODT, and between HAT
   handlers. Between tests, the HAT and ODT were correlated, and ODT and
   NOT tended to correlate. Comparisons between group fear tests and social
   tests showed that pigs which readily approach a human tended to have
   higher lesion scores and fewer feeding bouts in the feed competition
   trial. While test latencies decrease with repetition, the HAT and ODT
   show individual consistency over time, which suggests that these tests
   describe behavioural tendencies and may be useful for predicting fearful
   responses at slaughter. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. The response of dispersal towards evolution largely depends on its

   2. In the Linyphiid spider E. atra, we were able to separate long- and

   3. Ballooning motivation can be regarded as highly individual-specific

Abstract = {{Interest in personality is growing in a wide range of disciplines, but
   only in a few systems it is possible to assess the survival value of
   personality. Field studies looking at the relationship between
   personality and survival value early in life are greatly hampered by the
   fact that personality can at present only be assessed after individuals
   become independent from their parents. In passerines, for example, this
   is often after a period of intensive selection for the survival on
   fledglings. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop a method
   to measure personality before this period of selection. For this
   purpose, we developed the handling stress (HS) test. We measured HS in
   14-d-old great tit nestlings by counting the number of breast movements
   (breath rate) in four subsequent 15-s bouts for 1 min; before and after
   they were socially isolated from their siblings for 15 min. To calculate
   the repeatability of HS, we repeated the test 6 mo later. To assess the
   relationship between HS and exploratory behaviour, we correlated the
   outcome of both tests. We ran tests both on birds of lines selected for
   extreme personality and on wild birds from a natural population. We
   found that birds selected for fast exploration reacted more to HS
   compared with birds selected for slow exploration and that HS was
   repeatable in different life phases. We confirmed this by finding an
   increase in the HS with increasing exploratory scores in wild birds.
   These results show that we can use the HS test as a measurement of
   personality, making it a potential tool for studying the relationship
   between personality and survival value early in life.}},

Abstract = {{Social foragers can alternate between searching for food (producer
   tactic), and searching for other individuals that have located food in
   order to join them (scrounger tactic). Both tactics yield equal rewards
   on average, but the rewards generated by producer are more variable. A
   dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers
   should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy
   requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging
   period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy
   requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with
   differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female
   zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic
   variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater
   use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However,
   we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating
   that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our
   experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that
   variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in
   foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are
   consistent with phenotype-dependent tactic use decisions. We suggest
   that BMR is correlated with another phenotypic trait which itself
   influences tactic use decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives: The activity of behavioral inhibition and
   activation systems (BIS and BAS) has been related to several mental
   disorders. The availability of a validated questionnaire to assess BIS
   and BAS over the telephone could aid research. The objective of the
   present study was to evaluate the procedural validity of telephone
   administration of the sensitivity to punishment/sensitivity to reward
   questionnaire (SPSRQ) as a measure of BIS and BAS activity (by means of
   its two scales: the sensitivity to punishment {[}SP] scale and the
   sensitivity to reward {[}SR] scale).
   Methods: A total of 231 participants were assessed with the SPSRQ twice
   (over the telephone and in a self-administered format). Intraclass
   correlation coefficients and kappa indices were calculated.
   Additionally, possible differences between the mean scores obtained with
   the two assessment procedures and internal consistency were explored.
   Results: Telephone and self-assessment of BIS and BAS, by means of the
   SPSRQ, provided similar results, supporting the procedural validity of
   telephone administration. A slight but statistically significant
   tendency (estimated betha = 0.62; 95\% Cl, 0.33-0.92; p < 0.001) toward
   lower scores was observed for the telephone-administered SP scale and
   for the interaction ``first or second assessment/telephone or
   self-administered SPSRQ{''} for the SR scale (p = 0.023).
   Conclusions: The results of the present study support the reliability of
   telephone assessment of BIS and BAS by means of the SPSRQ. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{In many farm animal species, the relationship to humans affects their
   welfare considerably. But until now, on-farm studies on fattening bulls
   have been limited. A feasible, reliable methodology for assessing
   responses of bulls to humans Would be helpful for large scale surveys on
   this topic. Measuring avoidance distance at the feeding place (ADF) to
   assess animals' relationship to humans was shown to be a feasible and
   stable measure in dairy cow herds. So, the main objective of this study
   was to investigate reliability aspects of measuring avoidance distance
   at the feeding place towards an unknown experimenter on bull fattening
   farms. Moreover, we were interested in the potential confounding factor
   age of animals, and, on a preliminary level, a possible relationship of
   responsiveness of bulls to farmers' attitudes. With regard to
   reliability, between-experimenter repeatability - the repeatability of
   ADF when carried out by different experimenters within short time - was
   evaluated by two experimenters in a balanced order with 602 fattening
   bulls on 10 farms. The experimenter was both the stimulus person and the
   person collecting the data. Between-experimenter repeatability was
   analysed at an individual and at farm level. We recorded the median and
   mean values of avoidance distances {[}ADF median, ADF mean] per farm and
   the percentages of bulls accepting to be touched {[}ADF \% touch] or
   showing avoidance distances greater than 20 cm {[}ADF \% > 0.2 m].
   Inter-observer reliability, based on individual observations recorded by
   an experimenter and an observer simultaneously, was tested on six farms.
   Farmers were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess their
   attitudes (behavioural beliefs and affective attitudes) towards
   interacting with bulls.
   Generally, inter-observer reliability for ADF was high (r(s) > 0.9, n =
   288/297). At an individual level, moderate between-experimenter
   repeatability could be attained (r(s) = 0.6, n = 469). At farm level (n
   = 10), Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)) for
   between-experimenter repeatability ranged from >0.4 to 0.7. A low
   negative correlation was found between ADF and age at an individual
   level (r(s) = -0.14, P = 0.015, n = 320). Despite the rather low range
   of avoidance distances observed between farms, ADF correlated
   significantly with some of the farmers' attitudes. ADF was lower in case
   of farmers expressing more positive affective attitudes towards contacts
   with the animals (significantly so for the measures ADF mean and ADF \%
   > 0.2 m {[}P < 0.05]).
   In conclusion, the use of the avoidance distance test at the feeding
   place (ADF) is promising for assessing the responses of fattening bulls
   to humans due to its feasibility, reliability and sensitivity both at an
   individual and at farm level. Based on a limited number of farms, our
   first exploration of the relationships between farmers' attitudes and
   responses of bulls to humans in the home environment suggests possible
   links that require further investigations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, evidence for interindividual variation in
   ``personality{''} within animal populations has been accumulating.
   Personality is defined as consistency in an individual's behavioral
   responses over time and/or across situations. One personality trait that
   has potentially far-reaching implications for behavioral ecology, and
   may provide insight into the mechanisms by which consistent behavioral
   correlations arise, is that of boldness. Boldness is defined as the
   tendency of an individual to take risks and be exploratory in novel
   contexts. Using the framework of behavioral syndromes, we tested for
   individual differences in boldness in the laboratory among field-caught
   juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) within and across the
   contexts of exploratory behavior, activity, and risk taking (e.g.,
   antipredator) behavior. After such testing, individuals were tagged and
   returned to their lake of origin as part of a mark-recapture study
   testing for the repeatability of individual differences in boldness.
   Here, we report strong and consistent individual differences in boldness
   within and across all 3 behavioral contexts. Additionally, we observed
   that at least some boldness behaviors were repeatable after a 1-3 month
   recapture period. This study provides novel evidence for a boldness
   syndrome in sunfish, as well as insight into how behavioral types (e.g.,
   shy/bold) may evolve and be maintained in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Nest defense represents a parental strategy to maximize fitness by

   2003 and 2004 to test the hypotheses that intensity of nest defense (I)
   was individually repeatable, (2) differed between males and females. and
   (3) predicted nest success. We also predicted that (4) intensity of
   defense would increase with age and number of young, but decline over
   the breeding season. Intensity of nest defense was significantly
   repeatable for male kingbirds. Male response was twice as strong as
   female response during incubation and the nestling period, but nest
   success was independent of defense scores of males and females. Simple
   paired comparisons suggested leniale responses did not change between
   incubation and the nestling period, whereas males tended to defend
   nestlings more vigorously than eggs. Multivariate analyses demonstrated
   strong individual differences were the main source of variation in nest
   defense. Intensity of nest defense by males and females increased with
   age of young, declined seasonally, but was not related to number of
   young. Kingbird nest defense is a repeatable behavior that differs
   between males and females and, as predicted by parental investment

Abstract = {{This study investigated intra-test and inter-test consistency of dairy
   cattle behavioural responses to a series of tests involving human
   approach and exposure to novelty. Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian
   cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel
   stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter
   approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP),
   lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was
   repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability
   estimates were 0,65,0.40,0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively.
   Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by
   comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate
   consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach
   tests (W(35) - 0.56, P < 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray,
   striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to
   each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were
   assessed. Cows showed the greatest reactivity response to the water
   spray compared to the striped boards (U(1) - 56, P < 0.001) and flashing
   light (U(1) - 66, P < 0.001). No statistically significant agreement
   existed between the novel stimuli reactivity and investigatory responses

   consistency between human approach situations was shown, however,
   consistency between human and novel situations was not found. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Behavioural problems in dogs are it major cause for their relinquishment
   and return to animal shelters and rehoming centres. It is important that
   the staff in these welfare centres can reliably assess the behavioural
   characteristics of the dogs so that they can be rehomed to the most
   appropriate environment and the owners can be made aware of what to
   expect. There have been very few studies which have assessed the
   reliability of the assessment of dogs' behavioural responses; therefore
   this study was conducted to assess the inter-rater reproducibility and
   intra-rater repeatability of the assessment of behavioural responses of
   dogs by staff at a UK dog welfare charity.
   Forty members of staff at Dogs Trust, a UK dog welfare charity, were
   asked to assess 20 dogs based on the dogs' behaviour recorded on video.
   They were then asked to repeat these assessments 2 months after they had
   completed the first assessments using the same video. The data were then
   analysed for inter-rater reproducibility and intra-rater repeatability
   using the weighted kappa statistic. It wits found that there was a
   moderate level of agreement between staff in their assessment of the
   dogs' behavioural responses to a person `approaching their kennel' and a
   poor to moderate level of agreement for behavioural responses to
   `general handling and grooming'. Additionally, there was only a
   low-level of agreement for many of the responses to a dog `meeting
   another dog' and this may have been due to the small number of dogs that
   were able to be assessed in this situation. The inter-rater
   reproducibility was greater when the analysis was restricted to those
   members of staff who had formal training or more than 8 years of
   experience. The intra-rater repeatability was generally moderate to high
   in all cases indicating it good consistency by members of staff over
   time.
   The current study shows that there is an overall moderate level of
   agreement amongst staff but as they gain experience and training their
   level of agreement tends to increase. This study also highlighted the
   need for the standardisation of the assessments currently used. It is
   important that staff are able to consistently identify behavioural
   characteristics of dogs in order to provide the best chance of a
   successful adoption. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of many species differ consistently in their behavioral
   reactions toward different stimuli, such as predators, rivals, and
   potential mates. These typical reactions, described as `behavioral
   syndromes' or `personalities,' appear to be heritable and therefore
   subject to selection. We studied behavioral syndromes in 36 male fowl
   living in 12 social groups and found that individuals behaved
   consistently over time. Furthermore, responses to different contexts
   (anti-predator, foraging, and territorial) were inter-correlated,
   suggesting that males exhibited comparable behavioral traits in these
   functionally distinct situations. We subsequently isolated the same
   roosters and conducted tests in a `virtual environment,' using
   high-resolution digital video sequences to simulate the anti-predator,
   foraging, and territorial contexts that they had experienced outdoors.
   Under these controlled conditions, repeatability persisted but
   individual responses to the three classes of stimuli failed to predict
   one another. These were instead context-specific. In particular,
   production of each type of vocal signal was independent, implying that
   calls in the repertoire are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Our
   results show that extrinsic factors, such as social position, can be
   responsible for the appearance of traits that could readily be mistaken
   for the product of endogenous characters.}},

Abstract = {{Although individual variation is a key requirement for natural

   individual variation in endocrine systems or the functional significance
   of that variation. Here we describe (1) the extent and repeatability of
   inter-individual variation in adrenocortical responses and (2) its
   relationship to sex-specific phenotypic quality, such as song duration
   and frequency and timing of egg laying. We measured adrenocortical
   responses to a standardized stressor in zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata) at two life history stages: similar to day 16 (nestlings) and 3
   months of age (sexually mature adults). Subsequently, we assessed
   phenotypic (reproductive) quality of all individuals as adults. Marked
   inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical response was seen in
   both sexes and ages, e.g., stress-induced corticosterone ranged from 2.2
   to 62.5 ng/mL in nestlings and 5.0-64.0 ng/mL in adults. We found sex
   differences in (a) inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical
   response, (b) repeatability, and (c) relationships between
   corticosterone levels and phenotypic quality. In males, variation in
   nestling corticosterone was weakly but positively correlated with brood
   size and negatively correlated with nestling mass (though this

   correlation of adrenocortical responses between two stages in males and
   adult phenotypic quality was significantly correlated only with adult
   corticosterone levels. In contrast, in females there was no relationship
   between nestling corticosterone and brood size or mass but
   adrenocortical response was repeatable between two stages (r(2) =0.413).

Abstract = {{Structures built by animals may convey useful information about the
   builder that may be used by conspecifics in quality assessment. In fish,
   nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual
   builders, but little is known about how consistent individual
   differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect
   builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals
   in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male
   three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the
   repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from
   four populations in mid-Wales, U.K., to complete three consecutive nests
   under standardized laboratory conditions. We quantified a number of
   structural components and design characteristics of nests and estimated
   repeatability (r) of these traits. Within populations, the number of
   threads used, the area of the nest and the mass of substrate deposited
   on top of the nest were all repeatable within males (0.39 < r < 0.51),
   showing that individual male three-spined sticklebacks differed
   consistently in the size and composition of the nests they produced. Our
   data support the hypothesis that nest characteristics may reveal
   important information about the quality of individual males, and that
   they may, at least in part, be under genetic control. We discuss these
   findings in the context of the evolution of nest characteristics in
   sticklebacks and other species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study

   sample of 58 methadone maintenance patients.
   Results: Internal consistency was modest, but similar to the original
   value (alpha = 0.62), and test-retest correlation at four months
   follow-up was moderately encouraging for a short instrument such as this
   (n = 31, test retest intraclass correlation = 0.58), and change at the
   mean level was minimal, but marginally significant (from an average of
   3.3 to 3.8, p = 0.06). Analyses of nurse ratings of patients' behaviour
   at the clinic showed that SAPAS was significantly correlated with nurse
   ratings of externalizing behaviour (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), and Global
   Assessment of Functioning (r = -0.36, p = 0.006), but unrelated to
   intoxication (r = 0.02, NS), or withdrawal (r = 0.20, NS).
   Conclusion: There is evidence that the SAPAS is a modestly valid and
   relatively reliable brief screening measure of personality disorders in
   patients with ongoing substance abuse undergoing methadone maintenance.
   It can be used in situations where limited resources are available, and
   researchers or others wish to get an impression of the degree of
   personality pathology in a clinical population, as well as for screening
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among individuals in mate choice has important implications
   for the evolution of sexually selected traits. For example, it offers an
   explanation for the continued existence of heritable genetic variation
   in sexually selected male traits. In this study, we first tested the
   suitability of association tests for assessing female mate preferences
   in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Sand goby females showed
   sexually motivated association preferences that were repeatable and
   corresponded to actual mating decisions. We then compared the
   correlation between the preferences of two different females presented
   to the same male pair with the correlation between preferences of single
   females tested twice. We found a weak correlation between preferences in
   the two-female treatment, while the correspondence between preferences
   was much higher for the single-female treatment. These results are in
   accordance with the possibility that sand goby females show genetically
   based, individual differences in mate preferences. (C) 2007 The

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies are focusing on the role of animal
   temperament in the ecology of wild populations. One important step in
   these studies is to estimate the repeatability of temperament traits, by
   replicating measures of an animal's behavioural or physiological
   reactions to a novel or stressful situation. When studies are performed
   in the field, several factors can affect repeatability estimates: (1)
   micro-environmental conditions prior to or during a test may affect the
   measured behaviour, and spatial heterogeneity in predation risk within
   the habitat of a population may affect repeatability; (2) a decrease
   over time in the strength of behavioural reactions as a result of
   habituation may bias repeatability; and (3) individuals may differ in
   their habituation. In this study we used a linear mixed-model approach
   to test for the occurrence of interindividual variation in behavioural
   reaction and habituation of eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, to a
   hole-board test and a handling bag test. We found high intraindividual
   consistency for the behaviours recorded both in the hole-board and
   handling bag tests; four temperament traits could be considered (i.e.
   activity/exploration, reaction to stress, emotionality and docility).
   Given that we found no phenotypic variation in habituation, chipmunks
   seem to show a behavioural carryover in activity/exploration and
   docility, which could have consequences for the evolutionary potential
   of habituation to novelty. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{In this study, we repeatedly observed individually marked Brook Trout in
   a field setting to determine if the bimodal variation in foraging
   tactics previously observed in young salmonid populations (without
   distinct morphological differences) is generated by individuals
   specializing at different foraging tactics. We found significant but low
   repeatability in several foraging movement parameters. This indicated
   that while individuals did have tendencies to be sedentary versus highly
   active, there was considerable variation in foraging activity within
   individuals. These results suggest that relatively consistent
   differences among individuals may facilitate selection for specialized
   morphology and that there may be a heritable component to activity.}},
