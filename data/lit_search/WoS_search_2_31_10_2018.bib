Volume = {{150}},

Pages = {{1491-1508}},
Abstract = {{Postmating sexual selection plays an important part in the evolution of
   secondary sexual characters. Based on differential allocation theory
   that predicts biased reproductive investment of females depending on the
   attractiveness of mates, a number of previous studies have shown that
   egg production is related in various ways to ornamental sexual traits of
   males, but evidence for behavioural sexual traits is less abundant. In
   this study we examine such maternal effects in relation to birdsong.
   Because the Bengalese finch is a monomorphic songbird, courtship song
   serves a key role in mate choice. To take into account individual female
   differences in egg production performance, we sequentially paired naive,
   captive, female Bengalese finches to two different males, and
   investigated if their reproductive investment (clutch size, egg mass and
   hatchling sex ratio) was related to the song traits of their mates. We
   found that clutch size and egg mass were highly repeatable within
   individual females while sex ratio was not. Despite the inflexibility of
   egg mass within each female, egg mass increased when females were mated
   to males with longer songs. In addition, we found a non-significant weak
   tendency toward male-biased sex ratio in relation to longer song
   duration of mates. Our findings suggest that females mated to better
   mates adjusted their reproductive investment by producing heavier eggs
   and possibly offspring of the more costly sex.}},

Abstract = {{Observations were collected for the purpose of comparing exit velocity
   measurements in the form of exit score (ES; walk, trot, canter, or run)
   and flight speed (FS) as assessments of cattle temperament. Squeeze
   chute exit velocity was obtained for 1,181 crossbred yearling steers
   using ES and FS temperament systems. Flight speed used infrared sensors
   to determine the time taken for an animal to traverse a fixed distance
   of 1.83 m after exiting the squeeze chute. Exit score (1 = walk, 2 =
   trot, 3 = canter, and 4 = run) was assigned by 2 different observers
   when each steer crossed a fixed point between the infrared sensors. All
   animals were scored with each system (ES and FS) simultaneously on
   exiting the squeeze chute on d -21 and d -1 of the experiment. Of the
   1,181 cattle, 357 were moved to a nearby research feedyard for use in a
   140 d feedlot trial. These cattle were scored using both measurement
   systems and BW was recorded at 35 d intervals throughout the trial. Exit
   score was assessed for observer reliability, ES and FS were compared for
   measurement repeat-ability, and both were assessed on ability to predict
   ADG. Exit score between observers on a single day showed considerable
   agreement (weighted Kappa = 0.66), indicating the system was reliable
   between different observers. However, the agreement for a single
   observer between day was only moderate (weighted Kappa = 0.40),
   indicating a day effect for ES. In addition, although mean velocities
   for day were not different (P > 0.18; FS = 2.98 +/- .87 and 3.02 +/-
   0.87 m/s for day, respectively), the persistence of FS for each animal
   was low (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.25). The frequency
   that an animal would be placed into the same third of FS or receive the
   same ES on consecutive weigh days was 50\% and 60.0\%, respectively, and
   both were moderate predictors of ADG (R-2 = 0.14 and R-2 = 0.17). These
   data indicate that ES and FS are reliable instruments for assessment of
   temperament on a given day, and show moderate repeatability across days.
   Exit score and FS show similar ability to predict ADG and can be used
   interchangeably as measures of temperament.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{799-811}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that repeated assays of behaviour, conducted
   both within and across situations, could reveal important insights into
   two traditionally distinct areas of study: animal personality and
   individual differences in behavioural plasticity. However, at present
   relatively few studies present such data, and few consider how changing
   abiotic conditions affect behavioural plasticity. Individual differences
   in metabolic rate have been suggested as a proximate mechanism promoting
   personality, leading one to speculate that individual differences in
   metabolic sensitivity to temperature may affect behavioural responses in
   ectotherms. At present, only one study (out of two) has tested for and
   shown individual differences in behavioural responses to temperature.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed the behaviour of a marine crab across a
   narrow range of temperatures to test for individual differences in
   responses to temperature. We observed large inter-individual differences
   in behaviour that were consistent over time at a given temperature
   (evidence for personality), and individual differences in responses to
   temperature (evidence for plasticity). This study adds to the very scant
   literature on ectotherm behavioural sensitivity to temperature, and
   suggests the phenomenon might be widespread. We speculate about the role
   of metabolism as a proximate mechanism that might explain these
   individual differences in plasticity and make suggestions for future
   research to test this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal sensitivity in cats has historically been assessed using complex
   devices which require direct application to the patient and can
   therefore, in themselves, affect the measurement. This study aimed to
   validate the use of a remote low power (165 mW) carbon dioxide laser
   device for the assessment of thermal nociceptive thresholds in cats.
   Repeatabilites were established based on individual responses to three
   thermal tests on the same day and across 4 consecutive days. A total of
   12 thermal tests were conducted on each of eight male and eight female
   de-sexed adult cats. As a control a non-thermal helium aiming laser was
   used to ensure the animals were responding to the thermal component of
   the device. All thermal tests elicited a behavioural response with the
   large majority being a skin twitch known as the panniculus reflex
   (97\%). None of the non-thermal tests resulted in this reflex behaviour.
   There was no evidence that cats became sensitised or habituated to the
   low power thermal stimulus on any given day (P=0.426) or across days
   (P=0.115), or that there was any interaction between the two time
   factors (P=0.084). There was also no difference in latency to respond
   between males and females (P=0.094), although there was a significant
   interaction between the day of testing and the sex of the subject
   (P=0.042). Significant intra-class correlations demonstrated that
   individual responses were repeatable over days 1-3 (all P<0.05) but not
   over day 4 (P=0.096). A significant intra-class correlation was also
   evident across all days when data were combined (P<0.0001). This
   technique shows some promise in assessing individual nociceptive
   thresholds and as a tool to establish associated individual differences.
   It could, with more exploration, also provide an alternative thermal
   mechanism for testing the efficacy of analgesics in cats. The
   significant repeatabilities were low ranging from 0.241 to 0.414, this
   suggests that a number of extraneous factors may have influenced
   responses to CO2 laser stimulation at low power levels (165 mW). Further
   exploration of this technique on a larger sample than used here may
   allow elucidation of any other factors, including age or sex effects,
   that impact upon thermal sensitivity in the domestic cat. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Background: Sedentary behavior (SB), independent of physical activity,
   represents a significant health risk. We previously used objective
   measures to demonstrate that bariatric surgery candidates engage in high
   levels of SB overall, but supplementing these measures with subjective
   reports would provide information about time allocated to different
   forms of SB. The aim of this study was to examine self-reported time
   spent performing specific types of SB and discrepancy between
   self-reported and objectively measured estimates of total sedentary time
   in bariatric surgery candidates.
   Methods: A total of 52 bariatric surgery candidates (87\% female; age =
   46.2 +/- 9.1 years; body mass index {[}BMI] = 45.3 +/- 6.7) completed
   the 9-item Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) as a subjective
   measure of SB and wore the SenseWear Armband (SWA; SenseWear,
   Pittsburgh, PA) as an objective measure. Paired samples t tests and the
   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) assessed measurement
   discrepancy.
   Results: Television-viewing was the most frequently performed type of SB
   (2.7 +/- 1.6 hours per day), followed by paper/computer work (1.9 +/-
   1.8 hours per day), driving/riding in automobile (1.2 +/- 1.1 hours per
   day), and sitting/talking on telephone (1.1 +/- 1.2 hours per day). On
   average, the SBQ and SWA produced similar estimates of daily sedentary
   time (hours per day) at the group level (9.6 +/- 4.8 versus 9.3 +/- 1.9;
   mean difference = -.34 +/- 4.6; P = .59), although agreement between the
   measures at the individual level was poor (mean absolute value of
   difference = 3.8 +/- 2.8 hours per day; ICC = .22; P = .06).
   Conclusion: Television-viewing was the single SB in which participants
   most frequently engaged and thus may be an important modifiable target
   for reducing total sedentary time in bariatric surgery candidates. The
   SBQ and SWA can be used similarly to describe SB levels in this patient
   population at the group level; however, ability of these measures to
   produce comparable estimates of sedentary time for any individual
   patient is limited. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2013;9:123-128.) (C) 2013

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Baby Pediatric Symptom Checklist
   (BPSC), a brief social/emotional screening instrument for children less
   than 18 months. The BPSC is modeled after the Pediatric Symptom
   Checklist (PSC) and is part of the Survey of Wellbeing of Young
   Children, a comprehensive, freely available screening instrument
   designed for use in pediatric primary care.
   METHOD: BPSC items were developed by a team of experts who reviewed
   existing assessment instruments and relevant research literature. Scale
   construction and initial validation were conducted with 205 families
   from pediatric primary care sites and 54 families from referral clinics.
   A replication sample of 146 additional families were enrolled from an
   independent set of primary care practices.
   RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed 3 dimensions of the BPSC:
   irritability, inflexibility, and difficulty with routines. Factor
   structure was confirmed in the replication sample. Retest reliability
   and internal reliability were adequate (intraclass correlation
   coefficient >0.70) across subscales, with the exception of the
   ``irritability{''} subscale's internal reliability in the replication
   sample. Construct validity of the ``irritability{''} and the
   ``difficulty with routines{''} subscales is supported by correlations
   with the Parenting Stress Index and the Ages \& Stages Questionnaire:
   Social/Emotional, but the ``inflexibility{''} subscale seems to be
   distinct from performance on these instruments. Tests of differential
   item functioning revealed no significant effects for race/ethnicity,
   child gender, parent education, or family income. Age-based normative
   data were calculated for each subscale.
   CONCLUSION: The BPSC assesses 3 domains of behavior for very young
   children and shows promise as a social/emotional screening instrument
   for pediatric primary care.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, animal social interactions have received much attention
   in terms of personality research (e.g. aggressive or cooperative
   interactions). However, other components of social behaviour such as
   those describing the intensity, frequency, directedness and individual
   repeatability of interactions in animal groups have largely been
   neglected. Network analysis offers a valuable opportunity to
   characterize individual consistency of traits in labile social groups
   and therein provide novel insights to personality research in ways

   network positions be consistently different between individuals under
   changing conditions, they might reflect expressions of an individual's
   personality. Here, we discuss a conceptual framework for using network
   analyses to infer the presence of individual differences and present a
   statistical test based on randomization techniques for testing the
   consistency of network positions in individuals. The statistical tools
   presented are useful because if particular individuals consistently
   occupy key positions in social networks, then this is also likely to
   have consequences for their fitness as well as for that of others in the

   individual network position has been shown to be important for the

Abstract = {{Evolutionary mechanisms leading to correlations across different
   behaviours, called behavioural syndromes, are hard to study, mostly
   because behavioural syndromes are group/population level phenomena.
   Recently (Herczeg and Garamszegi Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66:161-169, 2012),
   we introduced the concept of syndrome deviation that allows the study of
   behavioural syndromes at the individual level by focusing on the
   individual deviation from the hypothetical perfect group-level
   behavioural correlation. Subsequently, Dingemanse et al. (Behav Ecol
   Sociobiol 66:1543-1548, 2012) emphasized that behavioural syndromes
   refer to the between-individual component of phenotypic correlations,
   and only this component is relevant for syndrome deviation. They also
   recommended mixed models to decompose the between- and within-individual
   correlations. We agree that separating these components is important,
   but the proposed approach is impractical to apply for functionally
   different behaviours because (1) the assumption of constant
   within-individual correlations is unjustified and (2) different
   behaviours cannot be measured at the same time. Further, our simulations
   based on mixed models show that the statistical differentiation between
   the within- and between-individual components is inefficient when using
   realistic sample sizes. Until the separation of between- and
   within-individual correlations is resolved, we recommend alternative
   approaches for empirical behavioural syndrome research that consider the
   repeatability of the behaviours and the optimal balance between within-
   and between-individual sample sizes. Syndrome deviation calculated from
   phenotypic correlations of traits that are proven to be individual
   specific, or from the between-individual correlations if possible, is a
   meaningful metric to describe behavioural consistency and to explain its
   evolutionary significance.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, indicative of
   behavioural types or personalities, have been shown in taxa ranging from
   Cnidaria to Mammalia. However, despite numerous theoretical explanations
   there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that
   maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined
   behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the
   North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a
   remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to
   females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested
   twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual
   pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of
   undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics
   or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour.
   However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking
   rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the
   auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to
   which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to
   disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from
   proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive
   females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test.
   Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater
   among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of
   more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the
   long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by
   other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a
   mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity,
   physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup
   activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
   variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal
   environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment
   matching.}},

Abstract = {{During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the
   energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource
   depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between
   individuals of different personality types. We tested whether
   individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus,
   forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking
   behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel
   object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment,
   we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites.
   During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to
   exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel
   object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these
   individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively
   indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start
   feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to
   nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk
   taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk.
   Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing
   field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between
   individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness
   measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a
   foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this
   personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual
   differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of
   variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using
   optimality approaches. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

   effect of body weight and the interaction between piglet weight and
   behaviour were also tested. Piglet was entered into the model as a
   random effect as an additional test of repeatability. The effect of
   repeated testing was used to test the stability of measures. Pearson
   correlations between repeated measures were used to test the
   repeatability of measures. Variance component analysis was used to
   describe the variability in the data. Results Variance component
   analysis indicated that piglet explained only 17\% of the variance in
   the data. All variables in the model (behaviour prior to testing, sex,
   week, day within week, repetition within day, body weight, the
   interaction between body weight and behaviour, piglet identity) except
   sex had a significant effect (p < 0.04 for all). Correlations between
   repeated measures increased from the first to the second week.
   Conclusions and Clinical relevance Repeatability was acceptable only
   during the second week of testing and measures changed with repeated
   testing and increased with increasing piglet weight, indicating that
   time (age) and animal body weight should be taken into account when
   measuring mechanical (nociceptive) thresholds in piglets. Mechanical
   (nociceptive) thresholds can be used both for testing the efficacy of
   anaesthetics and analgesics, and for assessing hyperalgesia in chronic
   pain states in research and clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the
   life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to
   travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in
   dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g.
   specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar
   reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive
   abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl
   is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many
   physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress
   response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is
   also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site
   to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one
   breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set.
   Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during
   natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering
   experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents
   had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by
   parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and
   breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating
   that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled
   in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might
   be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to
   explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration
   and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but
   the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly
   understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones
   (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards
   predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future
   fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress
   physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated
   flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria
   mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone
   concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body
   condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether
   stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either
   independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether
   incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females,
   would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for
   individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and
   females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations
   generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by
   interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High
   stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger
   females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females.
   Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less
   strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy
   females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter
   incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness,
   helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival.
   However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood
   in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{There is much interest in studying animal personalities but considerable
   debate as to how to define and evaluate them. We assessed the utility of
   one proposed framework while studying personality in terrestrial hermit
   crabs (Coenobita clypeatus). We recorded the latency of individuals to
   emerge from their shells over multiple trials in four unique
   manipulations. We used the specific testing situations within these
   manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral
   consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same
   situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations
   between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs
   had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between
   behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these
   correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component
   analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors
   and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured
   behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general
   personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention
   must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods,
   and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

Abstract = {{1. One of the main drivers of the genesis and maintenance of
   biodiversity is mobility, i.e. the net result of the interaction between
   physiological performances (movement capacity) and behavioural decisions
   (movement decisions). Although several previous studies have found
   personality traits related to mobility, it is not yet clear whether
   mobility involves a real syndrome, i.e. whether individuals showing good
   movement capacity are also more likely to decide to move, and whether
   these inter-individual differences are consistent across time. 2. The
   aim of the present study was therefore to disentangle the mechanisms
   underlying the maintenance of inter-individual variation in mobility by
   measuring three traits related to mobility under experimental conditions
   in a butterfly species, and to test the existence of correlations
   between these traits. These measures implied movement capacity and
   movement decision. 3. It was shown that mobility-related traits were (i)
   consistent across time, (ii) inter-correlated, and (iii) dependent upon
   sex and morphology. 4. These results therefore suggest the existence of
   a mobility syndrome in a butterfly. Such findings highlight the
   necessity to accurately integrate inter-individual variation

   traits exploratory tendencies and struggling rate using captive female
   zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental
   sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up
   to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that,
   overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly
   repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were

   Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both

Abstract = {{In evolutionary and behavioural ecology, increasing attention is being
   paid to the fact that functionally distinct behaviours are often not
   independent from each other. Such phenomenon is labelled as behavioural
   syndrome and is usually demonstrated by phenotypic correlations between
   behaviours like activity, exploration, aggression and risk-taking across
   individuals in a population. However, published studies disagree on the
   strength, and even on the existence of such relationships. To make
   general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed
   the literature using modern meta-analytic approaches. Based on a large
   dataset, we investigated the overall relationship between behaviours
   that are expected to form a syndrome and tested which factors can
   mediate heterogeneities in study outcomes. The average strength of the
   phenotypic correlation between behaviours was weak; we found no effect
   of the phylogeny of species but did observe significant publication
   bias. However, even accounting for this bias, the mean effect size was
   positive and statistically different from zero (r = 0.198). Effect sizes
   showed considerable heterogeneity within species, implying a role for
   population-specific adaptation to environmental factors and/or
   between-study differences in research design. There was a significant
   positive association between absolute effect size and repeatability of
   behaviours, suggesting that within-individual variation of behavioural
   traits can set up an upper limit for the strength of the detected
   phenotypic correlations. Moreover, spatial overlap between the contexts
   in which different behaviours were assayed increased the magnitude of
   the association. The small effect size for the focal relationship
   implies that a huge sample size would be required to demonstrate a
   correlation between behaviours with sufficient statistical power, which
   is fulfilled only in very few studies. This suggests that behavioural
   syndromes often remain undetected and unpublished. Collectively, our
   meta-analysis revealed a number of points that might be worth to
   consider in the future study of behavioural syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual behavioral differences across ecological contexts
   are a recognized feature of animal populations. These differences can be
   expressed in two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The
   former is characterized by consistent responses in one context (i.e.
   repeatability), whereas the latter by consistency that spans contexts
   (i.e. behavioral syndromes). The proximate causes of behavioral
   consistency remain unclear, yet there is evidence that physiology may
   couple the expression of some behavioral traits in unrelated contexts.
   We therefore explored the correlation between bold behavior of female
   sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and the condition of the
   hepatopancreas, an organ vital to crustacean metabolism and
   reproduction. We did this by taking replicate measurements of two
   risk-taking behaviors per individual in the contexts of predator
   avoidance and environment exploration, and examining correlations within
   and between these observations. We then determined the relationship of
   behavior with hepatopancreas mass and lipid content. Individual crabs
   responded consistently within each context. However, across-context
   correlations were absent, indicating that boldness is isolated, at least
   in the selected scenarios. Additionally, anti-predator and exploratory
   behaviors were significantly influenced by size but not linked to
   hepatopancreas physiology. Our results show that context-specific trait

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic comparative studies rely on species-specific data that
   often contain missing values and/or differ in sample size among species.
   These phenomena may violate statistical assumptions about the non-random
   variance component in sampling effort. A major reason why this
   assumption is often not fulfilled is because the probability of being
   sampled (i.e., being captured or observed) may depend on
   species-specific characteristics. Here, we test this assumption by using
   information on within-species sample sizes and missing data from five
   independent comparative datasets of European birds. First, we show that
   the two estimates of data availability (missing values and
   within-species sample size) are positively correlated and are associated
   with research effort in general (the number of papers published).
   Second, we demonstrate biologically meaningful relationships between
   data availability and phenotypic traits. For example, population size,
   risk-taking, and habitat specialization independently predicted
   within-species sample size. The key determinants of missing data were
   population size and distribution range. However, data availability was
   not structured by phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate
   that the accuracy of sampling is repeatable and distributed non-randomly
   among species, as several species-specific attributes determined the
   probability of observation. Therefore, data availability seems to be a

Abstract = {{The detrimental effects of steroid-mimics are well known but
   investigations on non-steroid pharmaceuticals are less common. In
   addition, most behavioral studies do not examine the effects at multiple
   time points. This study examined the effects of fluoxetine, a selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on behavior when male Siamese fighting
   fish encounter female and male dummy conspecifics simultaneously. Thus,
   how chemical exposure impacts behavioral consistency and whether
   individuals differ in their sensitivity to exposure was assessed.
   Overall aggression was reduced after fluoxetine administration while
   courtship was unaffected. Fluoxetine affected behavioral consistency
   towards both the male and female, with individuals behaving less
   consistently to the male and more consistently to the female. In
   addition, males appeared to differ in their sensitivity to fluoxetine
   exposure as not all males reduced their aggression after administration.
   This has important implications for studying the effects of unintended
   pharmaceutical exposure. Exposure may have evolutionary implications as
   it may influence both territorial defense and mating success. In sum,
   these findings demonstrate that pharmaceutical exposure may alter more
   than just overall level of behavior and stress the importance of
   examining the effects of exposure on an individual level. (C) 2012

   reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community
   analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation

   identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found

Abstract = {{Harvesting wild populations may contrast or reinforce natural agents of
   selection and potentially cause evolutionary changes in life-history
   traits such as growth and maturation. Harvest selection may also act on
   behavioral traits, although this field of research has so far received
   less attention. We used acoustic tags and a network of receivers to
   monitor the behavior and fate of individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua,
   N = 60) in their natural habitat on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Fish
   with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow-and
   deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery
   (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper
   water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish
   size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration. Natural
   selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a
   large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant
   repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual
   characteristics tended to persist and therefore may be termed
   personality traits. We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries
   management should consider fish behavior. This would be of particular
   relevance for spatial management actions such as marine reserve design.}},

Abstract = {{Current scores for equine personality traits assessed during performance
   tests are characterised by high means and inadequate variation,
   hampering genetic selection for these traits. A number of temperament
   and related behaviour tests have been developed in order to make
   assessment of equine personality more objective. However, rarely these
   tests have been validated for their use as a selection tool. Thus, as a
   first step the aim of the present study was to integrate a temperament
   tests into horse performance tests, in order to assess variability and
   repeatability of horses' reactivity under the rider and the reliability
   of the judges' assessment thereof. The temperament test was comprised of
   three novel stimuli, including a visual stimulus (BALL), a visual and
   tactile stimulus (GATE), and a visual and auditory stimulus (CANS). A
   total of 224 mares and stallions were subjected to the test during their
   participation in station performance tests for riding horses, and 133 of
   these horses were subjected to the test a second time either 2-3 weeks
   or 18 weeks after the first test. Horses were ridden in the test by
   professional riders, and their reactions to the stimuli were evaluated
   each by two judges and the rider using scores on a scale from 1 (task
   not concluded) to 10 (completely calm but attentive horse). Mean scores
   (+/- SD) ranged between 6.6 +/- 2.4 (GATE) and 7.8 +/- 2.1 (BALL),
   demonstrating lower means and considerably higher standard deviations
   than the same horses' scores from present evaluation of the trait
   labelled temperament (8.1 +/- 0.9) or related personality traits (e.g.
   character: 8.3 +/- 0.8). Using variance components from mixed model
   analysis, inter-observer agreement between the two judges was for the
   individual stimuli very high (0.95 (BALL), 0.96 (GATE), 0.89 (CANS)),
   and there was likewise high agreement between the judges' and the riders
   combined scores (0.93). Repeatabilities of horses' scores were 0.72
   (BALL), 0.75 (GATE), and 0.69 (CANS). Correlations to traits from the
   present evaluation of personality were low or non-existent, indicating
   that these traits are not a reflection of anxiety or fear reactivity as
   assessed by novel object tests. Horses' improvement in judges' combined
   scores from first to second test was not (P > 0.1) influenced by
   differences in time between tests, but differed between breed-types and
   individual riders. Also, not surprisingly, the higher horses' scores in
   the first test were, the lower their improvement in the second test was
   (-0.45 +/- 0.06 per additional score in the first test). Temperament
   tests using novel stimuli presented to horses under a rider may be a
   practical and valid tool for improving the current assessment of equine
   personality traits during performance tests. Considering a combination
   of absolute scores and horses' improvement in scores of repeated tests,
   rather than measuring only absolute scores yields relevant information
   about horses' personality, and at the same time it may prevent owners
   from deliberately training their horses for low reactions to the
   test-stimuli. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, using a personality approach for studies of animal
   behaviour has increased our ability to predict an individual's or
   population's behavioural responses to external stimuli. At a population
   level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and
   the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across
   different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a
   predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced
   changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural
   type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether
   exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness.
   We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally
   different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or
   contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural
   antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing
   (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types
   expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e.
   shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However,
   an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in
   either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses
   were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that
   individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased
   predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and
   that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{Remarkable diversity in behaviour and morphology (phenotypes) are often
   observed within a species; this diversity can be understood in terms of
   individuals maximizing their fitness. Based on evidence from studies
   linking different phenotypes to individual behaviours we hypothesize
   that discrete colour polymorphism can reflect personality. We tested for
   such a relationship in a social bird, the Gouldian finch, which shows
   two major head-colour morphs: red and black. Forty birds of differing
   head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found
   that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird
   performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour.
   Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than
   pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and
   touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder);
   (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the
   presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4)
   boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole
   sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed
   birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that
   colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural
   differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect
   this to function as a signal in competitive and cooperative (social)

Volume = {{84}},

Pages = {{197-204}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Behaviour is generally plastic to some degree and allows an animal to
   react appropriately to changing and novel conditions. Consequently, a
   degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an
   organism's ability to cope with novel (e. g. urban) environments. Yet
   behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals
   exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in
   behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus
   personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs
   in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The
   spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated
   between-and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability
   for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and
   voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high
   individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of
   individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency
   and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness,
   whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not
   heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual
   variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours
   related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may
   be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes
   success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether
   composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and
   survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had
   highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not
   significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in
   high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean
   aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive
   personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would
   be a possible scenario. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The construct of alexithymia as a vulnerability factor for substance use

   follow-up of a 3-month trial of inpatient Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
   (CBT) with or without a Shared Decision Making intervention for 187 SUB

   models were used to evaluate the relation between covariates and change

Abstract = {{When an individual is repeatedly observed or tested in the same context,
   it does not always express the same behaviour. Intraindividual
   variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible
   variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although
   individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this
   topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals.
   Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in
   important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior
   experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to
   differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently
   used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the
   assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using `boldness'
   data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish,
   Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour
   systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result
   of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data
   on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in
   behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual
   differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much
   more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by
   discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to
   interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications
   of our findings for methods currently used to study individual
   differences in behaviour in animals. (c) 2012 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Individuals are regularly documented to consistently differ in their

   personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with

   non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression

   most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious
   species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential
   hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic
   genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary
   male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach
   allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst
   controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both
   secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual
   level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT
   scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and
   were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic
   control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than
   hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to
   sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with
   bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was
   not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is often assumed to be the most flexible of traits, yet
   recent studies show a high repeatability of behaviour within individuals
   even across different functional contexts. Such consistent expression of
   behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with
   less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects
   produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal
   timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying
   correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the
   evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which
   pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct
   behaviours. 2. Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind
   aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds,
   Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of
   aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens
   on aggression and mating behaviour. 3. We found that androgen
   concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and
   interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation
   in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects
   of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences
   among individuals in aggression. 4. These findings suggest that
   decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an
   important step in the evolution of personality traits.}},

   significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but
   mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual

   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Animals attacked by predators often enter a state of tonic immobility
   (TI) in which individuals appear to simulate death. Despite the fact
   that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals,
   quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild
   vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for
   the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we
   tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2
   components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the
   Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer
   montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in
   boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator
   models) or is simply related to variation in general
   activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We
   analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling
   (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to
   analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively
   high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures
   of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast,
   our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate
   can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI
   a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving
   personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition,
   we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to
   analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other
   approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more
   widely used.}},

   Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) during experimental field trials.
   Sampling behavior of individual jays was moderately repeatable within

   birds' willingness to approach a novel object and take food in front of
   a predator mount. These results suggest that food sampling is a
   measurable component in the suite of traits comprising the Steller's jay
   behavioral syndrome. Model selection techniques indicated that sampling
   behavior was more common in older, neophilic, risk-prone, larger jays,

   Yet, genetic and non-genetic factors are often deeply intertwined, and

   swift (Apus melba) by making use of long-term behavioural observations
   on parents and cross-fostered offspring. By applying an `animal model'
   approach to observational data, we show that antipredator behaviour of
   adult Alpine swifts was significantly repeatable over lifetime (r =
   0.273) and heritable (h(2) = 0.146). Regression models also show that
   antipredator behaviours differed between colonies and sexes (females
   were more tame), and varied with the hour and year of capture. By
   applying a parent-offspring regression approach to 59 offspring that
   were exchanged as eggs or hatchlings between pairs of nests, we
   demonstrate that offspring behaved like their biological parents rather
   than like their foster parents when they were adults themselves. Those
   findings provide strong evidence that antipredator behaviour of adult
   Alpine swifts is shaped by genetics and/or pre-hatching maternal effects

Pages = {{351-359}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior suggest that individuals
   respond in a predictable and repeatable manner in a specific situation
   while differing from other individuals. Male Siamese fighting fish
   exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies
   when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously.
   However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is
   unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on
   behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with
   paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain
   a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive
   contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies
   after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive
   behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of
   female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an
   increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that
   only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before
   encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the
   dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited
   similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced
   with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while
   winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not
   influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that
   consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be
   resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days.}},

Abstract = {{1. According to a recent hypothesis, personality traits should form
   integrative pace-of-life syndromes with life-history traits. Potential
   life-history traits that explain personality variation are immune
   defence and growth rate.
   2. We studied whether boldness, measured as hiding behaviour, is
   repeatable during ontogeny in the field cricket, Gryllus integer, and if
   it relates to the efficiency of immune function (i. e. the capacity to
   encapsulate a nylon implant), growth rate, developmental time and size
   as an adult.
   3. Hiding behaviour was rank-order repeatable, and in general, juveniles
   were bolder than adults. Individuals that were cautious at early
   juvenile stages had higher encapsulation responses late in life compared
   with bold individuals. Most clearly, fast-growing individuals matured
   early and invested little in immune defence compared with their
   slower-growing conspecifics, i. e. showed patterns of a ` grow fast, die
   young' life-history strategy.
   4. Our results may arise from a trade-off between immunity-dependent
   survival and bold behaviour. Trade-offs between investment in survival
   and behaviour could account for the maintenance of variation in
   personality traits by favouring certain combinations of behavioural and
   life-history strategies (i. e. pace-of-life-syndromes).}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive
   evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in
   behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For
   instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality
   evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that
   vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher
   exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to
   higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which
   proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on
   foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any
   motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged
   this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or
   combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have
   additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the
   Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\%
   and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to
   feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency
   to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and
   positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and
   individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a
   period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction
   between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect
   of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the
   relevance of our results in relation to the different factors
   influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a
   life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of
   life-history traits and personality.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with
   animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that
   studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may
   not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some
   individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between
   boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the
   Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed
   in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between
   nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness
   consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by
   factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated
   to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity
   (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold
   individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had
   higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation
   model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and
   reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits
   (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals
   for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently
   underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the
   populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either
   develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for
   obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum
   bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. (C) 2012 The

   population of great tits (Parus major) to explore whether individual
   differences in competitive ability when foraging can be explained by two
   traits that have previously been linked to alternative behavioural
   strategies: the personality trait `exploration behaviour' and a simple
   cognitive trait, `innovative problem-solving performance'. We assayed
   these traits under standardized conditions in captivity and then
   measured competitive ability at feeders with restricted access in the
   wild. Competitive ability was repeatable within individual males across
   days and correlated positively with exploration behaviour, representing
   the first such demonstration of a link between a personality trait and
   both competitive ability and food intake in the wild. Competitive
   ability was also simultaneously negatively correlated with
   problem-solving performance; individuals who were poor competitors were
   good at problem-solving. Rather than being the result of variation in
   `individual quality', our results support the hypothesis that individual

Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,

Abstract = {{The glucocorticoid (GC) stress response is thought to be an individual
   trait associated with behaviour and life history strategies. Studies
   exploring such relationships typically assume measured hormone values to
   be repeatable within an individual. However, repeatability of GCs has
   proven variable in wild animals and underlying reasons remain unknown.
   We assessed individual repeatability of circulating stress-induced
   cortisol. the primary GC in teleost fish, and glucose concentrations in
   a wild teleost fish held under consistent laboratory conditions. We also
   tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of intra-individual variability
   in stress-induced cortisol concentrations ({''}cortisol variability{''})
   is influenced by body condition. Wild-caught bluegill sunfish (Lepomis
   macrochirus) were subjected to repeated standardized stressors and blood
   sampled (3 times over 6 days) once cortisol concentrations peaked.
   Various indicators of fish condition, both whole body and physiological,
   were also measured. Overall, stress-induced circulating cortisol
   concentrations were repeatable but stress-induced glucose was not.
   Cortisol variability was related to Fulton's condition factor and size
   (eviscerated mass) where smaller fish in poor condition exhibited
   increased cortisol variability. The findings have implications for the
   interpretation of studies that examine correlates of GC concentrations
   as they suggest consistency in stress responsiveness is influenced by
   factors such as size and condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in boldness have been identified in
   many species and can have important effects on fitness. In most animals,
   juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than
   do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and
   environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the
   boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets,
   adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling
   increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness
   (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets.
   Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We
   found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but
   not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we
   predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also
   found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that
   individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when
   they were nymphs, versus when they were adults.}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency,
   linking behavioural variation to individual differences in other
   phenotypic features. Empirical studies are, however, rare. Here, we
   tested for a size and growth-dependent stable behavioural syndrome in
   the juvenile-stages of a solitary apex predator ( pike, Esox lucius),
   shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming
   activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful
   prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact
   with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was
   considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary
   predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat
   avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural
   syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour
   between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation.
   However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in
   conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the
   state-dependent personality hypothesis. The importance of a combination
   of spatial and temporal environmental variation for generating growth
   differences is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown repeatable individual variability in
   temperament traits. We tested the hypotheses that individual Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) vary consistently in their response to
   predators, a temperament trait, and that this individual variation is
   associated with breeding-site selection. Specifically, we tested whether
   measures of behavioral response to human approaches are associated with
   either patch area or patch openness and thus to area sensitivity. We
   made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010,
   measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the
   distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the
   data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling.
   Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was
   controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance
   and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong
   effect of area or openness on either flight-initiation distance or
   distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to
   predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not
   explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches. Because
   flight-initiation distance is often used to identify distances at which
   human behavior disrupts wildlife, we estimate its mean (21.8 m) and the
   distance at which 75\%, 95\%, and 99\% of the Bobolinks flushed (28, 40,
   and 59 m, respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Although increasing attention is given to both the causes and
   consequences of variation in animal personality, the measurement of
   personality in captive or free-ranging individuals remains an issue. In
   particular, one important question concerns whether personality should
   be established from the existence of complex behavioral syndromes (a
   suite of correlated behavioral traits) or could be more easily deduced
   from a single variable. In that context, it has recently been suggested
   that handling stress, measured through breathing rate during handling,
   could be a good descriptor of personality, at least in passerine birds.
   The authors experimentally investigated to what extent handling stress
   was correlated with personality in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata), as assessed from a suite of repeatable behavioral traits,
   including activity, exploratory behavior, neophobia, and reaction to
   startle. Although breathing rate was repeatable across individuals, it
   was not related to any behavioral trait, suggesting that it cannot be
   used to quickly predict personality, at least in zebra finches.
   Breathing rate during handling, in addition, was related to morphology,
   questioning the fact that breathing rate during handling reflects
   personality irrespective of individual state. The authors suggest that
   inference on global personality from a reduced number of traits should
   be performed with caution.}},

Pages = {{601-622}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming clear that individual animals exhibit behaviours that are
   repeatable, consistent and predictable across various contexts and time,
   and that may be correlated to form behavioural syndromes. The influence
   of parasitism on host behaviour, although well-documented, is only now
   being examined in a multi-trait context, and behavioural syndromes
   provide a framework for such investigations. We test the hypothesis that
   parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the
   relationship between infection by four trematode species and the
   correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours
   (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus
   cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a
   significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these
   behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator
   cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were
   significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon
   sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test
   sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue.
   Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression
   was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis,
   Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the
   association depending on the behaviour tested. These findings suggest
   that behavioural syndromes may not only be targets for adaptive host
   manipulation by parasites, but also that, even if through mere

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits may play a role in
   reproductive behaviour and it is likely that different personality types
   have different reproductive success across specific social environments.
   This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types,
   including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive
   tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders
   (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing
   the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of
   personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto
   been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences
   in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a
   small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We
   predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males
   that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of
   behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural
   syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual
   male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm
   competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials.
   Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with
   the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression
   and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard
   a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant
   association between the tendency to guard and morphological and
   physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding
   tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating
   tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the
   product of prevailing environmental and social conditions.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in typical whole-animal dependent variables following drug
   administration represent an integral of the drug's pharmacological
   effect, the individual's autonomic and behavioral responses to the
   resulting disturbance, and many other influences. An archetypical
   example is core temperature (T-c), long used for quantifying initial
   drug sensitivity and tolerance acquisition over repeated drug
   administrations. Our previous work suggested that rats differing in
   initial sensitivity to nitrous oxide (N2O)-induced hypothermia would
   exhibit different patterns of tolerance development across N2O
   administrations. Specifically, we hypothesized that rats with an
   initially insensitive phenotype would subsequently develop regulatory
   overcompensation that would mediate an allostatic hyperthermic state,
   whereas rats with an initially sensitive phenotype would subsequently
   compensate to a homeostatic normothermic state. To preclude confounding
   due to handling and invasive procedures, a valid test of this prediction
   required non-invasive thermal measurements via implanted telemetric
   temperature sensors, combined direct and indirect calorimetry, and
   automated drug delivery to enable repeatable steady-state dosing. We
   screened 237 adult rats for initial sensitivity to 70\% N2O-induced
   hypothermia. Thirty highly sensitive rats that exhibited marked
   hypothermia when screened and 30 highly insensitive rats that initially
   exhibited minimal hypothermia were randomized to three groups (n=10
   each/group) that received: (1) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\% N2O using
   a classical conditioning procedure, (2) twelve 90-min exposures to 70\%
   N2O using a random control procedure for conditioning, or (3) a no-drug
   control group that received custom-made air. Metabolic heat production
   (via indirect calorimetry), body heat loss (via direct calorimetry) and
   T-c (via telemetry) were simultaneously quantified during N2O and
   control gas administrations. Initially insensitive rats rapidly acquired
   (3rd administration) a significant allostatic hyperthermic phenotype
   during N2O administration whereas initially sensitive rats exhibited
   classical tolerance (normothermia) during N2O inhalation in the 4th and
   5th sessions. However, the sensitive rats subsequently acquired the
   hyperthermic phenotype and became indistinguishable from initially
   insensitive rats during the 11th and 12th N2O administrations. The major
   mechanism for hyperthermia was a brisk increase in metabolic heat
   production. However, we obtained no evidence for classical conditioning
   of thermal responses. We conclude that the degree of initial sensitivity
   to N2O-induced hypothermia predicts the temporal pattern of thermal
   adaptation over repeated N2O administrations, but that initially
   insensitive and sensitive animals eventually converge to similar (and
   substantial) magnitudes of within-administration hyperthermia mediated
   by hyper-compensatory heat production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1. Interest in the evolutionary origin and maintenance of individual
   behavioural variation and behavioural plasticity has increased in recent
   years.
   2. Consistent individual behavioural differences imply limited
   behavioural plasticity, but the proximate causes and wider consequences
   of this potential constraint remain poorly understood. To date, few
   attempts have been made to explore whether individual variation in
   behavioural plasticity exists, either within or between populations.
   3. We assayed ` exploration behaviour' among wild-caught individual
   great tits Parus major when exposed to a novel environment room in four
   populations across Europe. We quantified levels of individual variation
   within and between populations in average behaviour, and in behavioural
   plasticity with respect to (i) repeated exposure to the room (test
   sequence), (ii) the time of year in which the assays were conducted and
   (iii) the interval between successive tests, all of which indicate
   habituation to novelty and are therefore of functional significance.
   4. Consistent individual differences ('I') in behaviour were present in
   all populations; repeatability (range: 0.34-0.42) did not vary between
   populations. Exploration behaviour was also plastic, increasing with
   test sequence - but less so when the interval between subsequent tests
   was relatively large - and time of year; populations differed in the
   magnitude of plasticity with respect to time of year and test interval.
   Finally, the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour
   increased significantly from first to repeat tests in all populations.
   Individuals with high initial scores showed greater increases in
   exploration score than individuals with low initial scores; individual
   by environment interaction ('I x E') with respect to test sequence did
   not vary between populations.
   5. Our findings imply that individual variation in both average level of
   behaviour and behavioural plasticity may generally characterize wild
   great tit populations and may largely be shaped by mechanisms acting
   within populations. Experimental approaches are now needed to confirm
   that individual differences in behavioural plasticity (habituation) -
   not other hidden biological factors caused the observed patterns of I x
   E. Establishing the evolutionary causes and consequences of this
   variation in habituation to novelty constitutes an exciting future
   challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Both personality and plasticity can influence fitness, but few studies
   have investigated these two sources of individual variation
   simultaneously for the same behaviour. The individual quality hypothesis
   proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be
   better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a
   high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis
   proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated,
   because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to
   rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two
   hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness
   (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this
   behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their
   consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows,
   Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as
   a random effect, we found that consistent differences between
   individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness
   and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to
   variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality
   hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a
   higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a
   reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for
   the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor
   plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results
   suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important
   components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of
   each are context dependent. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined interactions between resource availability,
   life-history traits and sexual conflict on species-specific provisioning
   rates, and within-individual variation of parental care. To this end, we
   used 1129 nest observation periods from 118 nests across 4 populations
   to examine how parental nest visitation varied according to sex, food
   availability, and offspring need (brood size and age) in the stitchbird
   (hihi: Notiomystis cincta). Males increased their provisioning
   proportional to brood size regardless of food availability, whereas
   females did not increase provisioning to larger broods unless food
   supplemented. Male provisioning consistently followed the age-dependent
   energy requirements of the nestlings, whereas females showed little or
   no brood age-provisioning relationships. Thus, males were more sensitive
   than females to changes in the energy demands of their offspring;
   however, this was probably because females were already providing food
   at a high rate and could not respond to increased demand unless given
   additional food. Sex and habitat-specific repeatability estimates of
   parental effort suggest that variation in female provisioning behavior
   tends to be driven by differences in the local environment, whereas
   variation in male provisioning is more related to differences in
   individual quality. These sex-specific responses of parental care can be
   largely explained by the relative benefits of provisioning; females
   provisioned at a high rate to offspring they knew to be their own, based
   on available resources. In contrast, when food was abundant, males did
   not increase their provisioning to offspring probably because of the
   opportunity for additional matings via forced extrapair copulations.}},

   C. 2011. Temperament in beef cattle: methods of measurement and their
   relationship to production. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 557-565. Temperament
   is an individual trait influencing an animal's behavioural response to
   handling. This characteristic likely modulates the response of the
   animal to environments and social situations, and is perhaps best viewed
   as a component of its personality. We assessed temperament using three
   objective measuring tools, to determine if correlations exist between
   these and a traditional subjective evaluation. The tools used were
   strain gauges, a ``movement measuring device{''} (MMD), and a chute exit
   timer. Four hundred steers were used. Exit time was correlated with
   values recorded with the MMD and absolute strain forces, and MMD values
   were related to absolute strain forces. When the animals were classified
   as ``calm{''} or ``wild{''} based on their subjective scoring, these two
   groups differed in their mean exit times, MMD values and absolute strain
   forces. The three objective measures yielded statistically correlated
   results between tests and across repetitions, and therefore may quantify
   correlated aspects of a personality trait (i.e., temperament). The
   objective scores were related to the traditional subjective score, but
   they provide the advantage of eliminating observer bias and may offer
   better tools for temperament selection. Significant positive
   relationships of daily gain with subjective score and M M D values
   indicate that traditional subjective scoring techniques can be replaced
   with more repeatable objective measures when temperaments are assessed
   for performance studies.}},

Abstract = {{Although discrete morphological castes are a rarity in animal societies,
   trait differences among group constituents are pervasive and can have
   similar effects on group function. Spider societies lack discrete
   morphological castes, but colony constituents can differ along any
   number of trait axes (e. g. body size). Here we tested for consistent
   individual differences in social tendency in five tropical spider
   species (genus Anelosimus). We further determined the extent to which
   social tendency is correlated with other aspects of an individual's
   behaviour that might reflect division of labour within colonies. We
   found that all five species showed repeatable within-species variation
   in social tendency, and increased social tendency was correlated with
   reduced aggressiveness towards prey and diminished boldness towards an
   aversive stimulus (i.e. test species shared a similar `behavioural
   syndrome' of aggressiveness/sociality). Furthermore, colonies of some
   species (e.g. Anelosimus eximius, Anelosimus oritoyacu) appeared to be
   composed of varying proportions of two `behavioural types', whereas
   other species (Anelosimus domingo, Anelosimus guacamayos) showed a more
   continuous distribution of trait values. Interestingly, irrespective of
   species, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of
   aggressive colony constituents and group size, where larger colonies
   tended to have fewer aggressive females. Our results indicate that (1)
   the majority of social Anelosimus show similar within-species

Abstract = {{Fearful behavioral responses to handling (temperament) are undesirably
   associated with ADG and meat quality in infrequently handled Bos indicus
   cattle. It has never been assessed whether these relationships exist in
   calmer Bos taurus breeds in systems where handling is more frequent.
   Such systems predominate in some countries where beef production is a
   major agricultural activity. During fattening, 144 crossbred cattle from
   Limousin and Aberdeen Angus sires were assessed for temperament using 4
   approaches: response to movement along a race (race score; 4 occasions),
   restraint in a crush (crush score; 4 occasions), flight speed from the
   crush (flight speed; 4 occasions), and isolation in a pen with a human
   (isolation score; 1 occasion in yr 1, 2 occasions in yr 2). Measurements
   of ADG were made between birth and slaughter and between 16 and 18 mo of
   age during fattening. Fattening occurred indoors on a complete mixed
   diet fed for ad libitum intake. Meat quality was measured by pH, color,
   and Volodkevitch shear force and by a sensory panel. The repeatability
   of temperament traits was 0.17 (race score), 0.35 (crush score), 0.51
   (flight speed), and 0.36 (isolation score). The proportion of the total
   variance of temperament traits attributable to the sire and the social
   group was low (0.003 to 0.402). However, the sire did affect behavior in
   all tests apart from the crush score (ranging from P = 0.02 to P <
   0.001). Correlations between behavior in the different tests (ranging
   from r = 0.21 to 0.54, and P = 0.02 to P < 0.001) apart from
   between-flight speed and isolation score indicate that fearful behavior
   was consistently shown across assessment methods. A calm response in the
   crush score test was associated with a greater ADG during fattening (P =
   0.05), whereas a calm response during the isolation test was associated
   with a greater ADG in cold carcass weight (P = 0.02). Animals with a
   calm isolation score had less tender meat as judged by the sensory panel
   (P = 0.03), but no other effects were apparent between temperament and
   meat quality measures, although several tendencies (0.06 <= P <= 0.10)
   were found. Temperament did not appear to relate to meat quality in this
   study of frequently handled Bos taurus genotypes, which is in contrast
   to other studies using different beef production systems. Genetic
   correlations between temperament and meat quality under these conditions
   could, although not measured in this study, still exist in the absence
   of phenotypic correlations.}},

   Aggressiveness in the Green Swordtail Xiphophorus helleri}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Aggression occurs when individuals compete over limiting resources.
   While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on
   context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that
   consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that
   aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality.
   Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we
   suggest there is merit in modelling both within-and among-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate
   how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models.
   Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male
   green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of
   (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly
   consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also
   show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects,
   which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be
   context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the
   relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory.
   Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate
   models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried
   functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e. g.,
   mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual
   aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Capture and temporary confinement of wild birds are integral parts of
   wildlife management practice and research used, for example, during
   translocation or reintroduction initiatives. We report here on the
   behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild
   blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly
   consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the
   relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations.
   Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration,
   integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day
   confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 +/- 66.6 (mean +/- S.E.)
   and 678.2 +/- 115.8 ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of
   corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8
   and 2.2 ng/mL respectively, P < 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week
   period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased
   propensity for locomotory behaviours (P = 0.001), maintenance behaviours
   (P = 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P = 0.04) over the period of
   captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P < 0.001) decreased,
   probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated
   decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual
   behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation
   days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability
   (Repeatability = 0.592 +/- 0.084, P < 0.0001). Significant
   repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations
   measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability = 0.619 +/- 0.166, P =
   0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability = 0.368
   +/- 0.166, P = 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We
   used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of
   locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was
   positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response
   at release (P = 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation
   days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P
   = 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days
   after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the
   behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity,
   may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement
   that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Recent research in songbirds has demonstrated that male singing behavior
   varies systematically with personality traits such as exploration and
   risk taking. Here we examine whether the production of bird calls, in
   addition to bird songs, is repeatable and related to exploratory
   behavior, using the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) as a
   model. We assessed the exploratory behavior of individual birds in a
   novel environment task. We then recorded the vocalizations and
   accompanying motor behavior of both male and female chickadees, over the
   course of several days, in two different contexts: a control condition
   with no playback and a stressful condition where chick-a-dee mobbing
   calls were played to individual birds. We found that several
   vocalizations and behaviors were repeatable within both a control and a
   stressful context, and across contexts. While there was no relationship
   between vocal output and exploratory behavior in the control context,
   production of alarm and chick-a-dee calls in the stressful condition was
   positively associated with exploratory behavior. These findings are
   important because they show that bird calls, in addition to bird song,
   are an aspect of personality, in that calls are consistent both within

Abstract = {{Personality (consistent differences between individuals in behavior) and
   plasticity (changes within individuals in behavior) are often viewed as
   separate and opposing phenomena. We tested this idea by analyzing
   parental care reaction norms in a bird that exhibits biparental care.
   Personality in provisioning behavior existed (r(IC) = 0.11) and
   persisted despite being reduced after accounting for individual
   differences in environment. Plasticity was also evident and differed
   between the sexes. Male visit rate was associated with changes in brood
   size and time of day, but female visit rate was associated with changes
   in nestling age and date. In both sexes changes in visit rate were
   positively correlated with changes in their partner's visit rate. Both
   sexes also exhibited multidimensional reaction norms; interaction terms
   revealed that within-individual visit rates increased more steeply with
   brood size when nestlings were older, and the effect of the partner's
   visit rate was sensitive to variation in date, precipitation, and the
   focal bird's age. Individuals also varied in how they responded
   (reaction norm slope) to changes in nestling age and partner visits.
   Moreover, parental personality was interdependent with individual
   plasticity in several ways. Individuals of both sexes with a high visit
   rate also responded more positively to changes in nestling age, and
   males also showed this pattern with changes in partner visit rate.
   Explicit use of the behavioral reaction norm integrated personality and
   plasticity, revealed that these are not opposing concepts, and
   stimulated new hypotheses about sexual conflict over care and
   provisioning as a life-history trait.}},

Abstract = {{Animals of many species show consistency in behaviour across time and

   an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent
   variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living
   species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social
   interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This
   study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive
   chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen
   behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in
   at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable
   long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the
   short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed
   with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of
   which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability',
   `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour
   factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were
   analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor
   scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed
   also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait
   expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a

Abstract = {{It has been established that exposure to xenooestrogens can have
   profound effects on reproductive and aggressive behaviours in aquatic
   organisms. Studies on the effects of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) on
   behaviour, however, rarely examine these effects over multiple trials,
   across time, or across contexts. In addition, it is possible that
   individuals vary in their sensitivity to EE2 and individuals may differ
   in the degree to which their behaviour is affected. The study of
   consistent individual differences in behaviour has grown in popularity
   in recent years perhaps because of the evolutionary questions this
   behavioural variation raises. Adult male threespine stickleback
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from an anadromous population repeatedly
   received the simultaneous presentation of a dummy male and dummy female
   conspecific both before and after exposure to a short-term, nominal (15
   ng L(-1)) concentration of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2). These
   before and after measures were then compared against one another as well
   as against responses of males in a control group that was not exposed to
   EE2. Courtship, aggression, and nesting behaviours were all affected by
   EE2 exposure. In addition, behavioural consistency over trials was
   markedly reduced after EE2 exposure, as shown by lower repeatability
   values in the after exposure measures and in weaker correlations between
   the before and after exposure measures in the EE2 group compared to the
   control group. This suggests that male threespine stickleback vary in
   their sensitivity to EE2. This study is one of the first to examine the
   effects of short-term EE2 exposure on behaviour across trials and has
   important implications for population-level fitness consequences of

Abstract = {{Research on consistent individual differences in behavior, or
   ``behavioral syndromes{''}, continues to grow rapidly, and yet, the
   aspects of behavior under consideration have remained remarkably
   limited. Here, we consider individual variation in consistency of choice
   (termed here. ``choosiness{''}), as expressed during habitat choice. We
   repeatedly tested the responses of female Western Black Widows,
   Latrodectus hesperus, to two cues of habitat quality: prey chemical cues
   and variation in web site illuminance. We estimated females' response by
   the distance they positioned themselves from (1) the source of prey
   chemical cues and (2) the darkest edge of our test arena. Individuals
   with low variance in their responses are deemed more ``choosy{''},
   whereas individuals with high variance are deemed less ``choosy{''}.
   Generally, most females initiated web construction near the source of
   the prey chemical cues and tended to place themselves in low-light
   conditions. However, we detected strong, repeatable differences in
   females' intensity of response, and within-individual variance of
   response (i.e., choosiness) was correlated across situations: females
   with highly consistent responses towards cricket chemical cues also
   exhibited highly consistent responses towards variation in light
   conditions. When deprived of food for extended periods, females were
   indistinguishable in their responses towards prey chemical cues, but
   tended to initiate web construction in brighter lighting conditions.
   Food-deprived females universally exhibited higher variance and
   diminished consistency in their responses (i.e., they were less choosy).
   Additionally, higher choosiness was associated with greater mass loss
   during choice trials, suggesting choosiness is energetically costly. Our
   results demonstrate that consistency of response to environmental cues
   is yet another element of behavior that varies among individuals and
   variation in choosiness could beget speed/quality trade-offs during
   animal decision making.}},

   the evolution of male ornaments. Although several different methods have
   been developed to assess sexual preference in some standardized way, the
   most commonly used procedure consists of recording female spatial
   association with different males presented simultaneously. Sexual
   preference is then inferred from time spent in front of each male.
   However, the extent to which the measurement of female mate-choice is
   related to exploration tendencies has not been addressed so far. In the
   present study we assessed the influence of variation in exploration
   tendencies, a trait closely associated to global personality, on the
   measurement of female mating preference in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia
   guttata) using the widely used four-chamber choice-apparatus. The number
   of movements performed within both exploration and mate-choice apparatus
   was consistent within and across the two contexts. In addition,
   personality explained variation in selectivity, preference strength and
   consistency. High-exploratory females showed lower selectivity, lower
   preference scores and displayed more consistent preference scores. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality may affect the measurement
   of female mating preference and may contribute to explain existing
   inconsistencies across studies.}},

Abstract = {{How animals deal with the challenges posed by their ecological and
   social surroundings often hinges on the acquisition and storage of
   information about those surroundings. That is, an animal's fitness may
   be influenced by variation in the mental representations it has formed
   of its environment. Studying such variation is challenging because it
   involves documenting inherently subjective phenomena. However,
   observations of behaviour may provide objective descriptions of mental
   representations. We used the behaviour of Frontinella communis spiders
   after removal of prey from their webs as an assay of the contents of
   their memories of the prey. Spiders searched for lost prey, exerting
   greater effort in searching for larger prey, and distinguishing between
   the object of the search and old prey remnants. We thus infer that
   spider memories included information about prey features such as size or
   quality. We found significant repeatability in the spiders' searching
   behaviour, suggesting repeatability in memory content. As an indication
   of consistent between-individual differences in searching and memory,
   these repeatability estimates suggest that selection may act to shape
   mental representations and their relationship with foraging behaviour.}},

   given the obvious advantages of using invertebrates/clones to tackle the
   crucial question why such consistent behavioral differences exist. Here
   we show that individuals of clonal pea aphids exhibit consistent
   behavioral differences in their escape responses to a predator attack
   (dropping vs. nondropping off a plant). However, behavior was not

   various phenotypes but different clones produced different proportions

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{467-477}},

Abstract = {{Helpers in cooperatively breeding groups can vary hugely in the variety
   and level of care they provide. Several studies suggest that kin
   selection alone cannot be invoked to explain variation in helping for
   many species, but there have been few explicit tests of this under
   controlled conditions. Here, we investigated whether relatedness to the
   breeding pair or consistent individual differences in behaviours
   explained variation in helping by the cooperatively breeding cichlid
   Neolamprologus pulcher. We established standardized social groups
   consisting of a breeding pair and one related (r = 0.5) and one
   unrelated (r = 0) helper. Two forms of helping, territory maintenance
   and territory defence, were measured repeatedly under controlled
   conditions: helping was variable between, but consistent within,
   individuals. Furthermore, there was some evidence that helpers that
   carried out more maintenance also performed more defence. Contrary to
   the kin selection hypothesis, relatedness did not predict the amount or
   variety of helping executed. Risk responsiveness, activity levels and
   aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals, so constituted
   `behavioural types' (or personality traits), but were uncorrelated with
   each other. More aggressive, risk-prone or more active helpers
   participated in more territory defence than submissive, risk-averse or
   inactive helpers. Risk-prone individuals contributed more to territory
   maintenance than risk-averse helpers. Overall, differences in
   behavioural type, rather than relatedness, explained most variation in
   helping behaviour in N. pulcher. This study highlights the importance of
   considering consistent individual differences in behaviour for
   predicting participation and performance in complex social interactions.

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to compare horses' heart rate (FIR),
   heart rate variability (RMSSD, pNN50) and behaviour in the same
   temperament test when being ridden, led, and released free. Behavioural
   measurements included scores and linear measurements for reactivity (R),
   activity (A), time to calm down (T) and emotionality (E), recorded
   during the approach (1) and/or during confrontation with the stimulus
   (2). Sixty-five horses were each confronted 3 times (1 ridden, 1 led, 1
   free running in balanced order) with 3 novel and/or sudden stimuli.
   Mixed model analysis indicated that leading resulted in the lowest (P <
   0.05 throughout) reactions as measured by A1, A2, El, E2, R2, and pNN50
   while riding produced the strongest (A1, T2, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) or medium
   (El, E2, R2) reactions. Free running resulted either in the strongest
   (A2, El, E2, R2) or in the lowest (A1, 12, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) reactions.
   The repeatability across tests for HR (0.57), but not for RMSSD (0.23)
   or pNN50 (0.25) was higher than for any behavioural measurement: the
   latter ranged from values below 0.10 (A1, A2,T2) to values between 0.30
   and 0.45 (El, E2, R2). Overall, the results show that a rider or handler
   influences, but not completely masks, the horses' intrinsic behaviour in
   a temperament test, and this influence appeared to be stronger on
   behavioural variables and heart rate variability than on the horses'
   heart rates. Taking both practical considerations and repeatabilities
   into account, reactivity appears to be the most valuable parameter.
   Emotionality and heart rate can also yield valid results reflecting
   additional dimensions of temperament although their practical relevance
   may be less obvious. If a combination of observed variables is chosen
   with care, a valid assessment of a horse's temperament may be possible
   in all types of tests. However, in practice, tests that resemble the
   practical circumstances most closely, i.e. testing riding horses under a
   rider, should be chosen. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Feed intake is commonly used as one of the most important performance
   indicators in fish. However, very little is known about the behavioural
   processes involved in ingesting food such as meal duration, feeding
   frequency and latency to start eating. This study aims at the
   characterization of feeding behaviour in Nile tilapia Oreochromis
   niloticus in terms of consistency of individual differences over time
   and correlation with performance traits. Seventy-two individuals were
   individually housed for 27 days. These fish had three different weight
   (age) categories: low (initial body weight: 61.32 +/- 5.97 g), middle
   (151.19 +/- 4.26 g) and high (265.90 +/- 19.13 g), each containing 24
   fish. Daily feed intake was recorded per fish. On days 8, 15 and 21
   feeding behaviour was assessed by measuring the latency to start feeding
   (LAT. min), the total feeding time (TFT, min) and the number of feeding
   acts (NFA). In the end of the experimental period, fish were weighed and
   individual growth rate and feed efficiency (measured as residual feed
   intake) determined. Results show that feeding latency and the number of
   feeding acts have significant repeatability estimates for all weight
   classes. These estimates were, however, low in magnitude and decreased
   as the weight class increased. The correlation between the different
   feeding behaviours showed that individuals that are more active during
   feeding (higher NFA) on average, start to consume their feed earlier
   (lower LAT) and for longer periods (higher TFT). The number of feeding
   acts was significantly correlated with both feed intake and growth in
   all size classes. The residual feed intake was correlated with feeding
   latency only in the small weight class. These results showed that
   individual differences in feeding behaviour have low repeatability
   estimates and can partly explain differences in performance traits in
   juveniles of Nile tilapia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In several bird and mammal species, contact calls are utilized to
   maintain group cohesion and coordinate group movement. From a signal
   design perspective, contact calls typically exhibit acoustic features
   that make them easily localizable and encode information about
   individual or group identity. Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) are
   unusual among vespertilionids in that they often emit a loud, partially
   audible frequency-modulated social call several times in rapid
   succession while in flight. This call appears to function as a contact
   call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and
   perform circular flights before entering a crevice roost. However, the
   degree to which pallid bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and
   what information is provided in the call is unknown. Thus, the goal of
   this study was to investigate pallid bat calling behavior to determine
   if calls attract roostmates or elicit responses from them and provide
   sufficient information for individual recognition. In playback studies,
   we found that contact calls elicit calls and approaches and that
   free-flying bats respond more to familiar than unfamiliar calls. In
   addition, analysis of frequency and temporal measurements of calls
   collected from multiple sites and spectral cross correlation analysis of
   calls recorded from the same radio-tagged bats on multiple evenings
   revealed that the frequency pattern of contact calls is highly
   repeatable over time within individuals but exhibits significant
   differences among individuals. Thus, contact call structure appears to
   be unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these
   calls well-suited for roostmate recognition.}},

Abstract = {{`Animal personality' means that individuals differ from one another in
   either single behaviours or suites of related behaviours in a way that
   is consistent over time. It is usually assumed that such consistent
   individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how
   individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than
   by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat.
   Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect
   `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals
   with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle
   responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether
   personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a
   simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among
   individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three
   week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool
   temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in
   microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a
   range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could
   have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of
   individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A.
   equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may
   be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in

Abstract = {{The evolution and ecology of consistent behavioural variation, or
   personality, is currently the focus of much attention in natural
   populations. Associations between personality traits and parasite
   infections are increasingly being reported, but the extent to which
   multiple behavioural traits might be associated with parasitism at the
   same time is largely unknown. Here, we use a population of great tits,
   Parus major, to examine whether infection by avian malaria (Plasmodium
   and Leucocytozoon) is associated with three behavioural traits assayed
   under standardized conditions. All of these traits are of broad
   ecological significance and two of them are repeatable or heritable in
   our population. Here, we show weak correlations between some but not all
   of these behavioural traits, and sex-dependent associations between all
   three behavioural traits and parasite infection. Infected males showed
   increased problem-solving performance whereas infected females showed
   reduced performance; furthermore, uninfected females were four times
   more likely to solve problems than uninfected males. Infected females
   were more exploratory than uninfected females, but infection had no
   effect on males. Finally, infected males were more risk-averse than
   uninfected males but females were unaffected. Our results demonstrate
   the potential for complex interactions between consistent personality
   variation and parasite infection, though we discuss the difficulty of

Abstract = {{Two divergent behavioural and physiological response patterns to
   challenges have been identified in mammals and birds, frequently termed
   the proactive and reactive coping styles. In recent years, individually
   distinct coping styles have also been observed in several species of
   fish. These individual differences may result in suboptimal production
   and compromised welfare in aquaculture. An approach to overcome these
   problems could be to sort fish and optimise rearing conditions according
   to coping style. It has been previously demonstrated that the proactive
   and reactive coping styles in fish can be characterised by contrasting
   behavioural responses to hypoxia. Two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) strains, bred for a low- (LR) and high- (HR) cortisol response
   to a standardized stressor, are suggested to resemble the proactive and
   reactive coping styles respectively. Therefore, these fish provided an
   opportunity for verifying a method for sorting fish with respect to
   coping style by exposure to hypoxia. Groups consisting of 24
   individually tagged fish, 12 HR and 12 LR were exposed to hypoxia in a
   two choice system. The system consisted of a ``home{''} tank provided
   with cover connected to a second brightly ``illuminated{''} tank via a
   closable doorway. During the experiment, the doorway between the two
   tanks was opened and hypoxic conditions were gradually induced in the
   ``home{''} tank by bubbling with nitrogen. The latency time to move away
   from hypoxic conditions to normoxic conditions in the second tank was
   recorded for each individual. The oxygen saturation in each tank was
   measured every 30 min. The experiment consisted of two trials. Each
   trial was carried out in two sessions, switching the ``home{''} tank and
   ``illuminated{''} tank between Sessions 1 and 2. The results indicated
   that the response to hypoxia differed significantly between LR and HR
   individuals in both Session 1 (P < 0.05) and Session 2 (P <= 0.001).
   Furthermore, a higher number of HR individuals left hypoxic conditions
   compared to LR individuals in both Session 1 (P = 0.001) and Session 2
   (P <= 0.001). Taken together, the findings of the present study
   demonstrate a repeatable difference in behavioural response to hypoxia
   between the two strains. The method presented could be utilized as a
   non-invasive method for sorting fish according to stress coping style.

Abstract = {{Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is highly variable between individuals
   within a single species and the relationship between body mass and RMR
   does not wholly explain this variability. One factor that could account
   for a portion of the residual variation is animal personality or
   consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, but no study has
   examined this relationship in a free-living population of mammals. In
   this paper, we test for a relationship between RMR and CIDs in activity
   in live-trapped meadow voles Microtus pennsylvanicus after controlling
   for the effect of body mass. We quantified the activity levels of voles
   both in an unfamiliar environment and for the first 2 min in the
   metabolic apparatus, and then measured RMR using open-flow respirometry.
   As expected, there was a linear relationship between RMR and body mass,
   and we found strong evidence for repeatable differences in activity
   levels between individuals. However, contrary to the hypothesis, we did
   not identify a significant correlation between CIDs in behaviour and RMR
   after controlling for body mass. Our results suggest that, at least
   within species, higher activity levels may not require a greater
   investment in energetically demanding tissues or increased capacity for
   processing of energy. Alternatively, if a relationship exists, our
   inability to detect it may reflect a weak behavioural signal in noisy
   RMR data that are influenced by many factors. Our results could also
   reflect an artefact of individual responses to stress or a sampling bias

Abstract = {{Recent evidence strongly suggests that natural selection can favour the
   evolution of consistent individual differences in behaviour
   ('personalities'). Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has
   been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of
   personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore,
   the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's
   fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a
   factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to
   affect individual success in competition by interference in a few
   species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored.
   We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of
   personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata.
   In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four
   individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play
   producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session,
   individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency
   in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social
   contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success
   during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory
   birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer
   tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were
   presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss
   our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality
   and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the
   evolution of personality. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during development can have long-lasting
   effects on morphology, physiology and behaviour. In contrast to human
   personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences
   the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish,
   Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through
   time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable
   behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social
   conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in
   combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult.
   Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements
   and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest
   mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male.
   Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social
   treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or
   became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was
   not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular
   mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to
   females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult
   were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult
   female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that
   contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and
   that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects
   of the early environment. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Preschool-aged children continually learn new skills and perfect
   existing ones. ``Mastery motivation{''} is theorized to be a personality
   trait linked to skill learning. The Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire
   (DMQ) quantifies mastery motivation. This pilot study evaluated DMQ
   test-retest score reliability (preschool-version) and included
   exploratory analysis of test-retest score reliability with a subgroup of
   children with a physical disability. The child's parent completed the
   DMQ twice (30-day mean retest interval) and rated DMQ for ease of use.
   Test-retest score reliability was estimated for DMQ Total, aspect and
   scale scores using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
   Thirty-three mothers participated (children's mean age = 4 years 1
   month, SD = 1 year 2 months). Total score and expressive aspect
   test-retest score reliability were good (ICCs 0.76 and 0.70,
   respectively) and instrumental aspect test-retest score reliability was
   excellent (ICC = 0.87). Five of the 7 scales had ICCs > 0.74. The
   mastery pleasure scale scored lowest in test-retest score reliability
   (ICC = 0.35). Total score test-retest reliability was good for children
   who have a disability (n = 12) and in children typically developing (n =
   21): ICCs 0.71 and 0.79, respectively. The DMQ was found to be easy to
   complete using a 5-point scale with ``1{''} being ``very difficult{''}
   and ``5{''} being ``very easy.{''} The mothers' mean score was 4.4/5.
   This pilot work indicated acceptable test-retest score reliability for

Abstract = {{Many animals store food in small, widely dispersed scatter hoards or in
   large larder hoards in burrows or other centralized locations. Kangaroo
   rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in
   food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used
   laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding
   by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys
   merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in
   arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and
   individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their
   behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some
   subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both
   species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding
   propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between
   males as well as greater variation between trials for individual
   females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace
   lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's
   kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding
   behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating
   strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache
   pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with
   differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This
   study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural
   plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and
   females. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{In this study we investigate whether rearing environment (wild vs.
   hatchery) affects the ability of brown trout parr (Salmo trutta) to
   learn two foraging tasks. Hatchery- and wild-reared brown trout were
   trained in two different foraging tasks: locating food hidden in a maze
   and finding a cryptic prey, and their performance within and across
   tasks was compared. Fish reduced their search time for cryptic prey, but
   not maze search time, by learning. In contrast to most previous studies
   hatchery-reared trout generally tended to be more successful feeders and
   showed faster learning than wild trout when foraging on cryptic prey.
   This appeared to be due to motivational effects rather than based on
   cognitive skills. In addition, we examine whether exploration behaviour
   in brown trout is repeatable across time and context (i.e. reflecting a
   behavioural syndrome). Individual exploration tendency was repeatable
   within tasks, suggesting the occurrence of personality in brown trout.
   However, individuals that were fast explorers in the cryptic prey task
   were not necessarily fast to explore the maze. Thus, a context-specific
   behavioural syndrome was found to best explain exploratory behaviour for
   both hatchery and wild trout. However, repeatability of exploration
   behaviour within tasks differed between hatchery and wild trout, where
   wild trout were found to be more consistent in their exploration

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1055-1061}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ in their behavioural reactions to the
   environment. Consistent individual differences in these behaviours
   (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural
   selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in
   physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation
   in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in
   several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for
   personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in
   controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological
   differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might
   cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying
   these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma
   testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced
   immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially
   selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow'
   exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly
   repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the
   season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently
   higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than
   `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for
   variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in
   hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels
   do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels.
   Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of
   selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms
   and the phenotypic traits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Flight speed (FS) is an objective measure of the behavioural response to
   handling procedures in beef cattle but to date there is no published
   work on dairy cattle. It is useful to determine whether there is
   consistency in FS in dairy cattle, and assess the relationship between
   FS and other subjective measures of responsiveness in dairy cattle. The
   aims of this study were to: (a) evaluate the repeatability of the FS and
   crush score (CS) test in dairy cattle by repeated measurements and (b)
   examine the correlation of FS and CS with reactivity responses in a
   human approach test (HAT). FS and CS measurements for 55
   Holstein-Friesian heifers were conducted three times at 4-week
   intervals. Flight response to a HAT was assessed in the passageway of
   the home-pen on a subset of 33 animals. On completion of the HAT, an
   assessment of six qualitative terms (at ease, friendly, bold, docile,
   shy, fearful and nervous) were assessed on a visual analogue scale
   according to a subjective judgement of whether a cow scored low or high
   for each term. Correlations between the three monthly repetitions of FS
   measurements were all significant and positive (FS(1,2): r(s)=0.36,
   P=0.007: FS(2,3): r(s)=0.31, P=0.002: FS(1,3): r(s)=0.47, P<0.001) which
   indicates a level of individual consistency. No significant correlations
   between the three monthly repetitions of CS measurements were found. The
   mean FS was correlated with HAT flight response (r(s)=0.42, P=0.004).
   However, no significant correlations existed between the HAT and the CS.
   In conclusion, the results suggest that both HAT and FS measurements
   provide consistent (both intra- and inter-measure) assessments of
   temperament under these handling situations in dairy cows. (C) 2011

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Current work in behavioral ecology contrasts traditional hypotheses of
   context-specific adaptation with the suggestion that behaviors are often
   coupled such that animals exhibit context-general behavioral syndromes.
   Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is
   a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high
   (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the
   product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted
   spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance.
   Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome
   of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not
   consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider
   the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in
   wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that
   reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across
   the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats
   throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging
   voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2,
   7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition
   alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results
   indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack,
   ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces
   wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither
   repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and
   therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We
   discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of
   predation risk and mate attraction.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioural syndromes have experienced rapid
   increase in interest in the last few years because of their possible
   role in the evolution of life histories. However, there is still a
   scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in
   behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In
   this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on
   the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the
   identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus
   arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of
   family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family)
   on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in
   two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm
   maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The
   study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was
   consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE
   corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed
   behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by
   the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and
   maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family.
   It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here
   is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further
   studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole
   personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the
   opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in
   more natural circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a method of measuring sheep activity in confinement

   show that an algorithm to analyse continuous weight records could be
   used to measure activity quickly and efficiently using commercial
   weighing equipment and that this measurement is related to animal
   productivity, specifically liveweight. A prototype method required
   magnetic switches on the weighing crate to record gate positioning and
   enclosure of the animal, with data analysis subsequent to the completion
   of weighing. The method reported here does not require additional
   equipment, instead using a computer program to analyse weights in
   real-time to record the degree of sheep movement. The result is
   summarised as the coefficient of variation of the weight over a period
   of 8-20 s and reported as an activity score.
   The real-time method had a higher repeatability (P < 0.05) than the
   prototype method and gave a stronger association with liveweight with
   heavier lambs and heavier young sheep being less active under
   confinement at 6 months and 18 months, respectively (P < 0.05).
   These findings indicate that a simple system could be developed enabling

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences, often referred to as behavioral
   syndromes, are characterized by individuals behaving in a consistent,
   predictable manner while differing from others. This phenomenon appears
   to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or
   changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even
   exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time
   they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few
   studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of
   consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta
   splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with
   a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these
   responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined
   how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of
   conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics.
   Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as
   after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of
   behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter
   their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with
   the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after
   exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed
   behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher
   repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more
   resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral
   strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral
   flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how
   experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in
   both courtship and aggressive situations.}},

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Individuals select from a number of behaviours when responding to
   various situations and the decisions they make may affect their fitness.
   The costs and benefits of these responses vary among individuals causing
   them to differ even in identical situations. One example of this type of
   situation is when territorial males encounter both a male and female
   simultaneously, generating a trade-off that likely leads to individual
   differences due to differing costs of various actions among males. This
   situation commonly occurs in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus. However, for selection to act effectively, individuals must
   behave in a consistent manner and measuring repeatability can aid in
   understanding how selection may shape such trade-offs. Males of this
   species exhibit consistent individual differences in their response to
   dummy males and females but it is unknown if patterns are similar when
   feedback from the stimuli is present. To assess this, male threespine
   stickleback were tested with dummy and live male and female
   conspecifics, presented separately and simultaneously. While the same
   trends were found regardless of stimulus type, males were more
   aggressive towards the live conspecifics than to the dummies.
   Repeatability values were similar within a treatment regardless of
   whether live or dummy conspecifics were used, suggesting that
   individuals show the same level of consistency. This study adds to our
   understanding of consistent individual differences by demonstrating that
   feedback may not affect responses to conflicting stimuli and that male
   threespine stickleback respond in a consistent manner to both dummy and
   live stimuli {[}Current Zoology 57 (1): 101-108, 2011].}},

Abstract = {{Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated
   behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider
   correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and
   correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity,
   neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy),
   in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent
   personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this
   gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly
   repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of
   them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome.
   Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive
   individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that
   personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing
   within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of
   the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take
   several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual
   personality. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in context-general behavioral
   traits (often called personality traits) are particularly interesting
   for behavioral ecologists because they might show unexpected
   cross-context correlations and explain maladaptive behavior. In order to
   understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the
   heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive
   success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain
   variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to
   novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment.
   Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic
   variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair
   paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and
   nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well
   as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects
   had little influence on these components of reproductive success.
   However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational
   sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel
   object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the
   sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual
   selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We
   conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive

Abstract = {{Background: The Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis (ADAD) has been a gold
   standard for assessing drug use and associated problems in adolescents.
   Criticism of the instrument has been increasing. A new instrument, the
   European Adolescent Assessment Dialogue (EuroADAD) that builds on ADAD's
   strengths but seeks to address its limitations is now available, but has
   not been subjected to comprehensive psychometric evaluation. Objective:
   To examine the psychometric properties of the EuroADAD across various
   settings in adolescent populations who developed or were at a high risk
   of developing substance use and psychosocial adaptation problems.
   Participants and Settings: Three of the samples were collected in
   Hungary, including: institutionalized youths from juvenile residential
   facility (n = 295); adolescents from outpatient psychiatry facility (n =
   278), and controls (n = 59). An additional sample was collected in the
   Netherlands, and consisted of adolescent boys from an independent
   residential institution for youth with severe behavioral problems (n =
   51). Procedure: The EuroADAD was administered by trained interviewers.
   Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and self-report
   questionnaires. Results: Reliability: the intraclass correlation was
   high for all domains of the EuroADAD; reliability analyses indicated
   good test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Validity:
   difference among study samples was significant (p < 0.05) for the
   majority of the domains, with juvenile institution and psychiatric
   outpatient subjects exhibiting higher severity in most areas compared to
   controls. The Hungarian and Dutch samples were comparable, expect for
   the legal domain, due to the higher severity of behavioral problems in
   the Dutch sample. Several domains of the instrument, including
   `alcohol', `drugs' and `legal' showed an association with trait
   aggression as measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and
   with Novelty Seeking on the Cloninger Temperament and Character
   Inventory. Conclusion: Based on the pattern and significance of group
   differences, and correlations with other measures, the scale has good
   criterion, and convergent and discriminant construct validity. The
   EuroADAD is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of alcohol and
   drug use, and related psychosocial problems in adolescents. Copyright

   Comparisons of the activity levels showed that both males and females

Abstract = {{Personality means an individual's unique way of behaving and reacting to
   the environment. It is a stable and heritable trait, which is expressed
   consistently in different situations. The aim of our study was to
   develop novel tests to depict the personality structure of the bank vole
   Myodes glareolus, and to determine if the phase of the population cycle,
   i.e. population density, affects personality. We focused on some central
   aspects of bank vole behaviour: mobility, risk taking, exploratory
   behaviour, dominance, and aggressive behaviour towards pups. These
   behaviours were chosen because they directly affect bank vole survival
   or fitness or are classified as important factors of personality in
   other species. In total, 192 males from different populations went
   through four behavioural tests, in which 20 variables were measured. The
   tests were repeated after 3 weeks, which verified that all traits were
   stable, i.e. repeatable between trials. Three personality compounds
   emerged, named extroversion, novelty seeking and infanticide.
   Extroversion included dominance and mobility, while novelty seeking
   consisted of risk taking and exploration. Infanticide encompassed all
   indices measuring harmful behaviour towards pups. Mobility and dominance
   were connected, possibly because both seem to depend on condition. Time
   spent in captivity increased extroversion, which may be explained by
   good food, stable conditions and acclimation to strong social cues.
   Novelty seeking was connected to repeatability which could mean that
   novelty avoiding individuals adjust their behaviour to match new
   environments. Population density affected the infanticide trait but not
   novelty seeking or extroversion.}},

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show
   individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and
   context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human
   personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a
   social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a
   behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response
   of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a
   foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower
   colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As
   for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel
   stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to
   known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model,
   we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response
   to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour
   over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used
   here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal
   personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural
   response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day
   basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Although sleep is fundamental for survival, not much is known about
   sleep behaviour in free-living animals and between-individual variation
   in sleep patterns has hardly been studied, except in humans. We analysed
   sleep behaviour in a free-living population of blue tits in southern
   Germany. We recorded individuals roosting in nestboxes between November
   and April using infrared-sensitive cameras. We investigated the
   following sleep parameters: time of entering and leaving the nestbox,
   sleep onset, awakening time, sleep duration, midpoint of sleep, latency
   to sleep and frequency and duration of nocturnal awakenings. Sleep
   onset, awakening time and sleep duration followed seasonal changes in
   daylength. Blue tits slept ca. 4.8 h longer inwinter than in spring.
   During the night, birds woke up between 23 and 230 times, but this did
   not change seasonally. Local light conditions influenced awakening time:
   birds at brighter locations woke up earlier. Females slept on average 15
   min longer per night than males and this sex difference became more
   pronounced in early spring. Although females spent a greater proportion
   of the night awake than males, they still slept more overall. First-year
   birds spent more time in the nestbox after waking up and left the
   nestbox later in the morning than older individuals. Repeatability
   estimates showed that individuals were consistent in their sleep
   behaviour over the 2-year study period. Our results indicate that sleep
   patterns are individual-specific traits in blue tits. We suggest that
   the observed sex difference in sleep duration is caused by sexual

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The open-field test, which measures animal activity or distance covered
   by individuals subjected to a novel arena, is used frequently in
   behaviour studies. Studies generally report consistent individual
   differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested
   whether individuals change their activity level differently within a
   single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability
   of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the
   duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction
   norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in
   temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual
   temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias
   striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the
   total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time
   intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5
   min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain
   differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first
   time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated
   with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests
   yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend
   analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity
   measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity
   patterns. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are interindividual behavioral differences that are
   consistent across time or contexts. Increasing research is revealing the
   adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving
   this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in
   personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of
   selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured
   indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally
   sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information
   currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability.
   We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common
   personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of
   rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific
   measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of
   hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3
   measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal
   consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed
   was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only
   repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These
   differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the
   correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial
   number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas
   population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel
   environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since
   capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of
   using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of
   personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational
   patterns of trait repeatability.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the
   intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for
   quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of
   phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be
   attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a
   consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the
   sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several
   ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no
   formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for
   non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition
   to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors
   and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability
   estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the
   methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for
   Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three
   common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model
   (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on
   generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation
   of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We
   also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors,
   confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and
   recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests
   and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based
   approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables
   can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of
   repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in
   relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a
   collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate
   repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective force in most natural systems,
   potentially fueling evolutionary changes in prey morphology, life
   history and behaviour. Recent work has suggested that contrasting
   predation pressures may lead to population differentiation in
   personality traits. However, there are indications that these
   personality traits also differ between sexes and not necessarily in a
   consistent way between populations. We used an integrative approach to
   quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught
   guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and
   size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality
   traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on
   emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged
   sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities.
   We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than
   females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was
   non-significant in all populations. We discuss what responses to expect
   from predator-nave versus predator-experienced individuals and how this
   can be linked to the shyness-boldness continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes describe consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioural traits. Quantifying individual differences
   often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity
   while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared
   behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and
   long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological
   contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was
   similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the
   presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap,
   respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel
   object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of
   annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home
   territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across
   ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a
   behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and
   exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in
   risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a
   familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate
   measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term
   responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in
   related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated
   ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context

Abstract = {{The ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes is little studied in
   cooperative breeding systems where it is assumed that the behavioural
   type might influence individual decisions on helping and dispersal (e.g.
   shy, nonaggressive and nonexplorative individuals remain philopatric and
   helpful, whereas bold, aggressive, explorative individuals compete for
   vacancies outside their group and disperse). We measured the behavioural
   type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six
   behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different
   contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or
   nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context
   repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal
   individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or
   the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the
   tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits
   per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the
   across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except
   for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the
   context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could
   be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction
   towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies
   in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not
   included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are
   needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration
   propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and

Abstract = {{Individuals must often decide among a range of behavioral responses in a
   given situation and individuals will likely vary from one another in the
   choices they make. A rarely explored example of this is when both a male
   and a female are present simultaneously and a male must decide to fight
   or court. Consistent individual differences have been found in
   decision-making in Siamese fighting fish: however, dummies were used to
   explore this question and it is possible that individuals respond
   differently in this situation when faced with live stimuli as a result
   of feedback. Therefore, this study investigated whether males behave
   similarly to dummy and live stimuli by exposing them to male and female
   conspecifics both simultaneously and separately. Subjects were tested
   first with dummies and then in the same situations using live
   conspecifics. It was hypothesized that males would respond in the same
   manner to both the dummy and live fish. The results indicated that
   individuals behaved similarly to the dummy fish and the live fish in
   corresponding conditions. In addition, repeatability levels suggest that
   individuals behaved similarly across trials of a given treatment type

   demonstrates that males are consistent in their responses even when

Abstract = {{Prenatal androgens are generally assumed to permanently affect the

   permanent effect of prenatal masculinization, we hypothesized that the

   (interindividual differences in the AGDI measurement should persist over
   time). In contrast to our prediction, the AGDI showed poor repeatability

Abstract = {{Resting is important for regeneration and disturbances are welfare

   this study aimed to identify feasible and reliable resting measures in
   terms of inter-observer reliability (IOR) and consistency of results per
   farm over time that can be included in an on-farm welfare assessment
   protocol. Altogether 15 measures were investigated. They were recorded
   during three farms visits (approximately 60 and a further 120 days
   apart) on 35 farms in Austria and Germany with cubicle, deep litter and
   tie stall systems. Seven measures occurred too infrequently (<1/h and
   1\% respectively) to allow reliable recording within a limited
   observation time. IOR was generally acceptable to excellent (Spearman's
   r=0.7-1.0), except for `collision during lying down' with a PABAK of 0.2
   (n = 15, observed on farm). However, after improvement of the definition
   IOR was good (0.78, n=65, observed from videos). Only three measures
   were acceptably repeatable overtime. `duration of lying down' (Kendall's
   W=0.78 for a minimum of 6 recorded occurrences), `percentage of
   collisions during lying down' (W=0.95) and `percentage of cows lying
   partly or completely outside lying area' (W=0.87). These measures are
   evaluated as suitable animal based welfare measures regarding resting
   behaviour in the framework of an on-farm welfare assessment protocol.
   They can be easily and reliably recorded within 2 h during a farm visit
   require only a short training period and show sufficient consistency of
   results over time. They, moreover, allow distinction between different
   housing systems. However their sensitivity with regard to differences

   While repeatability of provisioning was relatively invariant across

Abstract = {{Individual hormone profiles can be important generators of phenotypic
   variation. Despite this, work on the consequences of hormone profiles
   has traditionally ignored the large inter-individual variation within
   natural populations. However, recent research has advocated the need to
   explicitly consider this variation and address its consequences for
   selection. One of the key steps in this process is examining
   repeatability in hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits
   under selection. In this study we show that individuals within a
   free-ranging population of the Australian lizard Egemia whitii exhibit
   temporal repeatability in their circulating baseline testosterone
   concentrations as well as their aggressive response towards conspecific
   intruders. Furthermore, we show significant, sex-specific links between
   testosterone and aggression. Specifically, testosterone and aggression
   is negatively linked in males, while there is no relationship in
   females. As conspecific aggression has significant consequences for
   fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in this
   species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations,
   through their effects on aggression, could have important implications
   for individual fitness. We discuss the potential causes and consequences
   of hormonal repeatability as well as provide explanations for its
   sex-specific links with aggression. Specifically, we suggest that these
   patterns are the result of alternative hormonal pathways governing
   aggression within Egemia and may indicate a decoupling of aggression and

Abstract = {{Animal temperament describes behavioural differences between individuals
   that are consistent across time and contexts. Variation in animal
   temperament is rapidly gaining interest and attention within behavioural
   and evolutionary ecology. If we are to understand the causes and
   consequences of temperament variation within and between populations we
   need to determine the selection pressures that affect temperament in
   natural environments. To date, however, the vast majority of temperament
   studies have been carried out on captive-bred individuals. This review
   highlights potential problems that arise from using captive animals to
   elucidate the ecological and evolutionary functions of temperament in
   wild populations. For example, development, learning and environmental
   variability can all affect behaviour. Thus, both environment and gene-by
   environment interactions can affect the fitness functions of different
   temperaments, and hence selection. We stress the need for measurements
   of repeatability and heritability, and the importance of biological and
   ecological validation of temperament tests in wild animals. We describe
   the limited evidence from wild populations of the fitness consequences
   of temperament variation, and the use of intra- and inter-specific
   comparisons to prove adaptation. To identify multiple axes of
   behavioural variation, and how these interact with environments that
   vary spatially and temporally, we need long-term studies on wild
   populations - yet few studies of this nature currently exist. Finally,

Abstract = {{According to basic evoludonary theory, individuals within a population
   should adapt their behavior in response to their current physical and
   social environment. However, there is now evidence from a diverse range
   of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad
   behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally
   shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that
   there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We
   aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama
   (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual
   male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome?
   and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with
   individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas
   by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual
   agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder
   males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving
   throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a
   behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home
   ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail
   loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the
   form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We
   suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral

Abstract = {{Consistent individual behavioural tendencies, termed

   Functional explanations for personality have been proposed, but as yet,
   very little consideration has been given to a possible role for sexual
   selection in maintaining differences in personality and its stability
   within individuals. We provide an overview of the available literature
   on the role of personality traits in intrasexual competition and mate
   choice in both human and non-human animals and integrate this into a
   framework for considering how sexual selection can generate and maintain
   personality. For this, we consider the evolution and maintenance of both
   main aspects of animal personality: inter-individual variation and
   intra-individual consistency.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Animals must allocate some proportion of their time to detecting
   predators. In birds and mammals, such anti-predator vigilance has been
   well studied, and we know that it may be influenced by a variety of
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite hundreds of studies focusing on
   vigilance and suggestions that there are individual differences in
   vigilance, there have been no prior studies examining its heritability
   in the field. Here, we present one of the first reports of (additive)
   genetic variation in vigilance. Using a restricted maximum likelihood
   procedure, we found that, in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota
   flaviventris), the heritability of locomotor ability (h2 = 0.21), and
   especially vigilance (h2 = 0.08), is low. These modest heritability
   estimates suggest great environmental variation or a history of
   directional selection eliminating genetic variation in these traits. We
   also found a significant phenotypic (r(P) = -0.09 +/- 0.04, P = 0.024)
   and a substantial, but not significant, genetic correlation (r(A) =
   -0.57 +/- 0.28, P = 0.082) between the two traits (slower animals are
   less vigilant while foraging). We found no evidence of differential
   survival or longevity associated with particular phenotypes of either
   trait. The genetic correlation may persist because of environmental
   heterogeneity and genotype-by-environment interactions maintaining the
   correlation, or because there are two ways to solve the problem of
   foraging in exposed areas: be very vigilant and rely on early detection
   coupled with speed to escape, or reduce vigilance to minimize time spent
   in an exposed location. Both strategies seem to be equally successful,
   and this `locomotor ability-wariness' syndrome may therefore allow slow
   animals to compensate behaviourally for their impaired locomotor
   ability.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often consistently differ in personalities and behaviours
   that allow them to cope with environmental variation. Flight initiation
   distance (FID) has been measured in a variety of taxa as an estimate of
   the risk that an individual is willing to take when facing a predator.
   FID has been used to test life-history trade-offs related to
   anti-predatory behaviour and for conservation purposes such as to
   establish buffer zones to minimize human disturbance, given its
   species-specific consistency. Individual consistency in FID, however,
   has been largely overlooked. Here we show that, even after controlling
   for several confounding effects, this behaviour has a strong individual
   component (repeatability = 0.84-0.92) in a bird species, leaving a small
   margin for behavioural flexibility. We hypothesize that individuals may
   distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their individual
   susceptibility to human disturbance. This habitat selection hypothesis
   merits further research, given its implications on both evolutionary and
   applied ecology research. For example, selection of human-tolerant
   phenotypes may be promoted through the humanization of habitats
   occurring worldwide, and when population means instead of individual
   variability in FID are considered for designing buffer zones to reduce

Abstract = {{One function of aggression in animals is to gain access to mates.
   Aggression may therefore be favoured by sexual selection, the strength

   Here, we tested the hypotheses that male swordtails, Xiphophorus sp.,
   are consistent in the aggressive and mating behaviours exhibited and in
   the time spent at a close distance to females (female attendance), and
   that aggressive males gain increased opportunity to attempt copulation
   compared to their less aggressive conspecifics (sneak frequency). As
   predicted, aggression between males, and male display and sneak
   frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not
   significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The function of
   aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect
   female access function through formation of dominance hierarchies or
   defence of resources. A surprising finding highlighted by this study was
   the contradictory results for consistency in female contact, with high

Abstract = {{To investigate the ecological significance of personality, researchers
   generally measure behavioural traits in captivity. Whether behaviour in
   captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom
   tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild
   in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were
   briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and
   neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then
   released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an
   electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of
   feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery
   of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild.
   At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia
   in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was
   independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or
   weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual
   exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in
   captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all
   constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or
   the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in
   contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia
   measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured
   in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities,
   personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in
   foraging behaviour between individuals. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food

   androstenedione) in the eggs. The birds were housed in; common-garden

   suitable tests that could be used to measure the sociability of

   as a ``gold standard{''} test of social motivation and was repeated
   three times on 46 focal cows. In the runway test, the average latency to
   reach 5 m and 2 m from the herd and the time spent in these areas were
   recorded and analysed for repeatability. Latency to reach the 5 m line
   over the three tests was the most repeatable variable (0.54) and was
   taken as a measure of social motivation against which to assess other
   measures of sociability shown by the cows in their home-pen. The
   home-pen measures were the distance of each cow to the two nearest
   neighbours, location of the cow in the cow shed, and the level of
   synchrony based on individual behaviour of each focal cow compared with
   the rest of the herd's behaviour. Cows that had high latencies to reach

   whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across
   temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the
   individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality.
   In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature
   contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended
   to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the
   importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying

Abstract = {{Despite considerable support for the inter-rater reliability of the Hare
   Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 1991, 2003) in research
   contexts, there is increasing concern that scores from this instrument
   may be considerably less stable across examiners in applied contexts,
   particularly when scoring is based on separate interviews. The present
   study examines archival data from a sample of imprisoned sex offenders
   (n=20) who obtained relatively high PCL-R total scores (>= 25) and were
   administered this instrument on a second occasion by a different
   examiner. Intraclass correlations for the total and Factor 2 score were
   lower than those generally reported in research studies. Of greater
   concern, Factor 1 scores were only negligibly related to each other
   (ICC(A,1) = .16). Correcting for potential range restriction among these
   high scoring individuals resulted in total and Factor 2 score measures
   of agreement that were somewhat more consistent with published research,
   but Factor 1 continued to display exceedingly poor agreement across
   examiners. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{367-382}},
Abstract = {{The lifecycles of parasites are often complex, with multiple successive
   hosts. Many parasites have evolved the ability to modify the behaviour
   of their present host to increase the chance of transmission to the next
   host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related
   behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic
   manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two
   trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the
   behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a
   behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the
   correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural
   traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted:
   phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical
   distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect
   on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods
   infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly,
   amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural
   correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts.
   Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected
   amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these
   results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome
   framework.}},

Volume = {{420}},
Pages = {{273-276}},
Abstract = {{The extent and importance of consistent individual differences in
   behaviour, often referred to as `personality' or `temperament', is a
   relatively recent question in ecology. It indicates that animal
   behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that
   individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to
   changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a
   wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but
   there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine
   fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural
   traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P.
   unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in
   boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but
   average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A
   correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder
   individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of
   personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as
   sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality
   and life-history traits that affect fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of yolk androgens can vary among females as well as within

   conditions. Testosterone was analysed in three eggs collected per female
   at the beginning, top and the end of a reproductive period and the
   extent of inter- and intra-female differences in yolk deposition of this
   androgen was quantified. Yolk testosterone concentrations and the yolk
   testosterone content decreased from the early to the latest stage of

Abstract = {{P> Temperament traits increasingly provide a focus for investigating the
   evolutionary ecology of behavioural variation. Here, we examine the
   underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in
   the temperament trait `exploration behaviour in a novel environment'
   (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a
   passerine bird, the great tit Parus major.
   First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a
   restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term
   pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only
   moderately heritable and permanent environment (V(PE)) effects
   contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects.
   We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various
   temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive
   success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting
   on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment,
   but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no
   evidence of any selection on EB through survival.
   Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst
   males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients -
   local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any
   previous equivalent demonstrations.
   All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration
   behaviour (EB(2), measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate
   comparison with other studies. EB and EB(2) were strongly correlated to
   one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at
   the phenotypic level and V(PE) was undetected in EB(2). Selection on
   EB(2) was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are
   broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective.
   Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait
   `exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this
   population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident
   along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong V(PE) effect
   detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of
   variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an
   environmental context.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study tests the two main characteristics of a temperament trait,
   consistency across time and consistency across situations. The
   temperament trait of interest was aggressiveness during feeding in dairy
   cattle. In this study, we focused on whether it is possible to infer a
   trait of aggressiveness from the measurement of behavioural responses
   expressed by individual cows during feeding. Aggressive behaviour
   appears in many contexts but this paper focuses on aggressive behaviour
   in a competitive situation over a feed resource in housed dairy cattle.
   It is important that we fully understand within-cow consistency of
   aggressiveness in different competitive and social situations. To
   achieve this the following questions were investigated: (1) are cows
   consistent in how they express aggressive behaviour over time? (2) and
   across situations at a standard and reduced (competitive) feedface? The
   aim of this study was to measure the behavioural reactions of housed
   dairy cattle during feeding in a way that can be practically and easily
   recorded on commercial farms. Ten primiparous and 30 multiparous healthy
   lactating cows were housed in a group (parity = 3.5 +/- 2.15; mean +/-
   S.D.). The behaviour of the aggressor and recipient was recorded for
   each aggressive interaction for 60 min after feed arrival. Repeatability
   estimates and Kendall's coefficient of concordance were both used to
   assess consistency of aggressor and recipient behaviours across time.
   The within-cow repeatability was highest for `aggressive index' (r=0.31)
   and lowest for non-response behaviours (r=0.04) across time.
   Individual's responses to the standard and reduced feedface were
   significantly correlated for contact and non-contact behaviours. These
   results highlight the complexity of aggressive style of cows during
   feeding and illustrate that some measures of aggressive feeding
   behaviour are repeatable within cows. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. - Social functioning is a primordial aspect of mental health
   and it should be considered as an important outcome measure in
   psychiatric treatments and studies. Few short and simple assessment
   instruments are available in French. Recently, the Questionnaire de
   Fonctionnement Social (QFS) was developed to study social behavior of
   psychiatric patients. The QFS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire
   assessing the frequency of and the satisfaction with social behavior
   during the last two weeks. The aim of the present study is to explore
   QFS psychometric properties in a sample of patients with borderline
   personality disorder.
   Methods. - Eighty-six outpatients (78 women and eight men, mean age:
   30.5 +/- 8.6) with borderline personality disorder and 100 healthy
   matched control subjects (89 women and 11 men, mean age: 30.2 +/- 7.7)
   completed the QFS. The convergent and divergent validities of the QFS
   were tested with the following instruments: Social Adaptation
   Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and a visual
   scale of suffering (EVS). Test-retest reliability of the QFS was
   calculated in a sub-sample of 28 subjects and its sensitivity to change
   was measured for 45 patients.
   Results. - Internal consistency of the QFS' global index was satisfying
   (Cronbach alpha from 0.59 to 0.84). Test-retest reliability of the QFS
   indexes ranged from 0.77 to 0.79 (intraclass correlation coefficient).
   Correlations between QFS and SASS demonstrated moderate convergent
   validity (r > 0.59) whilst associations with others psychological
   measures (BSI, BDI, BHS, EVS) showed satisfying divergent validity
   (-0.42 < r < -0.12). Discriminate validity was excellent as the group of
   healthy control subjects scored significantly higher than the group of
   patients in all variables (Mann-Whitney all p < 0.001). QFS sensitivity
   to change after psychotherapeutic treatment was good as shown by the
   significant change observed in Frequency and Satisfaction index
   (Wilcoxon respectively p = 0.002 and p < 0.001).
   Conclusion. - The QFS demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in
   the studied population. This study confirms it is a valuable tool. to
   assess social functioning of borderline personality disorder patients.

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Many behaviours cannot be performed simultaneously, which forces animals
   to decide which behaviour to perform. In a behavioural trade-off,
   individuals should act as if they have weighed these alternatives before
   acting. Because the costs and benefits of performing specific behaviours
   are likely to differ between individuals as a result of different
   environmental and/or genetic backgrounds, individuals should vary in the
   decisions they make. Male threespine stickleback establish territories
   and nest close to one another; thus, they may be faced with a decision:
   fight a potential rival male or court a female. To assess how males
   respond to the presence of conflicting stimuli, males were presented
   with a dummy female alone, a dummy male alone, a dummy male and a dummy
   female simultaneously, and two dummy females simultaneously.
   Repeatability scores indicated that individuals were consistent in their
   responses to a given stimulus within a treatment yet differed from one
   another in their responses. For example, some males were more vigorous
   courters than others. In the female-male treatment, some males focused
   on only one of the stimuli while others divided their time between the
   two. This finding suggests that males may use different strategies when
   conflicting stimuli are present. Few studies have empirically examined
   the choices that territorial males make when these competing options are
   presented simultaneously, even though this situation is probably common
   in the wild. This study provides insight into male decision making when
   stimuli that elicit mutually incompatible behaviours are present and
   suggests that there may be a genetic basis to these differences. (C)

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that
   behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and
   context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among
   individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that
   some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship
   between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured
   several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese,
   Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of
   individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to
   an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a
   leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in
   pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability
   for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly
   correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity
   or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that
   leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality.
   Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected
   not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by
   the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that
   movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the
   personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement
   patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types
   present in the group. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{The social fine structure of a population plays a central role in
   ecological and evolutionary processes. Whilst many studies have
   investigated how morphological traits such as size affect social
   structure of populations, comparatively little is known about the
   influence of behaviours such as boldness and shyness. Using information
   on social interactions in a wild population of Trinidadian guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata), we construct a social network. For each
   individual in the network, we quantify its behavioural phenotype using
   two measures of boldness, predator inspection tendency, a repeatable and
   reliably measured behaviour well studied in the context of co-operation,
   and shoaling tendency. We observe striking heterogeneity in contact
   patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties
   negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy
   fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on
   average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly
   influenced by behavioural trait. We assert that such structure will have
   implications for the outcome of selection on behavioural traits and we
   speculate that the observed positive assortment may act as an amplifier
   of selection contributing to the maintenance of co-operation during
   predator inspection.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the causes and correlates of natural variation in gene
   expression in healthy populations assumes that individual differences in
   gene expression can be reliably and stably assessed across time.
   However, this is yet to be established. We examined 4-hour test-retest
   reliability and 10 month test-retest stability of individual differences
   in gene expression in ten 12-year-old children. Blood was collected on
   four occasions: 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Day 1 and 10 months later at 10
   a.m. and 2 p.m. Total RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix-U133 plus 2.0
   arrays. For each probeset, the correlation across individuals between 10
   a.m. and 2 p.m. on Day 1 estimates test-retest reliability. We
   identified 3,414 variable and abundantly expressed probesets whose
   4-hour test-retest reliability exceeded .70, a conventionally accepted
   level of reliability, which we had 80\% power to detect. Of the 3,414
   reliable probesets, 1,752 were also significantly reliable 10 months
   later. We assessed the long-term stability of individual differences in
   gene expression by correlating the average expression level for each
   probe-set across the two 4-hour assessments on Day 1 with the average
   level of each probe-set across the two 4-hour assessments 10 months
   later. 1,291 (73.7\%) of the 1,752 probe-sets that reliably detected
   individual differences across 4 hours on two occasions, 10 months apart,
   also stably detected individual differences across 10 months.
   Heritability, as estimated from the MZ twin intraclass correlations, is
   twice as high for the 1,752 reliable probesets versus all present
   probesets on the array (0.68 vs 0.34), and is even higher (0.76) for the
   1,291 reliable probesets that are also stable across 10 months. The
   1,291 probesets that reliably detect individual differences from a
   single peripheral blood collection and stably detect individual
   differences over 10 months are promising targets for research on the
   causes (e.g., eQTLs) and correlates (e.g., psychopathology) of
   individual differences in gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Suites of correlated behaviors, or ``behavioral syndromes,{''} have been
   shown to occur throughout the animal kingdom. Behavioral syndromes
   involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary
   ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to
   sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches
   (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice,
   and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified
   between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression
   directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an
   opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals
   exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction.
   Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior
   in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In
   contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing
   cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context.
   Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call
   ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between
   courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship
   directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context.
   Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive
   success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual
   selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context,
   may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are thought to adjust their behavior optimally to any given

   (244 females with 482 breeding attempts) breeding in a highly variable
   environment created by fluctuations in the abundance of their main prey
   (field and bank voles) across years. Ural owls were more aggressive when
   voles were increasing in density as well as when the Ural owls had large
   brood sizes and laid early in the season. Aggressive nest defense was
   highly repeatable between breeding attempts (r = 0.52 +/- 0.05 standard

   which they adjusted the level of their aggression to the varying food
   conditions). Fierce nest defenders produced more recruits to the local

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, defined as consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioral traits, are suggested to be common in the
   animal kingdom and can have important fitness consequences. Individual
   differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be
   part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect
   an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such
   environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study
   because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental
   sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration
   behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species.
   Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that
   individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the
   parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile
   wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was
   measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of
   exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly
   predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding
   exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings,
   behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better
   predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the
   relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be
   easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to
   exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity
   correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further
   highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic
   plasticity in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately evaluating and selecting for calm temperament in beef cattle
   is important for economic and animal welfare reasons. Previous studies
   have shown that eye white (EW) can be a predictor of a multitude of
   emotions across different situations, but there is little research on
   the relationship between EW and temperament. The objective of this
   experiment was to assess the accuracy and reliability of using the
   percentage of exposed EW as a predictor of temperament in beef cattle.
   Forty-eight heifers (group 1), 39 bulls (group 2), and 60 steers (group
   3) were video-recorded while in a squeeze chute, and 2 still digital
   images from each animal were selected for EW determination. Chute
   temperament scores were assigned: 1 (calm) to 5 (agitated). Flight
   speeds were measured blindly and independently during a subsequent test
   in which the amount of time it took a solitary animal to pass a handler
   and travel a specified distance was recorded. The EW area in each image
   was measured using Sigmascan Pro 5 and was expressed as the percentage
   of exposed eye area. Each image was analyzed twice to determine tracing
   repeatability. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among 2
   images of the same animal, as well as among duplicate readings of the
   same image to determine animal and tracing repeatabilities. The mean
   percentages of EW were 30.14 +/- 14.37, 31.43 +/- 14.77, and 28.57 +/-
   12.38, and the average percentage accuracy for duplicate image EW
   measures was 96, 96, and 93 (P < 0.0001) for groups 1, 2, and 3,
   respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for EW percentage and
   chute temperament scores were 0.674 (P < 0.0001), 0.95 (P < 0.0001), and
   0.696 (P < 0.0001), whereas the correlations between EW and flight
   speeds were 0.415 (P < 0.0001), 0.333 (P < 0.05), and 0.294 (P < 0.01)
   for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Results from this study indicate
   that percentage EW in cattle could be used as a quantitative tool with
   minimal equipment to assess temperament in beef cattle, providing an

Abstract = {{Despite burgeoning interest in consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (animal `personality'), the influence of social interactions
   on the performance of different behavioural types is poorly understood.
   Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality
   differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the
   possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit
   personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received
   serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing
   selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch,
   we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration)
   between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts,
   the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex
   companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to
   behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of
   individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more
   exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory
   tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently
   across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though
   individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory
   behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion,
   the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of
   exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also
   affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results
   stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and
   of considering the influence of social context in animal personality
   studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of
   the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in individual differences in animal

   factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use
   meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more

Abstract = {{If variation in behaviour is consistent within individuals and reliably
   associated with relevant welfare measures, this variation could aid in
   genetic selection, or development of management schemes designed to
   improve welfare. In this study, we focused on temperament tests in
   group-housed finishing pigs, with the objective of validating measures
   that are readily applicable in commercial settings and potentially
   related to individual differences in stress response. A total of 118
   pigs in two replicate studies were housed in pens of 7-8 pigs per pen.
   At 24 weeks of age, animals were subjected to three tests of fear in the
   home pen: the human approach test (HAT), novel object test (NOT) and
   open door test(ODT). In each test, pigs were scored on their latency to
   contact the human or object, or to leave the home pen. Tests were
   repeated on three occasions at intervals of 3-4 days. On each test day
   the HAT was performed twice to compare results between different
   handlers. Behaviour in tests of fear was compared with two social tests
   in a subset of 58 pigs. Lesion scoring was performed after mixing as a
   measure of aggression, and a feed competition test was used to assess
   social status. Repeatability within-test was evaluated in a mixed model
   with pig as a random effect, and agreement between days, handlers and
   tests was evaluated by partial correlations after controlling for
   replicate, pen and day effects. Latency to perform all three fear tests
   decreased significantly over time. Correlations within-test showed
   significant agreement between all days for HAT and ODT, and between HAT
   handlers. Between tests, the HAT and ODT were correlated, and ODT and
   NOT tended to correlate. Comparisons between group fear tests and social
   tests showed that pigs which readily approach a human tended to have
   higher lesion scores and fewer feeding bouts in the feed competition
   trial. While test latencies decrease with repetition, the HAT and ODT
   show individual consistency over time, which suggests that these tests
   describe behavioural tendencies and may be useful for predicting fearful
   responses at slaughter. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. The response of dispersal towards evolution largely depends on its

   3. Ballooning motivation can be regarded as highly individual-specific

Abstract = {{Interest in personality is growing in a wide range of disciplines, but
   only in a few systems it is possible to assess the survival value of
   personality. Field studies looking at the relationship between
   personality and survival value early in life are greatly hampered by the
   fact that personality can at present only be assessed after individuals
   become independent from their parents. In passerines, for example, this
   is often after a period of intensive selection for the survival on
   fledglings. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop a method
   to measure personality before this period of selection. For this
   purpose, we developed the handling stress (HS) test. We measured HS in
   14-d-old great tit nestlings by counting the number of breast movements
   (breath rate) in four subsequent 15-s bouts for 1 min; before and after
   they were socially isolated from their siblings for 15 min. To calculate
   the repeatability of HS, we repeated the test 6 mo later. To assess the
   relationship between HS and exploratory behaviour, we correlated the
   outcome of both tests. We ran tests both on birds of lines selected for
   extreme personality and on wild birds from a natural population. We
   found that birds selected for fast exploration reacted more to HS
   compared with birds selected for slow exploration and that HS was
   repeatable in different life phases. We confirmed this by finding an
   increase in the HS with increasing exploratory scores in wild birds.
   These results show that we can use the HS test as a measurement of
   personality, making it a potential tool for studying the relationship
   between personality and survival value early in life.}},

Abstract = {{Social foragers can alternate between searching for food (producer
   tactic), and searching for other individuals that have located food in
   order to join them (scrounger tactic). Both tactics yield equal rewards
   on average, but the rewards generated by producer are more variable. A
   dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers
   should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy
   requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging
   period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy
   requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with
   differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female
   zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic
   variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater
   use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However,
   we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating
   that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our
   experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that
   variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in
   foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives: The activity of behavioral inhibition and
   activation systems (BIS and BAS) has been related to several mental
   disorders. The availability of a validated questionnaire to assess BIS
   and BAS over the telephone could aid research. The objective of the
   present study was to evaluate the procedural validity of telephone
   administration of the sensitivity to punishment/sensitivity to reward
   questionnaire (SPSRQ) as a measure of BIS and BAS activity (by means of
   its two scales: the sensitivity to punishment {[}SP] scale and the
   sensitivity to reward {[}SR] scale).
   Methods: A total of 231 participants were assessed with the SPSRQ twice
   (over the telephone and in a self-administered format). Intraclass
   correlation coefficients and kappa indices were calculated.
   Additionally, possible differences between the mean scores obtained with
   the two assessment procedures and internal consistency were explored.
   Results: Telephone and self-assessment of BIS and BAS, by means of the
   SPSRQ, provided similar results, supporting the procedural validity of
   telephone administration. A slight but statistically significant
   tendency (estimated betha = 0.62; 95\% Cl, 0.33-0.92; p < 0.001) toward
   lower scores was observed for the telephone-administered SP scale and
   for the interaction ``first or second assessment/telephone or
   self-administered SPSRQ{''} for the SR scale (p = 0.023).
   Conclusions: The results of the present study support the reliability of
   telephone assessment of BIS and BAS by means of the SPSRQ. (C) 2008

Title = {{Reliability of an avoidance distance test for the assessment of animals'

Abstract = {{In many farm animal species, the relationship to humans affects their
   welfare considerably. But until now, on-farm studies on fattening bulls
   have been limited. A feasible, reliable methodology for assessing
   responses of bulls to humans Would be helpful for large scale surveys on
   this topic. Measuring avoidance distance at the feeding place (ADF) to
   assess animals' relationship to humans was shown to be a feasible and
   stable measure in dairy cow herds. So, the main objective of this study
   was to investigate reliability aspects of measuring avoidance distance
   at the feeding place towards an unknown experimenter on bull fattening
   farms. Moreover, we were interested in the potential confounding factor
   age of animals, and, on a preliminary level, a possible relationship of
   responsiveness of bulls to farmers' attitudes. With regard to
   reliability, between-experimenter repeatability - the repeatability of
   ADF when carried out by different experimenters within short time - was
   evaluated by two experimenters in a balanced order with 602 fattening
   bulls on 10 farms. The experimenter was both the stimulus person and the
   person collecting the data. Between-experimenter repeatability was
   analysed at an individual and at farm level. We recorded the median and
   mean values of avoidance distances {[}ADF median, ADF mean] per farm and
   the percentages of bulls accepting to be touched {[}ADF \% touch] or
   showing avoidance distances greater than 20 cm {[}ADF \% > 0.2 m].
   Inter-observer reliability, based on individual observations recorded by
   an experimenter and an observer simultaneously, was tested on six farms.
   Farmers were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess their
   attitudes (behavioural beliefs and affective attitudes) towards
   interacting with bulls.
   Generally, inter-observer reliability for ADF was high (r(s) > 0.9, n =
   288/297). At an individual level, moderate between-experimenter
   repeatability could be attained (r(s) = 0.6, n = 469). At farm level (n
   = 10), Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)) for
   between-experimenter repeatability ranged from >0.4 to 0.7. A low
   negative correlation was found between ADF and age at an individual
   level (r(s) = -0.14, P = 0.015, n = 320). Despite the rather low range
   of avoidance distances observed between farms, ADF correlated
   significantly with some of the farmers' attitudes. ADF was lower in case
   of farmers expressing more positive affective attitudes towards contacts
   with the animals (significantly so for the measures ADF mean and ADF \%
   > 0.2 m {[}P < 0.05]).
   In conclusion, the use of the avoidance distance test at the feeding
   place (ADF) is promising for assessing the responses of fattening bulls
   to humans due to its feasibility, reliability and sensitivity both at an
   individual and at farm level. Based on a limited number of farms, our
   first exploration of the relationships between farmers' attitudes and
   responses of bulls to humans in the home environment suggests possible
   links that require further investigations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, evidence for interindividual variation in
   ``personality{''} within animal populations has been accumulating.
   Personality is defined as consistency in an individual's behavioral
   responses over time and/or across situations. One personality trait that
   has potentially far-reaching implications for behavioral ecology, and
   may provide insight into the mechanisms by which consistent behavioral
   correlations arise, is that of boldness. Boldness is defined as the
   tendency of an individual to take risks and be exploratory in novel
   contexts. Using the framework of behavioral syndromes, we tested for
   individual differences in boldness in the laboratory among field-caught
   juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) within and across the
   contexts of exploratory behavior, activity, and risk taking (e.g.,
   antipredator) behavior. After such testing, individuals were tagged and
   returned to their lake of origin as part of a mark-recapture study
   testing for the repeatability of individual differences in boldness.
   Here, we report strong and consistent individual differences in boldness
   within and across all 3 behavioral contexts. Additionally, we observed
   that at least some boldness behaviors were repeatable after a 1-3 month
   recapture period. This study provides novel evidence for a boldness
   syndrome in sunfish, as well as insight into how behavioral types (e.g.,
   shy/bold) may evolve and be maintained in natural populations.}},

   (3) predicted nest success. We also predicted that (4) intensity of
   defense would increase with age and number of young, but decline over
   the breeding season. Intensity of nest defense was significantly
   repeatable for male kingbirds. Male response was twice as strong as
   female response during incubation and the nestling period, but nest
   success was independent of defense scores of males and females. Simple
   paired comparisons suggested leniale responses did not change between
   incubation and the nestling period, whereas males tended to defend
   nestlings more vigorously than eggs. Multivariate analyses demonstrated
   strong individual differences were the main source of variation in nest
   defense. Intensity of nest defense by males and females increased with
   age of young, declined seasonally, but was not related to number of

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context,
   such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and
   potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it
   has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from
   the social environment will provide a major source of heritable
   variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little
   empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an
   experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using
   quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find
   repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal
   individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the
   traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated
   correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were
   high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal
   individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a
   correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause
   the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the
   phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between
   direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss
   important components of heritable variation, and show that a full
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration
   of the genetic component of the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated intra-test and inter-test consistency of dairy
   cattle behavioural responses to a series of tests involving human
   approach and exposure to novelty. Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian
   cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel
   stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter
   approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP),
   lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was
   repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability
   estimates were 0,65,0.40,0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively.
   Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by
   comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate
   consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach
   tests (W(35) - 0.56, P < 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray,
   striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to
   each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were
   assessed. Cows showed the greatest reactivity response to the water
   spray compared to the striped boards (U(1) - 56, P < 0.001) and flashing
   light (U(1) - 66, P < 0.001). No statistically significant agreement
   existed between the novel stimuli reactivity and investigatory responses

   consistency between human approach situations was shown, however,
   consistency between human and novel situations was not found. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Behavioural problems in dogs are it major cause for their relinquishment
   and return to animal shelters and rehoming centres. It is important that
   the staff in these welfare centres can reliably assess the behavioural
   characteristics of the dogs so that they can be rehomed to the most
   appropriate environment and the owners can be made aware of what to
   expect. There have been very few studies which have assessed the
   reliability of the assessment of dogs' behavioural responses; therefore
   this study was conducted to assess the inter-rater reproducibility and
   intra-rater repeatability of the assessment of behavioural responses of
   dogs by staff at a UK dog welfare charity.
   Forty members of staff at Dogs Trust, a UK dog welfare charity, were
   asked to assess 20 dogs based on the dogs' behaviour recorded on video.
   They were then asked to repeat these assessments 2 months after they had
   completed the first assessments using the same video. The data were then
   analysed for inter-rater reproducibility and intra-rater repeatability
   using the weighted kappa statistic. It wits found that there was a
   moderate level of agreement between staff in their assessment of the
   dogs' behavioural responses to a person `approaching their kennel' and a
   poor to moderate level of agreement for behavioural responses to
   `general handling and grooming'. Additionally, there was only a
   low-level of agreement for many of the responses to a dog `meeting
   another dog' and this may have been due to the small number of dogs that
   were able to be assessed in this situation. The inter-rater
   reproducibility was greater when the analysis was restricted to those
   members of staff who had formal training or more than 8 years of
   experience. The intra-rater repeatability was generally moderate to high
   in all cases indicating it good consistency by members of staff over
   time.
   The current study shows that there is an overall moderate level of
   agreement amongst staff but as they gain experience and training their
   level of agreement tends to increase. This study also highlighted the
   need for the standardisation of the assessments currently used. It is
   important that staff are able to consistently identify behavioural
   characteristics of dogs in order to provide the best chance of a
   successful adoption. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of many species differ consistently in their behavioral
   reactions toward different stimuli, such as predators, rivals, and
   potential mates. These typical reactions, described as `behavioral
   syndromes' or `personalities,' appear to be heritable and therefore
   subject to selection. We studied behavioral syndromes in 36 male fowl
   living in 12 social groups and found that individuals behaved
   consistently over time. Furthermore, responses to different contexts
   (anti-predator, foraging, and territorial) were inter-correlated,
   suggesting that males exhibited comparable behavioral traits in these
   functionally distinct situations. We subsequently isolated the same
   roosters and conducted tests in a `virtual environment,' using
   high-resolution digital video sequences to simulate the anti-predator,
   foraging, and territorial contexts that they had experienced outdoors.
   Under these controlled conditions, repeatability persisted but
   individual responses to the three classes of stimuli failed to predict
   one another. These were instead context-specific. In particular,
   production of each type of vocal signal was independent, implying that
   calls in the repertoire are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Our
   results show that extrinsic factors, such as social position, can be
   responsible for the appearance of traits that could readily be mistaken
   for the product of endogenous characters.}},

Title = {{Intraspecific divergence in sperm morphology of the green sea urchin,
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis: implications for selection in
   broadcast spawners}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sperm morphology can be highly variable among species, but
   less is known about patterns of population differentiation within
   species. Most studies of sperm morphometric variation are done in
   species with internal fertilization, where sexual selection can be
   mediated by complex mating behavior and the environment of the female
   reproductive tract. Far less is known about patterns of sperm evolution
   in broadcast spawners, where reproductive dynamics are largely carried
   out at the gametic level. We investigated variation in sperm morphology
   of a broadcast spawner, the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus
   droebachiensis), within and among spawnings of an individual, among
   individuals within a population, and among populations. We also examined
   population-level variation between two reproductive seasons for one
   population. We then compared among-population quantitative genetic
   divergence (Q(ST)) for sperm characters to divergence at neutral
   microsatellite markers (F(ST)).
   Results: All sperm traits except total length showed strong patterns of
   high diversity among populations, as did overall sperm morphology
   quantified using multivariate analysis. We also found significant
   differences in almost all traits among individuals in all populations.
   Head length, axoneme length, and total length had high within-male
   repeatability across multiple spawnings. Only sperm head width had
   significant within-population variation across two reproductive seasons.
   We found signatures of directional selection on head length and head
   width, with strong selection possibly acting on head length between the
   Pacific and West Atlantic populations. We also discuss the strengths and
   limitations of the Q(ST)-F(ST) comparison.
   Conclusion: Sperm morphology in S. droebachiensis is highly variable,
   both among populations and among individuals within populations, and has
   low variation within an individual across multiple spawnings. Selective
   pressures acting among populations may differ from those acting within,
   with directional selection implicated in driving divergence among
   populations and balancing selection as a possible mechanism for
   producing variability among males. Sexual selection in broadcast
   spawners may be mediated by different processes from those acting on
   internal fertilizers. Selective divergence in sperm head length among
   populations is associated with ecological differences among populations
   that may play a large role in mediating sexual selection in this
   broadcast spawner.}},

   and the whole stimulus array. Behavioral differences between strains
   were predominantly due to variation in a single phenotypic parameter:
   their overall responsiveness toward optimal and suboptimal olfactory
   stimuli. These differences were not explained by variation in olfactory
   sensitivity, locomotory activity, or general vigor monitored by
   survival. Comparisons with three recently established wild-type strains
   indicated that a high behavioral threshold against accepting suboptimal
   olfactory stimuli is the characteristic phenotype of wild D.

Abstract = {{Although individual variation is a key requirement for natural
   selection, little is known about the magnitude and patterns of
   individual variation in endocrine systems or the functional significance
   of that variation. Here we describe (1) the extent and repeatability of
   inter-individual variation in adrenocortical responses and (2) its
   relationship to sex-specific phenotypic quality, such as song duration
   and frequency and timing of egg laying. We measured adrenocortical
   responses to a standardized stressor in zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata) at two life history stages: similar to day 16 (nestlings) and 3
   months of age (sexually mature adults). Subsequently, we assessed
   phenotypic (reproductive) quality of all individuals as adults. Marked
   inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical response was seen in
   both sexes and ages, e.g., stress-induced corticosterone ranged from 2.2
   to 62.5 ng/mL in nestlings and 5.0-64.0 ng/mL in adults. We found sex
   differences in (a) inter-individual variation in the adrenocortical
   response, (b) repeatability, and (c) relationships between
   corticosterone levels and phenotypic quality. In males, variation in
   nestling corticosterone was weakly but positively correlated with brood
   size and negatively correlated with nestling mass (though this
   relationship was dependent on one individual). There was no significant
   correlation of adrenocortical responses between two stages in males and
   adult phenotypic quality was significantly correlated only with adult
   corticosterone levels. In contrast, in females there was no relationship
   between nestling corticosterone and brood size or mass but
   adrenocortical response was repeatable between two stages (r(2) =0.413).

Abstract = {{Structures built by animals may convey useful information about the
   builder that may be used by conspecifics in quality assessment. In fish,
   nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual
   builders, but little is known about how consistent individual
   differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect
   builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals
   in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male
   three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the
   repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from
   four populations in mid-Wales, U.K., to complete three consecutive nests
   under standardized laboratory conditions. We quantified a number of
   structural components and design characteristics of nests and estimated
   repeatability (r) of these traits. Within populations, the number of
   threads used, the area of the nest and the mass of substrate deposited
   on top of the nest were all repeatable within males (0.39 < r < 0.51),
   showing that individual male three-spined sticklebacks differed
   consistently in the size and composition of the nests they produced. Our
   data support the hypothesis that nest characteristics may reveal
   important information about the quality of individual males, and that
   they may, at least in part, be under genetic control. We discuss these
   findings in the context of the evolution of nest characteristics in
   sticklebacks and other species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Brief screening instruments for co-morbid personality
   disorders could potentially have great value in substance abuse
   treatment settings.
   Methods: We assessed the psychometric properties of the 8-item
   Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS) in a
   sample of 58 methadone maintenance patients.
   Results: Internal consistency was modest, but similar to the original
   value (alpha = 0.62), and test-retest correlation at four months
   follow-up was moderately encouraging for a short instrument such as this
   (n = 31, test retest intraclass correlation = 0.58), and change at the
   mean level was minimal, but marginally significant (from an average of
   3.3 to 3.8, p = 0.06). Analyses of nurse ratings of patients' behaviour
   at the clinic showed that SAPAS was significantly correlated with nurse
   ratings of externalizing behaviour (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), and Global
   Assessment of Functioning (r = -0.36, p = 0.006), but unrelated to
   intoxication (r = 0.02, NS), or withdrawal (r = 0.20, NS).
   Conclusion: There is evidence that the SAPAS is a modestly valid and
   relatively reliable brief screening measure of personality disorders in
   patients with ongoing substance abuse undergoing methadone maintenance.
   It can be used in situations where limited resources are available, and
   researchers or others wish to get an impression of the degree of

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies are focusing on the role of animal
   temperament in the ecology of wild populations. One important step in
   these studies is to estimate the repeatability of temperament traits, by
   replicating measures of an animal's behavioural or physiological
   reactions to a novel or stressful situation. When studies are performed
   in the field, several factors can affect repeatability estimates: (1)
   micro-environmental conditions prior to or during a test may affect the
   measured behaviour, and spatial heterogeneity in predation risk within
   the habitat of a population may affect repeatability; (2) a decrease
   over time in the strength of behavioural reactions as a result of
   habituation may bias repeatability; and (3) individuals may differ in
   their habituation. In this study we used a linear mixed-model approach
   to test for the occurrence of interindividual variation in behavioural
   reaction and habituation of eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, to a
   hole-board test and a handling bag test. We found high intraindividual
   consistency for the behaviours recorded both in the hole-board and
   handling bag tests; four temperament traits could be considered (i.e.
   activity/exploration, reaction to stress, emotionality and docility).
   Given that we found no phenotypic variation in habituation, chipmunks
   seem to show a behavioural carryover in activity/exploration and
   docility, which could have consequences for the evolutionary potential
   of habituation to novelty. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{MR elastography (MRE) enables the noninvasive determination of the

   strategy, multiple wave images corresponding to different driving
   frequencies are simultaneously received and can be analyzed by
   evaluating the dispersion of the complex modulus over frequency. The
   technique was applied on the brain and liver of five healthy volunteers.
   Its repeatability was tested by four followup studies in each volunteer.
   Five standard rheological models (Maxwell, Voigt, Zener, Jeffreys and
   fractional Zener model) were assessed for their ability to reproduce the

Abstract = {{Variation in sex ratio can affect mating behaviour, with more intense
   competition predicted at biased sex ratios. In species with alternative
   mating behaviours, sex ratio variation can induce switches between
   behaviour types and this, together with the consistency with which
   behaviours are expressed, may also affect the intensity of sexual
   selection. All these factors can be combined to elucidate individual
   mating behaviour profiles. The establishment of individual behavioural
   profiles for male mating behaviour in one species, the guppy, Poecilia
   reticulata, is the focus of this study; specifically, we ask whether
   individual male mating behaviour profiles show that males have
   consistent reproductive behaviour across contexts where the advantages
   of using alternative mating tactics differ. The frequency of both sneak
   mating and display behaviours varied between sex ratios. Male display
   and sneak frequency were highly repeatable and males maintained
   consistent rankings of behaviour under equal, male- and female-biased
   sex ratios. We conclude, therefore, that male guppies have individual
   mating behaviour profiles. The use of behavioural profiles fills a gap
   in the existing literature by allowing behaviours that are functionally
   related but not correlated, such as alternative mating behaviours, to be
   treated as an integrated unit. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Contrasting results of relations between standard metabolic rate,

   budget depend on environmental conditions. Here, we show how habitat
   complexity changes the relationship between standard metabolic rate,
   behaviour and performance (winter energy loss-rates) in juvenile
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).
   Juvenile Salmon, individually screened for standard metabolic rate, were
   stocked in replicated semi-natural stream channels with and without
   sheltering possibilities under ledge cover. We recorded the use of
   ledged areas, energy-loss rates and feeding activity during a 61-day
   period.
   In the channels with ledge cover, individuals with relatively higher
   standard metabolic rates used areas outside of the cover more frequently
   and had higher feeding frequency than individuals with lower standard
   metabolic rates. No relationship was apparent between areas used,
   feeding and standard metabolic rate for the individuals within the
   no-cover treatments. In channels without cover, there was a negative
   relationship between standard metabolic rate and performance (energy
   balance), whereas standard metabolic rate did not affect performance in
   channels with ledge cover.
   The effect of standard metabolic rate on performance depended on habitat
   complexity expressed through differences in behaviour. In channels with
   ledge cover, individuals with higher standard metabolic rates were
   apparently able to compensate for higher metabolic costs by utilizing a
   riskier habitat outside the cover and attaining a higher feeding
   success.
   The present study demonstrates that the relationship between standard
   metabolic rate and performance may be dependent on habitat complexity
   and vary on small spatial scales, contributing to the persistence of
   large variation in standard metabolic rate within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Behavioural problems in adolescents are thought to be relevant as strong
   predictors for the detection of other psychological disorders. For this
   reason and due to the importance they present by themselves, carrying
   out an adequate assessment of them is fundamental. Mental health
   professionals have diverse opinions about the value and importance of
   the different informants. The majority choose of their sources according
   to the disorder and necessities of each evaluator. On the other hand,
   the need to obtain data about adolescents' functioning from multiple
   resources has been emphasised and numerous reasons have been exposed.
   Concretely, the fact of carrying out the most objective and complete
   evaluations as possible has been considered essential in those studies
   aimed at evaluating behavioural alteration in adolescents. For this
   reason, Achenbach developed three versions of his scale: one for the
   parents, another for the teachers and a third one for the adolescents
   themselves. Numerous investigations have studied the concordance between
   groups of informants about different behavioural alterations in
   adolescents, but none have carried out a complete analysis of all
   informants in all subscales (not only the total ones). For this reason,
   the current study has been developed with the aim of contributing to
   obtain an enriching vision for the professional in the field.
   Objectives
   a) To systematically explore agreement patterns between adolescents,
   teachers and parents who inform of behavioural problems in adolescents
   in the general population and b) in those cases in which no agreement is
   found, to analyse the level of disagreement between each pair of
   informants for each subscale.
   Methodology
   Cross-sectional and descriptive study.
   Participants. The study was formed by 160 triads of parents, teachers
   and 13-16 year old adolescents selected from several schools in
   Barcelona.
   Instruments. The three forms of the Achenbach scale behavioural
   alterations were applied, The scale was translated into Spanish by the
   Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnostic in Psychopathology of the
   Development of the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona: Youth Self-Report,
   self-evaluated, Child Behaviour Checklist/4-18 and Teacher's Report
   Form, both heteroevaluated and completed by parents and teachers,
   respectively. These three forms contain a 89-item set that evaluates the
   same behaviour, where eight items are organised in scales of syndromes
   derived empirically and which are invariant throughout informants. The
   eight subscales are: withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed,
   social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent
   behaviour and aggressive behaviour. Some of them are grouped in second
   order factors: the first three in internalising, the last two in
   externalising, and the rest of them provide a total problems
   punctuation.
   Statistical procedure. Agreement values were analysed for each pair of
   informants and each subscale through the Intraclass Correlation
   Coefficient (ICC). A value below 0.40 indicates low concordance. In
   these cases, the statistical analysis proceeds with the discordance
   analysis by pairs of informants and for each subscale through the Bland
   Altman Method.
   Results A low concordance (below 0.40) between informants was found
   especially in internalizing scales (0.230). A slightly higher value was
   found in attention (0.334), aggressive behaviour (0.371), externalizing
   (0.357), and total subscales (0.327). Secondly, it was observed that,
   when informing about somatic complains, thought and attention problems,
   internalising items and the total scale, parents reported more
   alterations, followed by adolescents and teachers. Also, parents
   indicated more withdrawal problems in adolescents, although in this case
   they were followed by teachers and adolescents themselves. Finally, in
   the evaluation of the anxiety/depression scales, social problems,
   delinquent behaviour, aggressiveness and externalising conducts,
   adolescents informed of more alterations followed by their parents, and
   then by the teachers. Regarding the agreement/disagreement variability
   throughout the scales scores, the discordance between different
   informants was higher when the punctuation was further away from
   normality, generally when the scales were scored higher.
   Discussion
   The normative criteria of comparison and the reference frames for each
   group of informants are different. For instance, the fact that teachers
   report less behavioural alterations could be explained because of their
   familiarity in dealing with adolescents and a higher tolerance towards
   some behaviors. In general terms, this result fits in with most
   conclusions from investigations carried out in this field. On the other
   hand, the fact that parents inform of more internalising problems could
   be attributed to adolescent behaviour which would in turn alter the
   family context. Another explanation might be that parents are on the
   whole more implicated and more sensitive in detecting certain conducts
   or behavioural alterations in their offspring. In any case, it is
   disputable whether the lack of concordance between the different
   informants does really exist or, on the contrary, adolescent behaviour
   changes depending on the context. Finally, a result contradicting those
   found in the studies reviewed is that adolescents are the ones who
   report more externalising problems. Other authors have found that
   adolescents inform more about internalising problems, something which
   should be expected taking into account that they are the ones who know
   themselves better. This could be possibly explained by the presence of
   more social desirability/undesirability among the adolescents of our
   sample in front of their pair group when answering to the evaluation
   scales; this may be due to the group context in which the case was
   applied. The main limitation of the present study that it was carried
   out with a general population sample, although from another point of
   view this may be considered as a gain of the study. We recommend
   carrying out explicative studies about discordance, which could clarify
   the predictive validity of each informant group and make variations in
   the type of sample under study.
   Conclusions
   Data from different sources contribute with specific information of
   relative validity. This is why a multidimensional, multisituational and
   mulitiinformant approach is fundamental. This is necessary not only to
   evaluate behavioural alterations in adolescents within a research
   context, but also when taking diagnostic decisions in a clinical
   context, because, depending on the chosen informant,the diagnostic
   criteria for one disorder or another might change. Also, our results
   imply that there may be an underdetection of behavioural problems in
   adolescents by the adults, which would result in a lower psychological
   demand than the necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation of the behaviour of racehorses is one of the major
   concerns for racehorse breeders. In this study, the heritabilities of
   behavioural responses to the inspections of conjunctiva, auscultation
   and blood sampling and the genetic correlations among them were
   estimated in the Thoroughbred racehorse. The estimation was done with
   Bayesian analysis with Gibbs sampling based on the univariate or
   bivariate threshold animal models. The behavioural responses were scored
   with four categories at the first entrance quarantine in Miho Training
   Center of Japan Racing Association from 1993 to 1995. The behavioural
   responses were treated as categorical or binary traits, with both
   showing similar results. The estimated heritabilities were in the range
   of 0.23-0.28, suggesting a genetic component in the variation on these
   traits. The estimated genetic correlations among the traits were very
   high (approximately 0.9), suggesting that these behavioural responses
   may be measures of the same trait. Because of the high genetic
   correlations, repeatability threshold model was applied assuming the
   responses to be a genetically identical trait measured with three
   different tests. The estimated heritabilities (approximately 0.23) were
   at the lower bound of the former estimates. The revealed high
   repeatabilities (0.97-0.98) suggest a strong contribution of the
   individual temperament on the behaviour of racehorses.}},

   research-based measure of psychopathy features consisting of separate
   emotional detachment (or affective) and antisocial tendencies (or
   behavioral) subscales. These psychopathy features and various
   externatizing symptoms (i.e., conduct problems, impulsivity, and
   substance use disorder) were assessed through rating scales and
   structured diagnostic interview at an intake assessment (ages 16-18) and
   6-year follow-up. Consistent with prediction, adolescent psychopathy
   features displayed moderate stability across the transition from
   adolescence to adulthood {[}intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) =

   most externalizing symptoms both in adolescence and in adulthood,

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences
   are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon
   covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty,
   willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of
   temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics,
   pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have
   examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation
   is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important
   influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that
   individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst
   animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament
   include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the
   link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in
   terminology with similar traits often given different names, or
   different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can
   and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and
   provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for
   ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major
   temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance,
   activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make
   inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes,
   which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from
   working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that
   demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness
   and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution.
   Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and
   point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit
   from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity,
   conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examined the seasonal and intraindividual variation
   in objectively measured physical activity in 11- to 12-yr-olds. Methods:
   Children were asked to wear a uniaxial accelerometer for 7 d four times
   throughout the course of about a year. A random-intercepts model was
   used to separate the inter- and intraindividual components of physical
   activity. Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), height, and month of
   measurement were fitted to the model as potential confounders. Results:
   A total of 315 children had valid data for at least two measurement
   occasions, and 244 had data for all four measurement occasions. The
   unadjusted intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for total activity
   (counts per minute) was 0.54; 0.49 after adjusting for gender, age, and
   BMI; and 0.53 after adjusting for gender, age, BMI, and month. Further
   adjustment for pubertal status at baseline had no effect on the ICC.
   Restricting the analysis to only those with data for all four
   measurement occasions (N = 244), or to measurements taken on schooldays
   only, had no effect on the ICC. The fully adjusted ICC was 0.51 for
   weekdays only and 0.39 for weekend days only. For minutes of moderate to
   vigorous physical activity, minutes of vigorous activity, minutes of
   sedentary behavior, and number of 30-min blocks of sedentary behavior,
   the fully adjusted ICC were 0.45, 0.37, 0.59, and 0.39, respectively.
   The analysis was repeated for boys and girls separately, but the
   differences in ICC were small. Conclusion: There was substantial
   intraindividual variation in the objectively measured physical activity
   of these children. Studies using single a measurement occasion where
   physical activity is the exposure should take this into account to
   adjust for regression dilution.}},

Abstract = {{1. Correlations between phenotypic traits are important in a number of
   contexts in physiological ecology, evolutionary physiology, and
   behaviour. Correlations can reflect functional connections or trade-offs
   among performance traits (e.g. bite force, jumping distance) and can
   reveal causal relationships between whole-organism traits and
   lower-level biochemical or morphological traits.
   2. However, when one or both traits exhibit intraindividual variability
   (i.e. repeatability < 1), conventional estimates of Pearson
   product-moment correlation coefficients are biased towards zero (=
   attenuated). The magnitude of this bias decreases with increases in the
   number of measurements used to calculate the mean value of the trait for
   each individual. The bias varies inversely with the repeatability of
   each trait.
   3. We present an estimator for the correlation coefficient that
   eliminates this bias. This estimator is based on an equation originally
   presented in 1904 by Spearman, and applied by researchers in
   psychological testing and nutritional epidemiology. The estimator is a
   simple function of the within- and among-individual components of
   variance for each of the two traits.
   4. Simulations show that optimal sampling effort usually involves a
   small number of trials per individual and a large sample of individuals
   (for a fixed total sample size), although correlations between traits
   with low repeatabilities may be more precisely estimated with a larger
   number of trials per individual and a smaller number of individuals.
   5. In addition to reducing the accuracy of the estimate, attenuation
   also reduces statistical power for detecting significant correlations.
   However, we do not recommend using the unbiased estimator for testing
   whether correlations differ from zero, because this inflates Type I
   error rates. Instead, the uncorrected (conventional) estimator should be
   used for hypothesis testing.
   6. The unbiased estimator is not appropriate for correlations involving
   maximum or minimum values for each individual (e.g. maximum sprint
   speed) because sampling distributions of these extreme values typically
   have different properties than the sampling distributions of individual
   mean values.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of personality implies individual differences in behavior
   and physiology that show some degree of repeatability/consistency over
   time and across contexts. Most studies of animal personality,
   particularly studies of individuals' variation in physiological
   mechanisms, have been conducted on selected individuals in controlled
   conditions. We attempted to detect consistent behaviors as well as
   physiological patterns in greylag ganders (Anser anser) from a
   free-roaming flock living in semi-natural conditions. We tested 10
   individuals repeatedly, in a handling trial, resembling tests for
   characterization of ``temperaments{''} in captive animals. We recorded
   the behavior of the same 10 individuals during four situations in the
   socially intact flock: (1) a ``low density feeding condition{''}, (2) a
   ``high density feeding condition{''}, (3) a ``low density post-feeding
   situation{''} and (4) while the geese rested. We collected fecal samples
   for determination of excreted immuno-reactive corticosterone (BM) and
   testosterone metabolites (TM) after handling trials, as well as the
   ``low density feeding{''} and the ``high density feeding{''} conditions.
   BM levels were very highly consistent over the repeats of handling
   trials, and the ``low density feeding condition{''} and tended to be
   consistent over the first two repeats of the ``high density feeding
   condition{''}. Also, BM responses tended to be consistent across
   contexts. Despite seasonal variation, there tended to be inter-test
   consistency of TM, which pointed to some individual differences in TM as
   well. Aggressiveness turned out to be a highly repeatable trait, which
   was consistent across social situations, and tended to correlate with an
   individual's resistance during handling trials. Also, ``proximity to the
   female partner{''} and ``sociability{''} - the average number of
   neighboring geese in a close distance while resting - were consistent.
   We conclude that aggressiveness, ``affiliative tendencies{''} and levels
   of excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites may be crucial
   factors of personality in geese. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{According to indicator models of sexual selection, mates may obtain
   indirect, i.e. genetic, benefits from choosing partners indicating high
   overall genetic quality by honest signals. In the scorpionfly Panorpa
   vulgaris, both sexes show mating preferences on the basis of the
   condition of the potential partners. Females prefer males that produce
   nuptial gifts (i.e. salivary secretions) during copulation, while males
   invest more nuptial gifts in females of high nutritional status. Both
   characters, males' ability to produce nuptial gifts and high nutritional
   status of females, are known to be reliable indicators of foraging
   ability. Thus, besides possible direct benefits, both sexes might also
   obtain indirect benefits in terms of ``good foraging genes{''} by their
   choice and thereby increase the fitness of their offspring. A
   prerequisite for this possibility is the heritability of the respective
   trait. In the present study, we estimated the repeatability and the
   heritability of foraging ability. Our results indicate (1) a significant
   repeatability of individual foraging efficiencies in males and females

   proposed to account for helping behaviour. We investigated differences
   in 157 calls given by 12 different individuals as they provisioned
   nestlings, including both breeding and helper bell miners Manorina
   melanophrys (Meliphagidae), a cooperatively breeding honeyeater endemic
   to south-eastern Australia. Individual differences were apparent in all
   15 call parameters analysed, many with a high level of repeatability.
   Moreover, the information capacity of mew calls allows as many as 515
   different signatures to exist in the system. As many parameters showed
   strong sex differences, separate discriminant functions were used to
   predict individual identity within each sex. Five parameters were used
   in a function that correctly identified over 90\% of female calls in
   both a training (n=35) and test dataset (n=11) not used to generate the
   function. Among males, a separate function used six parameters to
   correctly assign individual identity in 89.3\% (n=84; training) and
   77.8\% (n=27; test) of cases. Three original parameters, including
   spectral and spatial characteristics, were highly correlated with
   functions predicting identity in both sexes. The accuracy of functions
   was not influenced by a signaller's sex, breeding status, or by sampling
   period which was spread over as much as two breeding seasons within
   individuals. Significant potential therefore exists for bell miners to
   use these simple provisioning calls in individual discrimination. If
   this is the case, call information also has the potential to be used by
   receivers as predicted by signalling hypotheses proposed to account for
   cooperative helping behaviour, such as the pay-to-stay and social
   prestige hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were 1) to compare temperament assessments,
   using multiple techniques and over repeated observations, to gauge
   temperament over the long-term and 2) to evaluate the relationship of
   the temperament appraisals with serum concentrations of cortisol (CS).
   Measures of temperament were gathered over 3 repeated observations (60-d
   interval) of yearling, fall-born Brahman bulls (initial BW = 320 +/- 4
   kg; n = 66). Temperament assessments included exit velocity (EV), which
   was the rate at which the bulls exited the squeeze chute and traversed a
   fixed distance (1.83 m); pen scores (PEN; 1 = quiet to 5 = excited),
   ascertained from animal behavior while penned in small groups (n = 5);
   and chute scores (CHUTE; 1 = quiet to 5 = excited), determined from
   behavioral responses to restraint on the weigh scale. Temperament
   measures obtained during the initial data collection (d 0) were all
   positively correlated (r >= 0.35, P < 0.005) with one another.
   Additionally, PEN (r = 0.29, P < 0.05) and EV (r = 0.26, P < 0.05) were
   positively correlated with CS, whereas CHUTE was not (r = 0.09, P =
   0.46). All serial EV measures were positively correlated (r > 0.31, P <
   0.02). All PEN were positively correlated (r > 0.31, P < 0.01), whereas
   serial measures of CHUTE were not (P > 0.3). Exit velocity was
   positively correlated with CS within d 0 (r = 0.26, P = 0.04) and 120 (r
   = 0.44, P < 0.01). The EV data obtained at d 0 were transformed into a
   discrete variable, EV ranking (EV RANK; 1 to 3 scale), in which 1
   equated to < 1 SD below the mean and 3 equated to > 1 SD above the mean.
   Mean EV (P < 0.01) decreased from d 0 (2.82 +/- 0.07 m/sec) to 120 (2.11
   +/- 0.10 m/sec). Time also influenced (P < 0.01) CS; mean CS decreased
   between d 0 (14.6 +/- 0.7 ng/mL) and 120 (11.1 +/- 0.8 ng/mL). Measures
   of EV can be a valuable tool for the assessment of cattle temperament
   and a possible predictor of temperament and stress responsiveness to
   future animal handling events.}},

Abstract = {{Sea turtles have a high reproductive output and high mortality at early
   stages of the life cycle. In particular, many nests are laid below or

   such doomed eggs to higher ground. This article examines this practice
   in the light of recent data revealing that some individual turtles tend
   to nest relatively near the water and others relatively higher up the
   beach. Discussion is focused on the question of why apparently poor
   placement of nests has not been selected against. Comparison between the
   ecology of leatherback and hawksbill turtle nesting beaches suggests
   that predictability of environmental conditions on the nesting beaches
   has an important influence on patterns of nest-site selection. Options
   are outlined for the management of nesting beaches where a high

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Preterm birth has been associated with increased parenting
   stress in early infancy, and some reports have found this to be a risk
   factor for later behavioral problems. There are, however, few studies
   and conflicting results. Information about the fathers is scarce.
   OBJECTIVES. Our goal was to study the effects of an early-intervention
   program on parenting stress after a preterm birth until 1 year corrected
   age.
   METHODS. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted including infants
   with a birth weight < 2000 g treated at the University Hospital of North
   Norway Trust, which serves the 2 northern-most counties in Norway, to
   examine the effects of a modified version of the Mother-Infant
   Transaction Program on parenting stress measured by the Parenting Stress
   Index. A term control group was also recruited. The Parenting Stress
   Index was administered to the mothers at 6 and 12 months' corrected age
   and to the fathers at 12 months' corrected age. The intervention
   consisted of 8 sessions shortly before discharge and 4 home visits by
   specially trained nurses focusing on the infant's unique
   characteristics, temperament, and developmental potential and the
   interaction between the infant and the parents.
   RESULTS. Seventy-one infants were included in the preterm intervention
   group, and 69 were included in the preterm control group. The preterm
   groups were well balanced. Seventy-four infants were included in the
   term control group. Compared with the preterm controls, both the mothers
   and fathers in the preterm intervention group reported significant lower
   scores in child domain, parent domain, and total stress on all occasions
   except the mother-reported child domain at 12 months. These differences
   were not related to birth weight or gestational age. The level of stress
   among the preterm intervention group was comparable to their term peers.
   Both parents in the intervention group reported consistently lower
   scores within the distractibility/hyperactivity, reinforces parents,
   competence, and attachment subscales compared with the preterm control
   group. There were no differences in mean summary stress scores between
   the mothers and fathers in the 2 preterm groups at 12 months, but the
   intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in the intervention group.
   CONCLUSIONS. This early-intervention program reduces parenting stress
   among both mothers and fathers of preterm infants to a level comparable
   to their term peers. We are now studying whether this will result in
   long-term beneficial effects.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Although everyone working in routine mental health
   services recognizes the scientific and ethical importance to ensure that
   treatments being provided are of highest quality, there is a clear lack
   of consensus regarding what outcome domains to include, what measure of
   assessment to use and, moreover, who to question when assessing.
   Literature findings. Since the fifties, social functioning is considered
   as an important dimension to take into account for treatment planning
   and outcome measuring. But for many years, symptoms scales have been
   considered as sufficient outcome measures and social functioning
   improvement expected on the basis of symptoms alleviation. As symptoms
   and social adjustment sometimes appear relatively independent, no
   accurate conclusion concerning the patient's social functioning can so
   be driven on the basis of his clinical symptoms. More attention has then
   been directed toward the development of instruments specifically
   intended to measure the extent and nature of social functioning
   impairments observed in most psychiatric syndromes. Many of these
   instruments are designed to be completed by caregivers or remain time
   consuming and difficult to use routinely. Presently, in clinical
   practice, there is a need to rely on simple and brief instruments
   considering patients' perspective about their social adjustment as a
   function of time. Aim of the study. The aim of this study is to present
   a new instrument, the QFS, initially developed in order to assess social
   functioning in patients involved in group psychotherapy programs
   conducted in a specialist mental health setting, as well as its
   psychometric characteristics. Methodology. It was designed to be
   completed in less than 10 minutes and the questions are phrased in a
   simple and redundant way, in order to limit problems inherent to
   illiteracy or language comprehension. The OFS is a 16 items self-report
   instrument that assesses both the frequency of (8 items) and the
   satisfaction with (8 items) various social behaviours adopted during the
   2 weeks period preceding the assessment. It yields three separate
   indexes of social functioning, defined a priori and labelled <<
   frequency >>, << satisfaction >> and << global >>. The higher the
   scores, the better the social functioning. The OFS was administered to
   457 subjects, aged between 18 and 65, including 176 outpatients (99 with
   anxious or depressive disorders, 25 with personality disorders and 52
   with psychotic disorders) and 281 healthy control subjects. Results. No
   significant difference was found between patients and controls according
   to age or gender distribution. Acceptance rate was high (> 95\%).
   Moreover, the QFS was generally acceptable to the clinicians who used
   it. Internal consistency calculated for each index ranged from 0.65 to
   0.83 (Cronbach alpha). Test-retest reliability, calculated within a 15
   days time interval on a sample of 49 healthy controls, ranged from 0.69
   to 0.71 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Discriminant validity was
   calculated on healthy controls and patients divided into sub-groups
   according to their diagnosis. It showed to be excellent, with
   significantly higher scores in control subjects than in psychiatric
   patients and significant differences across diagnostic categories
   (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc tests, all p < 0.05).
   The convergent validity of the QFS with other measures of social
   functioning was calculated, using the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation
   Scale (SASS) and the Social Adjustment Scale Self-eport (SAS-SR). With
   the SASS, the convergent validity was higher among patients (Spearman
   r(S) 0.71 to 0.92, p < 0.01) than controls (r(S) from 0.49 to 0.66, p <
   0.001). In healthy controls, correlation with the SAS-SR was moderate
   but statistically significant (r(S) from -0.21 to -0.44, p < 0.05). When
   comparing OFS scores with self-rated symptoms severity, lower levels of
   social functioning were significantly associated with more severe
   symptoms according to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI: r(S) from -0.38
   to -0,65, p < 0.001). The QFS indexes demonstrated sensitivity to change
   (Wilcoxon : all p < 0.05) on a sample of 27 but-patients suffering from
   anxious-depressive disorders questioned before and after 4 months of
   cognitive behavioural group therapy running on a weekly basis during 16
   sessions of 2 hours-each. The factorial validity of the CPS was
   measured;through 3 separate factor analysis conducted using the data of
   4-57 subjects., The first analysis, considered only Frequency items; 7
   out of 8 items had loadings above 0.5 on factor 1 accounting for 30.7\%
   (unrotaded) of the variance. The second analysis considered only
   Satisfaction items; all items had loadings above 0.6 on Factor 1
   explaining 43.4\% (unrotaded) of the variance. And finally, in the third
   factor analysts, all, QFS items were included; 15 out of 16 items had
   loadings above 0.4 on Factor 1 accounting for 30\% (unrotated) of the
   variance. Conceming the factorial validity of the instrument, these
   results suggest that all QFS items belong to the same underlying
   dimension. Discussion. Finally, provisional norms for the QFS are
   provided for healthy controls in order to characterise individual
   patients or patients subgroups. In conclusion, the need for assessment
   in clinical routine, in order to estimate different aspects of patients
   conditions aswell as the qualify of the treatment provided, has
   contributed to the development of a large variety of instruments
   measuring several domains. Concerning the level of social functioning,
   many instruments fail to meet chief criterion of feasibility, remaining
   often too complex or time onsuming. Moreover, only few of them are
   available in French. Conclusion. The QFS presented here is a brief,
   simple and easy to administer self-rating scale that displays
   satisfactory psychometric properties. It seems to be a valuable
   instrument for the monitoring of social functioning in psychiatric
   patients Which, from a therapeutic point of view, may have a clear
   impact as it sets up expectation of change and allows both to-reality
   testpatibnts and therapists beliefs about the presence of progress or
   not and to identify if therapy is working on this specific outcome
   domain. Though, to date, the administration of the OFS to other
   populations and treatment modalities requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in growth, feed intake and feeding behaviour has
   been previously recognized in several fish species. However, there is a
   lack of information regarding the consistency of such individual
   differences, which is important to understand the probability of a
   certain individual trait to be inherent, i.e. genetically linked. The
   goal of this study is to quantify the consistency of individual
   differences in growth, feed intake/efficiency and feeding behaviour in
   African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell 1822). Forty-eight juvenile
   fish (58.9 +/- 0.4 g) were housed individually for 47 days and weighed
   every second week. The consistency of growth, feed efficiency (residual
   feed intake (RFI)) and feeding behaviour (total feeding time (TFT)) was
   determined using repeatability estimates. Fish exhibited pronounced
   individual variation in growth (CV=52.8\%), feed intake (34.3\%) and in
   the TFT (> 100\%). The repeatability estimates were 0.55 for growth,
   0.70 for feed intake, 0.49 for RFI and 0.81 for TFT. Individual
   differences in growth were mainly explained by individual differences in
   feed intake (similar to 80\%). Individual differences in feeding
   behaviour contributed to explain differences in feed intake by affecting
   the RFI. With increasing TFT, the maintenance levels also increased
   suggesting that slow eaters were less efficient in feed/energy
   utilization. The results of this study indicate that individual
   differences in growth, feed intake/efficiency and feeding behaviour are
   consistent over time and therefore probably inherent. Moreover, this
   study may have implications on the use of feeding behaviour as a
   predictor of feed efficiency in juveniles of African catfish.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of personality implies intra-individual consistency of
   behavioural and physiological responses towards given situations over
   time. In this study, we investigated the long-term intra-individual
   consistency of the reaction towards social separation in dairy cows, Bos
   taurus taurus. In 35 animals, behavioural and adrenocortical reactions
   towards a 20 min social separation were examined. The separation test
   was carried out four times over a period of two lactations. Our subjects
   showed the expected reactions of cattle towards social separation such
   as exploration, walking, vocalisation, defecation, urination, and an
   increase in saliva cortisol concentration. We calculated a high
   repeatability of all behaviours tested and of saliva cortisol response
   towards this stressor throughout two lactations. Particular parameters
   (saliva cortisol response, duration of exploration, and number of
   entered squares) decreased across repetitions indicating a habituation.
   In contrast, the frequency of vocalisation, vigilance, and walking did
   not change across repetitions. Consequently, the different temporal
   changes of the measures may reflect that the response is mediated by
   different motivations. To address this issue, we examined the potential
   underlying structure of behaviour using principal component analysis. We
   could distinguish three principal components reflecting sociability,
   exploration, and anxiety. These three components are included in two
   (Neuroticism, Extraversion) of the five main dimensions known from human
   personality structure. In conclusion, the intra-individual behavioural
   consistency can be explained in terms of underlying personality
   structures, which show considerable generality across species. In farm
   animals, consideration of personality structures may be crucial
   concerning animal welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Animal `personalities' or behavioural syndromes can be defined as
   individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours. Using
   chaffinches Fringilla coelebs temporarily held in captivity, we
   determined the extent to which activity level (AL), the behavioural
   response to a stressful situation (BRSS) and two anti-predation risk
   behaviours when exposed to a model predator were inter-correlated within
   individuals. We assayed AL and BRSS when the chaffinches were first put
   in an experimental room. Subsequently we recorded their initial response
   (freeze or escape) to the sudden appearance of a model hawk, in addition
   to their latency to resume activity afterwards as a measure of
   cautiousness ('latency'). Each bird was assayed in two situations that
   differed in the risk level posed and in the assumed optimal response
   required to minimize predation risk: (I) high risk, when the hawk flew
   directly over the chaffinch and the assumed optimal response was to
   escape; and (2) low risk, when the model hawk flew 2 m to the side of
   the chaffinch and, since the bird was not being targeted, the assumed
   optimal response was to freeze in order to avoid attracting attention.
   All of the variables had relatively high repeatabilities and were
   inter-correlated, providing strong evidence for a behavioural syndrome.
   Though propensity to freeze was much greater in the low risk treatment,
   AL was negatively correlated with freezing behaviour in both risk
   treatments, and therefore there was a `behavioural carryover' across
   situations. While hypoactive individuals were more likely to freeze in
   the low risk treatment, and were therefore assumed to be better able to
   assess risk compared to hyperactive individuals, some hypoactive
   individuals also froze in the high risk situation when it was assumed to
   be inappropriate to do so. Despite this apparently maladaptive behaviour
   in the high risk situation, overall hypoactive individuals showed a
   greater degree of behavioural plasticity across treatments compared to
   hyperactives. Taken together our results support the hypothesis of
   differential predation risk among personality types. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current interest in personalities, and
   for predation risk and group-living theories.}},

Abstract = {{Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in
   1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of
   Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of
   genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and
   recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding,
   grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these
   behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative
   genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41\% of
   the variation in activity; 8.60\% of the variation was explained by a
   significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic
   variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity
   explained 11.13\% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and
   sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component
   behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common
   rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups
   within genotype accounted for 19.47\% variation in activity, and
   activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group
   behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting
   individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across
   groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation
   in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01\%), and
   this is an additional level on which selection could operate:
   individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could
   change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution.
   Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by
   conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute
   to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome
   governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among
   behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot
   evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches
   of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when
   considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to
   understand how behaviors evolve.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{721-732}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Current theory suggests that most animal behaviours are the product of
   complex interactions between learning and inheritance. Optimal foraging
   theory predicts that animals should alter their foraging tactics
   depending on abundance and quality of available prey, and that at least
   some components of foraging behaviour must be heritable. Successful
   foraging behaviour, therefore, may require an individual to become an
   efficient predator on several novel prey types throughout its lifetime,
   and such aptitude may have a genetic basis. We examined foraging
   behaviour of the red-backed salamander to test two main hypotheses: (1)
   that salamanders at each of three age classes (neonates, yearlings and
   adults) would increase their foraging efficiency with increasing
   exposure to novel prey and (2) that various foraging parameters would
   have a genetic component. All age classes showed a significant increase
   in foraging efficiency after their first exposure to a novel prey type.
   Significant clutch differences and heritability estimates suggest that
   some aspects of foraging (e.g. prey recognition and latency to prey
   capture) may be influenced by genetics. Individuals that captured fewer
   prey items as neonates were less likely to survive to become yearlings
   under standardized laboratory conditions. This suggests that genetic
   variation in foraging efficiency may be directly related to future
   fitness (i.e. may influence mortality rates). This study indicates that
   learning, at all ages, plays an important role in successful foraging
   and that differences in foraging efficiency between individuals may have
   a genetic component. (c) 2005 The Association for the study of Animal

Abstract = {{We investigated the consistency of behaviour over repeated tests in
   dogs, Canis familiaris. Dogs were tested three times, with an average of
   30 and 35 days between tests. The behavioural test used in the study
   included 10 subtests that exposed dogs to various situations, such as
   the appearance of an unfamiliar person, play, preylike objects, metallic
   noise and a suddenly appearing dummy. Studies using the same test with
   many dogs have revealed five specific personality traits, labelled
   Playfulness, Chase-proneness, Curiosity/Fearlessness, Sociability and
   Aggressiveness, and one higher-order, broader dimension, interpreted as
   a shyness-boldness continuum. We used these traits in the present study.
   We found significant correlations over the test series in all the
   specific traits as well as in the Boldness dimension. The magnitude of
   trait scores for Playfulness, Chase-proneness and Sociability, as well
   as for the Boldness dimension, was stable between tests. The scores for
   Aggressiveness and Curiosity/Fearlessness, however, differed between the
   first two tests: the intensity of behaviour related to fear and
   aggression decreased from test 1 to test 2, but the intensity of
   exploratory behaviour increased. This result indicates that these two
   traits in dogs are sensitive to novelty although individual differences
   are also maintained in nonovel situations. The results suggest that
   playful, social, exploratory avoidant and aggressive behaviour in dog is
   influenced by stable dispositions; i.e. personality traits, that seem to
   have been important during the evolution of the domestic dog. (C) 2004

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{43-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Piglet mortality is a major welfare and economic problem in the pig
   industry. Despite the use of farrowing crates, piglet crushing remains a
   major contributor to pre-weaning piglet mortality, which is typically
   around 12\%. Our aims in this study were to quantify variability between
   sows and consistency across parities in crushing mortality, and to
   examine the effect of the environment on variability. In our first
   study, we compared the variability in crushing mortality in 122
   primiparous sows (gilts) that farrowed in crates (71) or open pens (51).
   Certain sows crushed more or fewer piglets than expected by chance.
   Crushing was more frequent and more variable in pens compared to crates,
   indicating that crates may mask differences between sows. In our second
   study, we recorded piglet mortality for 125 sows, which farrowed in
   crates over several (4-9) parities. After adjusting for litter size,
   litter weight and parity effects, consistent individual differences
   between sows were evident. The repeatability of crushing was estimated
   at 0.14, with estimates of 0.18 and 0.05 for stillborns and total
   liveborn mortality, respectively. Although these repeatabilities are
   relatively low, there was a high degree of phenotypic variance (eg sows
   crushed between 0 and 30.8\% of their piglets). Given that sows show
   some consistency in piglet mortality over parities, this could be used
   to inform culling decisions. Additionally, if differences in piglet
   crushing between sows have a genetic component, a breeding programme
   might reduce mortality from crushing. Because crates restrict maternal
   behaviour, genetic selection in this system may have relaxed selection
   for good maternal behaviour. Selection for reduced piglet mortality, and
   thus improved maternal abilities, could remove a major obstacle to the
   wider adoption of less restrictive farrowing systems, with positive
   welfare consequences for the sow and piglets.}},

Title = {{Measuring quality of life: Comparing family members' and friends'

Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{111-129}},
Abstract = {{Background: A greater awareness of the social consequences of
   impairments and a growing need for patient-centred outcomes in
   contemporary health care has made it increasingly important for
   clinicians to gather information on clients' quality of life (QoL). As
   QoL measures typically require respondents to perform a number of
   complex language and cognitive processes, there is a valid concern as to
   whether clients with aphasia can reliably self-report. In this
   situation, significant others and healthcare providers are called upon
   to make judgements as proxy respondents. Evidence from medical and
   chronic disability and health literature suggests that the responses of
   proxies may be interchangeable with those of patients, however it is not
   known whether the same is true for language-impaired respondents.
   Aims: The current research compared scores from aphasic and proxy
   respondents to investigate whether proxy respondents could be used to
   obtain reliable information on aphasic people's QoL. Reliable
   information was considered as statistically similar group comparisons
   with small effect sizes, and moderate to good agreement between aphasic
   and proxy respondents' scores.
   Methods M Procedures: A total of 30 aphasic respondents aged 57 to 88
   years, and 30 proxy respondents (primarily spouses and children) aged 27
   to 82 years were interviewed separately by a speech and language
   therapist using four QoL measures: a global rating, the Short Form 36
   Health Survey, the Dartmouth COOP Charts, and the How I Feel About
   Myself well-being scale. A systematic cueing procedure was used to
   facilitate respondents' understanding. Subscale scores were compared for
   group differences using paired samples t tests and effect size
   calculations, and individually for agreement using intraclass
   correlations.
   Outcomes O Results: Proxy respondents demonstrated a significant
   systematic negative bias in rating their aphasic partners' global QoL,
   physical functioning, general or overall health, pain, and vitality.
   Conversely, proxy respondents rated statistically the same as their
   aphasic partners on physical fitness, feelings, daily activities,
   quality of life (COOP), total well-being, autonomy, environmental
   mastery, and purpose in life, with at least moderate agreement. similar
   to other literature, there was generally higher agreement for objective
   domains than subjective domains, and greater agreement on the SF-36 than
   the global rating measure, the COOP Charts, or the well-being scale.
   Conclusions: Family members and friends of people with aphasia cannot be
   interchangeably accepted as reliable informants of their partners' QoL.
   They rated their partners significantly lower in global and physical
   health-related QoL, and yet their systematic behaviours in ratings could
   be useful for clinicians and researchers as their aphasic partners'
   scores can be easily and confidently predicted. Conversely, they
   appeared to be reliable informants in other areas, namely feelings,
   daily activities, and well-being, as well as overall quality of life
   (when using the illustrated COOP QoL measure), however further research
   is needed to clarify statistical definitions and interpretations of
   reliability. Finally, there was no relationship between proxies' and
   aphasic partners' ratings of social health (functioning, activities,
   support, relations with others) and self-acceptance. Researchers and
   clinicians need to be aware of these biases when soliciting information
   from significant others, and further research is needed to develop QoL
   measures that are accessible for people with aphasia.}},

Abstract = {{Decisions made by birds during migration to breeding grounds can
   strongly affect the fitness of individuals. We investigated possible
   causes and reproductive consequences of inter-individual variation in
   the migratory behavior of an arctic-nesting species, the greater snow
   goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus), by radio-tracking females at
   their staging area and on their breeding grounds. Females showed
   relatively high repeatability in the duration of migration (r(i)=0.37)
   and arrival date on the breeding grounds (r(i)=0.42) suggesting that
   these traits are characteristics of individuals. Conversely, no
   individual consistency in departure date from the staging area was
   detected (r(i)=-0.02) indicating that environmental factors may have a
   large influence. Females paired with dominant males departed slightly
   earlier from the staging area than females accompanied by subordinate
   males. However, neither social status on the staging area (i.e. paired
   vs unpaired) nor dominance scores were associated with arrival time of
   individuals. Finally, the probability of breeding was positively related
   to arrival date indicating a reproductive cost of arriving too early on
   the breeding grounds. The combination of breeding probability and
   seasonal decline in breeding success nonetheless suggests that females
   arriving a few days earlier than the median arrival date attained
   highest reproductive success. Our results show that assessing the
   fitness consequences of early arrival by focusing solely on breeding
   females would lead to an overestimation of the genuine benefits. This
   study also indicates possible genetically based differences among
   individuals in migration duration and arrival time on the breeding

   three-wave data on twin pairs (N = 414 female monozygotic {[}MZ] and 197
   female dizygotic {[}DZ] pairs) and female twins from boy-girl pairs (N =
   300 twins) from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral

   male twins from boy-girl pairs. A total of 3172 and 2790 individual twin
   assessments were available in girls and boys, respectively, spanning

   Parameters of the mixed model including fixed effects of age and random
   effects of genes and environment were estimated by Markov Chain Monte

Abstract = {{Seasonal clocks (e.g., circannual clocks, seasonal interval timers)
   permit anticipation of regularly occurring environmental events by
   timing the onset of seasonal transitions in reproduction, metabolism,
   and behavior. Implicit in the concept that seasonal clocks reflect
   adaptations to the local environment is the unexamined assumption that
   heritable genetic variance exists in the critical features of such
   clocks, namely, their temporal properties. These experiments quantified
   the intraspecific variance in, and heritability of, the
   photorefractoriness interval timer in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus
   sungorus), a seasonal clock that provides temporal information to
   mechanisms that regulate seasonal transitions in body weight.
   Twenty-seven families consisting of 54 parents and 109 offspring were
   raised in a long-day photoperiod and transferred as adults to an
   inhibitory photoperiod (continuous darkness; DD). Weekly body weight
   measurements permitted specification of the interval of responsiveness
   to DD, a reflection of the duration of the interval timer, in each
   individual. Body weights of males and females decreased after exposure
   to DD, but 3 to 5 months later, somatic recrudescence occurred,
   indicative of photorefractoriness to DD. The interval timer was
   approximately 5 weeks longer and twice as variable in females relative
   to males. Analyses of variance of full siblings revealed an overall
   intraclass correlation of 0.71 +/- 0.04 (0.51 +/- 0.10 for male
   offspring and 0.80 +/- 0.06 for female offspring), suggesting a
   significant family resemblance in the duration of interval timers.
   Parent-offspring regression analyses yielded an overall heritability
   estimate of 0.61 +/- 0.2; h(2) estimates from parent-offspring
   regression analyses were significant for female offspring (0.91 +/- 0.4)
   but not for male offspring (0.35 +/- 0.2), indicating strong additive
   genetic components for this trait, primarily in females. In nature,
   individual differences, both within and between sexes, in the
   timekeeping properties of seasonal interval timers, and a strong
   heritable basis thereof, would provide ample substrate for selection to
   rapidly influence seasonal clocks. Balancing selection in environments
   where the onset of spring conditions varies from year to year could
   maintain genetic variance in interval timers and yield interval timers

   tested using Bayley Scales of Mental and Psycho-motor Development. The
   infant's working memory (W-M) was tested during A-not-B task
   performance, which was shown to depend on the maturity of the prefrontal
   cortex. The behavioral data were analyzed off-line using videotape
   records. The one-way ANOVA revealed that the AB performance improves

   the delay in A-not-B task was observed between 9 and 10 months of life.
   There was no longitudinal stability in individual infant performance of
   A-not-B across the period of 7-12 months of age. The AB delay was
   significantly correlated with psychomotor and mental development only
   after the crucial period of the rapid increase in the AB delay (9-10
   months). The analysis of intraclass mono- and dizygotic correlations
   showed that individual differences in the WM (tolerance to AB delay) at
   7-9 months and at 10-12 months are of different nature. There was a
   significant effect of shared environment on AB delay variance in
   10-12-month-old group, whereas down to this age no systematic influence

   ability to tolerate the AB delay can be provided by different brain

Abstract = {{Background Sensitivity theory proposes that there are wide individual

   Reiss Profile MR/ DD is a rating scale that measures 15 fundamental

   profiles.
   Method The study consisted of two distinct but related steps. First, the
   interrater reliability of the rating scale was established by having
   pairs of raters evaluate 49 individuals. Second, raters were presented
   with three different motivational profiles an asked to identify which
   one corresponded to the individual they had rated 4 weeks earlier.
   Results Results indicated good internal consistency (average alpha =
   0.84), significant variability in the interrater reliability (average
   intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.52), and excellent validity (95\%
   of the correct profiles were chosen). Average discrepancies between

Abstract = {{Personalities are general properties of humans and other animals.
   Different personality traits are phenotypically correlated, and
   heritabilities of personality traits have been reported in humans and
   various animals. In great tits, consistent heritable differences have
   been found in relation to exploration, which is correlated with various
   other personality traits. In this paper, we investigate whether or not
   risk-taking behaviour is part of these avian personalities. We found
   that (i) risk-taking behaviour is repeatable and correlated with
   exploratory behaviour in wild-caught hand-reared birds, (ii) in a
   bi-directional selection experiment on `fast' and `slow' early
   exploratory behaviour, bird lines tend to differ in risk-taking
   behaviour, and (iii) within-nest variation of risk-taking behaviour is
   smaller than between-nest variation. To show that risk-taking behaviour
   has a genetic component in a natural bird population, we bred great tits
   in the laboratory and artificially selected `high' and `low' risk-taking
   behaviour for two generations. Here, we report a realized heritability
   of 19.3 +/- 3.3\% (s.e.m.) for risk-taking behaviour. With these results
   we show in several ways that risk-taking behaviour is linked to
   exploratory behaviour, and we therefore have evidence for the existence
   of avian personalities. Moreover, we prove that there is heritable
   variation in more than one correlated personality trait in a natural
   population, which demonstrates the potential for correlated evolution.}},

Journal = {{AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{435-448}},
Abstract = {{Resident-intruder (R-I) tests can be used to measure the aggressive
   temperament of domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), and have previously been
   shown to predict the severity and persistence of aggression when
   unfamiliar pigs are mixed. To study the consistency of individual
   differences in aggressiveness over time, 112 pigs (eight from each of
   fourteen litters) were given two R-I tests at each of three ages (46,
   80, and 113 days). Pigs were R-I tested singly in an arena within the
   home pen, where a smaller unfamiliar intruder pig was introduced to a
   resident pig. Latency to the first attack by the resident was recorded,
   and the test was stopped as soon as an attack occurred, otherwise the
   test lasted five minutes. Pigs from eight of the litters used here had
   been allowed to mix with another litter prior to weaning (days 10-30;
   socialised), while pigs in six litters remained in littermate groups
   (control). To determine whether consistency would survive the effects of
   social disruption, pigs were mixed into new groups on two occasions
   between the first and second test, then remained in these groups until
   the third test. Evidence of consistency was found, despite the social
   disruption. Socialised pigs were more aggressive than controls, females
   were more aggressive than males, and certain litters were more
   aggressive than others. After adjusting for these, consistent
   differences between individuals were still evident. Consistency was
   higher between the second and third tests compared to the first and
   second, possibly because of stable group membership or the effects of
   age or experience. In support of the idea that social experience
   improves consistency, socialised pigs were more consistent than controls
   throughout. Evidence of consistent individual differences in aggressive
   temperament suggests that breeding or changes to early life experiences
   could have a long-lasting influence on aggressive behaviour in pigs. (C)

Abstract = {{Iguanian lizards perform conspicuous species-typical push-up displays,
   which are used in territory advertisement, threat, and courtship
   contexts. Subtle individually distinctive differences in push-up
   characteristics have been suggested to play a role in the recognition of
   social partners. However, if the structure of push-ups is responsive to
   changing physiological states then their capacity to promote recognition
   may be limited. The current study evaluated whether the push-ups
   performed while in an experimentally imposed state of fatigue by male
   side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), retain the individually
   distinctive characteristics apparent in rested lizards. We found
   repeatable among-individual differences in the duration and the relative
   height of push-up components. Repeatability values did not change
   consistently between the rested and fatigued conditions, nor when both
   conditions were pooled, indicating that these push-up characteristics do
   not change with fatigue. Similarly, discriminant functions that were
   generated using push-ups from one state assigned push-ups performed in
   an alternate state to the correct individuals. Furthermore, when
   analyzed independently of individual identity, the values of display
   parameters examined in the current study did not change significantly
   between states, and discriminant function analysis could not reliably
   classify push-ups to the correct state. Taken together the results show
   that individually distinctive push-up characteristics are robust to
   effects of fatigue, consistent with their suggested role in social
   recognition. In the future, video playback experiments can test whether
   lizards utilize the signature-like characteristics of push-ups to
   discriminate among individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotine has many acute subjective, physiological, and behavioral
   effects in humans, some of which may explain why nicotine produces
   dependence. Individual differences in the magnitude of these effects
   (i.e., nicotine sensitivity) are of interest to many researchers, such
   as those examining vulnerability to dependence and processes related to
   chronic tolerance. However, such characterization of individual
   differences depends on the consistency of the observed responses, and
   the consistency of acute effects of nicotine in humans has not been
   studied systematically. We examined the consistency of the acute effects
   of the same dose of nicotine administered by nasal spray across multiple
   drug administration trials, within as well as between sessions.
   Subjective (i.e., self-reported effects), cardiovascular, and
   performance measures were assessed following each of four dosing trials
   of nicotine (20 mug/kg) on three sessions and of placebo on one session.
   For those measures in which the main effect of nicotine vs. placebo was
   significant, intraclass correlations were calculated for different sets
   of trials across different numbers of sessions. Our objective was to
   determine whether the consistency of responses declined when those
   responses were based on smaller numbers of trials or sessions, in an
   effort to guide future research in this area. Results indicated that the
   consistency of nicotine effects is generally high, even across trials
   within just one session. Additional research is needed to determine the
   generalizability of these findings to other methods of nicotine
   administration, including smoking, and to clarify the extent to which
   this consistency reflects characteristic consistency of the

Abstract = {{Interest in relationships between behaviour and development has been
   spurred by research on related topics, including phenotypic plasticity,
   parental effects, extragenetic inheritance, individual differences and
   trait syndromes. Here, I consider several emerging areas of research in
   the interface between behaviour and development, with a focus on
   behavioural processes that are likely to affect the development and
   maintenance of interindividual variation in a wide array of
   morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. Using a norm of
   reaction approach, I introduce and illustrate the complexities of
   phenotypic development. Next, I consider the implications of
   environmental selection and niche construction for phenotypic
   development, and consider why these behavioural processes are likely to
   encourage the development and maintenance of repeatable, stable
   individual differences and trait syndromes. Parental effects involving
   behaviour also affect the development of a wide array of phenotypic
   traits; differential allocation is a currently underappreciated type of
   parental effect, by which males can affect the development of their
   offspring via nongenetic means, even if those males have no contact with
   their young. Behavioural parental effects also contribute to
   extragenetic inheritance, and recent studies suggest that this
   phenomenon may be more widespread than previously suspected. The effects
   of behavioural processes on phenotypic development have interesting
   implications for problems in related disciplines (e.g. ecology,
   evolution and conservation biology), providing additional impetus for
   future research on the effects of behavioural mechanisms on the

Abstract = {{Fear induced by exposure to humans, and anxiety induced by novel
   environmental changes may both function as stressors and have negative
   effects on reproduction in pigs. An earlier experiment indicated that
   reactions to humans and novelty had some repeatability between the ages
   of 8 and 24 weeks, thus reflecting personality traits. The present
   experiment therefore tested for predicted negative relationships between
   behaviour related to fear and anxiety measured at 8 weeks of age and
   later reproduction in 30 sows. Factor analysis of behaviour in a
   voluntary human approach test performed in the home cage and a novel
   object test performed in a novel arena indicated that behavioural
   measures related to investigation of these stimuli loaded on separate
   factors and may therefore reflect independent underlying dimensions. One
   factor related to investigation of the human was interpreted as
   reflecting the level of fear of humans, while another was correlated to
   investigation of the novel object and interpreted as indicating
   novelty-induced anxiety. Factor scores were generated for `fear' and
   `anxiety' and used in regression analysis as predictors of maternal
   behaviour and reproductive parameters. Higher levels of fear of humans
   were associated with longer durations of farrowing, larger variation in
   inter-birth intervals, and a higher number of piglets dying without milk
   in their stomachs. The duration of farrowing was positively correlated
   to the number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. Higher
   fear also tended to associate with a higher number of stillborn and a
   higher number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. High
   anxiety only tended to be associated with a higher number of stillborn.
   These results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that there
   are negative associations between fear of humans and maternal ability in

Abstract = {{In many avian species, substantial individual variation occurs in
   parental food-provisioning levels, which often is assumed to reflect
   variation in parental quality. Parental quality also has often been
   invoked as a key element in mate choice among biparental species, and
   many sexually-selected traits have been investigated as potential
   predictors of parental quality. In recent studies of house sparrow
   (Passer domesticus) parents, we found that individuals behaved
   remarkably consistently across time, regardless of temporary
   manipulations of the nestling provisioning of their partners. This
   suggests that variation in parental competence may be attributable to
   quality differences among individuals. One prediction of the `parental
   quality differences' hypothesis is that individuals also should show
   consistency in their provisioning behavior across broods. To test this,
   we compared the parental delivery rates of individual house sparrows
   across broods. Parents of both sexes reduced their per-chick delivery
   rates as the season progressed; parents of both sexes were also
   responsive to changes in their brood sizes. Despite these sources of
   environmental variation in provisioning rates, the parental care of
   individual males was highly repeatable across broods. By contrast,
   female parental care showed extremely low repeatability, and
   standardized measures of among-individual variation in parental behavior
   revealed females to be much less variable than males. These results
   indicate that females in this multi-brooded species have much to gain
   from mate-choice decisions predicated on male parental quality or
   accurate indicators of such, whereas males are less likely to profit
   from being highly selective about the `parental quality' of their

Abstract = {{The coping styles hypothesis states that animals have consistent
   behavioural and physiological coping responses that can be characterised
   on a continuum from reactive to proactive. According to this hypothesis,
   animals can be characterised by consistency in responses across social
   and non-social situations as well as over time. We evaluated the
   validity of this hypothesis for predicting the coping responses of pigs
   by testing for predicted correlations between responses to a variety of
   challenges. Animals were exposed to an immobility test at 3 weeks of
   age. At 8 and 24 weeks, animals were exposed to an unknown pig in the
   test animal's home cage, a human in the home cage, and a novel object
   (bucket) in a novel arena. None of the predicted correlations were found
   between the duration of immobility and behaviour in the later tests.
   Many behavioural measures had some repeatability between the ages of 8
   and 24 weeks, despite significant changes in the observed level of
   responses, but there were few correlations between responses to social
   and non-social situations. Responses to a human and novel object were
   positively correlated when measured at 8 weeks but not at 24 weeks. The
   results indicate that the coping styles hypothesis has very limited
   value in predicting the coping responses of pigs representing the
   population as a whole. The existing correlations could more
   parsimoniously be described as reflecting responses to specific or
   closely related stimuli. It is suggested that future research on pig
   personality should investigate the possibility that specific coping
   behaviours-for example, those mediated by fear and anxiety-may have
   consequences for different elements of coping ability related to welfare

   Results: There was fair to moderate agreement between assessments of
   personality provided by the patients themselves and their significant
   others, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.44 to
   0.54 for the different domains of personality. Patient assessments on
   the NEO-FFI were found to be robust with no significant changes in four
   of the five personality domains at 2 years postinjury. We also found
   that personality traits of patients are related to patient
   characteristics and behaviors in the directions that were expected.
   Conclusions: The NEO-FFI is a brief, valid, and stable measure of
   underlying personality traits that is practical for use in a trauma
   setting. Its use in both outcomes research and patient evaluation should
   be encouraged. In cases in which patients cannot complete the test,
   evaluations by significant others may be useful.}},

Abstract = {{Temperament traits in animals are those which are stable across time and
   predictive of behaviour in other situations. Individuals can be
   identified as showing either active (proactive) or passive (re-active)
   responses to a variety of challenges, and these are often referred to as
   `coping styles'. Although most studied in rodents, coping styles are
   found in a variety of vertebrate species. In rodents, the resident-
   intruder aggressiveness test is a key measure of coping style, whereas
   in pigs, several recent studies have used a `backtest' as the key
   measure of coping: A piglet is held on its back for one minute and the
   frequency of struggling bouts ('escape attempts') is recorded. In this
   study, we compared pig behaviour in backtests performed on 3 and 9 days
   of age, with aggressiveness was measured using 2 resident-intruder tests
   between 16 and 19 days post-weaning. A smaller unfamiliar intruder was
   introduced into part of the resident pig's home pen, and resident attack
   latency was recorded. Struggling bout frequency in the backtests showed
   a unimodal distribution. Data were analysed both as a continuous
   distribution and by comparing only the piglets from either extreme of
   the distribution (for comparison with other studies, top and bottom
   25\%). There was good repeatability of outcome (struggling frequency)
   over the two backtests, and over the two resident-intruder tests (attack
   latency and occurrence of resident attacks). However, no relationship
   was found between behaviour in the backtests and aggression in the
   resident-intruder tests, despite exhaustive analysis. Other authors have
   found that pigs show consistent responses to challenges, suggesting a
   degree of stable temperament. In line with the present findings though,
   most found no correlation between social and non-social responses. Other
   published experiments show that in pigs, the backtest can predict
   several physiological differences characteristic of coping styles.
   However, the present study shows that in pigs, aggressiveness and
   struggling in a backtest are not correlated, suggesting that they do not
   represent different expressions of the same underlying `coping' trait.}},

Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We examined the repeatability of pig nursing behaviour and its
   relationship with maternal investment (measured in piglet growth) in two
   experiments. In Experiment 1, eleven sows were followed for 2-5 (median
   3) lactations, and their nursing behaviour was recorded on Day 11 post
   partum during each of these lactations. In Experiment 2, fourteen sows
   were followed for two consecutive lactations, and their nursing
   behaviour recorded on Days 7 and 28. In Experiment 2, the data on piglet
   growth between Days 1 and 6, and between Days 6 and 28 were also
   recorded, and mortality data were available in both experiments. We
   evaluated the data in order to get answers to three basic questions:
   First, was the nursing behaviour repeatable within and across
   lactations, i.e. did the sow have individually stable nursing styles?
   Second, was the variability in nursing behaviour related to piglet
   growth or mortality? Third, were the sows inclined to nurse repeatedly
   on one side and if so, did this result in faster growth and/or lower
   mortality in the piglets suckling the `upper row' teats? We found that
   the pattern of grunting vocalisation emitted by the sow was highly
   repeatable both within and across lactations. We hypothesise that this
   individual acoustic signal may be used by piglets to locate their mother
   during synchronised nursings in the group living female pigs. However,
   the variables characterising nursing frequency, the willingness of the
   sow to allow udder massage by the piglets, and the laterality of nursing
   had low or no repeatabilities within and across lactations. Piglet
   growth was only loosely, and piglet mortality not at all, related to the
   quantitative variability in nursing behaviour casting doubts on whether
   nursing behaviour variables are suitable for selection programs.
   Although some sows preferred to nurse while lying on the left, and
   others on the right side, this laterality did not result in faster
   growth of piglets suckling the upper row of teats.}},

Abstract = {{Nest building and farrowing behaviour of 40 Landrace/Yorkshire (L/Y)
   sows was studied in their first and second parity. In the first parity
   the gilts were either housed in a crate or a ``get-away-pen{''} (GAP)
   and in the second parity either the same farrowing environment was used
   again or the sow was housed in the alternative system. The behaviour was
   compared with the behavioural reaction pattern of the same individuals
   in prepubertal tests (open field test, human-test, food competition
   test) and the reactivity in the HPA-axis during the open field test.
   Nest building behaviour was in both parities found to be more elaborated
   in the GAPs, where the prepartum rooting period started significantly
   sooner (32.5 +/- 3.0 h versus 41.3 +/- 3.0 h, F-1,F-27 = 5.72; P < 0.05
   and 27.4 +/- 3.3 h versus 35.6 +/- 3.1 h, F-1,F-27 = 4.33; P < 0.05,
   respectively) and had a longer duration (21.5 +/- 3.1 h versus 32.6 +/-
   3.1 h, F-1,F-27 = 8.33; P < 0.01 and 27.9 +/- 3.6 versus 38.7 +/- 3.4 h,
   F-1,F-27 = 6.57; P < 0.05, respectively). Farrowing behaviour was in the
   first parity strongly dependent upon the environment, e.g. the mean
   piglet birth interval was significantly longer in the crates (30 +/- 14
   min versus 19 +/- 3 min, F-1,F-21 = 5.55; P < 0.05), indicating an
   increased environmental sensitivity in gilts as compared to the second
   parity sows, where no environmental effect was found. Both farrowing and
   nest building behaviour, especially in the first parity, was connected
   to the prepubertal behavioural and physiological reaction pattern (1st
   parity-immobility in human-test \&SIM; activity during farrowing: r(s) =
   -0.49; P < 0.01, N = 38 and the quantity of postural changes in nest
   building period similar to rise in cortisol during open field test: r(s)
   = 0.44; P < 0.01, N = 35). Furthermore, there was a strong repeatability
   across parities in parameters describing activity during nest building
   and farrowing.
   The prepubertal gilts reacting behaviourally calm in a stressful
   situation were timing their nest building more optimally than the more
   actively responding individuals. Behavioural activity during prepubertal
   tests was also correlated with being active during farrowing. We
   therefore conclude that behaviour during nest building and farrowing is
   related to the general reaction pattern during stress, especially in
   inexperienced gilts, and that the performance reflects an innate pattern
   of reaction in the individual, that can be modified by the environment
   and previous experience. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. The concept of repeatability, the measurement of consistent
   individual differences, has become an increasingly important tool in
   evolutionary and ecological physiology. Significant repeatability
   facilitates the study of selection acting on natural populations and the
   concept has several practical implications for identifying traits.
   2. When properly defined and measured, repeatability can set the upper
   limit to heritability. This is potentially a very useful interpretation
   of the repeatability of traits measured on natural populations because
   often, estimates of heritability cannot be obtained. Many recent reports
   of repeatability of individual differences for traits have made this
   interpretation.
   3. However, repeatability estimates may not set an upper limit to
   heritability if: (a) measured traits are not genetically identical, (b)
   common environmental effects work in opposition to direct genetic
   effects, (c) the temporary environments for each trait are negatively
   correlated, (d) significant genotype-environment interaction is present,
   or (e) the traits are influenced by maternal effects.
   4. The quantitative genetic theory that defines the concept of
   repeatability is reviewed and implications of violations of the five
   assumptions are discussed in the context of interpreting repeatability
   as an upper estimate to heritability.}},

   metabolic rate, aggression, and competitive ability that were also
   repeatable over time. However, there was no relationship between
   competitive ability (measured as feeding attempts) and subsequent
   growth. This may be due to an energetic cost of dominance: high rates of
   food capture were only attainable through high rates of effort. This, in
   addition to elevated aggression, was thought to exert an energetic cost

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of
   repeated handling and the use of a mask on the order of entry,
   temperament, cortisol concentration and heart and respiratory rates of
   Brahman cattle during restraint in a squeeze chute. In the first
   experiment, 18 cows were restrained in the chute for 10 min on 19
   test-days and blood samples were collected during five of the trials.
   Habituation to handling was reflected by a decrease in cortisol
   concentration as the study advanced (P < 0.01). In the second
   experiment. conducted 6 months later, animals were randomly allotted to
   two groups, alternating the use of a mask over test-days while
   restraining the cows in the chute for 3 min, Respiratory and heart rates
   were measured at the beginning and end of each 3 min trial. A blood
   sample was also taken at the end of each trial. Respiratory rates
   decreased while the animals were restrained and this decrease tended to
   be greater (P = 0.09) when the animals were wearing masks (3.06) than
   when not (2.2 breaths/min). Heart rates also decreased and more so for
   masked animals (10.6 beats/min) than for non-masked (5.0, P < 0.01).
   Cortisol values tended to be higher (9.9 versus 4.7 ng/ml, P = 0.08)
   when animals were restrained without a mask. Temperament scores were
   lower (P > 0.01) when cows were masked and have a relative high
   correlation (r = 0.58) with flight distance values, (P < 0.05). Finally,
   the order of entrance was found consistent over test-days, (P < 0.01).
   It is concluded that Brahman cattle: (a) habituate to repeat handling in
   a squeeze chute; (b) are less emotionally reactive when their eyes were
   covered during this process and (c) establish a repeatable order of
   entrance to the chute. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Social impulsivity in response to a stranger was assessed in male vervet
   monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) using the Intruder Challenge
   Test. Vervets (N = 128, ages 3-18 years) were presented with an
   unfamiliar adult male at the periphery of the home enclosure. An index
   of impulsivity reflecting variation in the tendency to rapidly approach,
   engage, and challenge the intruder was derived from factor analysis of
   behavioral responses. Scale reliability (alpha = .84) and test-retest
   consistency (intraclass correlation = .83) were high, indicating that
   this index reliably and efficiently measures a stable aspect of
   temperament from impulsive to inhibited. Impulsivity scores peaked at
   age 4, when vervet males typically emigrate from the natal group. The
   highest ranking males in each group were more likely to score in the
   moderate range, whereas lower ranking males were more likely to score in
   the highest (impulsive) or lowest (inhibited) quartiles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A pilot study assessed the utility of the Timeline Followback
   (TLFB) method to collect information on help seeking.
   Method: Using the TLFB method, 34 clients (26 men) who had attended at
   least one session of an outpatient alcohol treatment program reported on
   treatment contacts. including any supplemental services (e.g.,
   psychiatric care). TLFB reports of help seeking at that agency were
   compared with agency records of treatment contacts.
   Results: Clients reported on their help-seeking behavior for a period of
   approximately 8 months after they had completed an initial assessment
   for the outpatient treatment With regard to the number of outpatient
   sessions they attended intraclass correlations and equivalence testing
   showed that the TLFB data were comparable to the agency records of
   treatment contacts. Analysis of week-to-week correspondence of the
   presence or absence of help-seeking episodes showed good agreement
   between TLFB and the agency records for most participants, although
   there was substantial variation. Degree of correspondence was not
   associated with the length of the recall period or individual
   differences (e.g., drinking pattern). Older participants, however,
   tended to have lower week-to-week concordance than did younger
   participants.
   Conclusions: These data provide preliminary support for the utility of a
   help-seeking TLFB instrument to assess addiction- and mental
   health-related contacts. This instrument may be especially useful in
   research in which collecting temporal patterns of help seeking is of
   interest (e.g., in studies examining factors influencing the delay in
   help seeking alter relapse).}},

   Atlantic colonies: foraging trip duration and foraging area fidelity}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{283-290}},
Abstract = {{Seabirds may be able to increase their foraging efficiency by learning
   the whereabouts of predictable sources of prey and returning repeatedly
   to these locations. The occurrence of such foraging area fidelity has
   been little studied, particularly for pelagic species. We used satellite
   telemetry to study foraging behaviour and foraging area fidelity of
   individual chick-rearing gannets in the North Sea (at the Bass Rock, SE
   Scotland) and in the Celtic Sea (at Great Saltee, SE Ireland), 2 areas
   that differ in the distribution of prey. Foraging ranges of adults
   covered a wide area of ocean up to a maximum range of 540 km at the Bass
   Rock and 240 km at Great Saltee. At the Bass Rock, individual birds
   foraged in a single direction or at most in 2 distinct directions, with
   very similar bearings on successive trips in each direction, significant
   differences in bearings between individuals and significant
   repeatability in distances travelled. These results strongly suggest
   that individuals learned and remembered the locations of feeding sites
   and used that knowledge on subsequent foraging trips. By contrast at
   Great Saltee, bearings of successive trips by individuals were much less
   similar, with highly variable distances to destinations, no differences
   in bearings among individuals and no significant repeatability in
   distance travelled. These results indicate a much lower degree of
   foraging area fidelity at Great Saltee, probably due to a more uniform
   or less predictable distribution of prey in the Celtic Sea than in the
   North Sea. Despite marked differences between colonies in distances to
   trip destinations, durations of foraging trips and foraging area
   fidelity, the behaviour of birds during foraging trips was very similar
   at the 2 sites; the average speed of travel during foraging trips was
   almost identical and birds at both colonies spent about half their time
   at sea in flight.}},

Abstract = {{Studies investigating the effect of rate of temperature change on
   thermal thresholds have used a variety of different methods and
   threshold combinations, and many display incomplete reporting of
   statistical analyses. It has been suggested that C- and A delta -fibre
   mediated thresholds differ in their reaction to different rates of
   temperature change. Ten healthy female volunteers (aged 18-26 years;
   mean 21 +/- S.D. 2.53) undertook cold sensation (CS), warm sensation
   (WS), cold pain (CP) and heat pain (HP) threshold determinations on the
   thenar eminence of the dominant hand. Rates of temperature change of
   0.5, 1, 2.5 and 4 degreesC/s were used, with a modified method of
   limits. Adaptation temperature was 32 degreesC and thermode size 3 cm x
   3 cm. Results showed a significant increase in WS, HP and CP thresholds
   with increased rates of temperature change (all p < 0.001), but no
   significant change for CS (p = 0.653). These results suggest that
   thresholds with a C-fibre component (WS, HP and CP) and those that are
   Ad-fibre mediated (CS) behave differently. A traditional explanation of
   measurement artefact alone is insufficient in rationalizing these
   results, with additional factors potentially involved. Slow rates of
   temperature change were shown to reduce mean intra-individual
   differences in recorded threshold values, and also to abolish ceiling
   effects with HP threshold determinations. Clinically, therefore, using
   slow rates of temperature change with method of limits has a range of
   benefits over and above simply minimizing measurement artefact.}},

Abstract = {{Male burying beetles attract females using a pheromonal signal and can
   provide parental care and a food resource, vertebrate carrion, for their
   developing offspring. But males attempt to attract females even when
   they have no carrion. We examined the factors that influence male
   behavior directed toward finding or attracting mates in both
   field-caught and laboratory-reared Nicrophorus orbicollis, a North
   American burying beetle. We investigated whether male behavior differed
   based on both intrinsic (size) and extrinsic (resources held)
   differences among males. Further, we examined repeatability of
   individual behaviors and the effect of holding or lacking resources on
   these repeatabilities. Field-caught and laboratory-reared individuals
   differed in overall activity but not in their behavioral repertoire,
   making studies of laboratory-reared males relevant The behavior of
   individual males was very consistent within a condition, but plastic
   between resource conditions. The frequency of calling (adopting a
   posture that indicates pheromone release to am-act females) depended on
   male size when males did not hold resources, but this relationship
   disappeared when males held resources. Without carrion, smaller males
   called more frequently than did larger males. When holding carrion,
   smaller males reduced their calling, whereas larger males significantly
   increased the frequency with which they attempted to attract females and
   reduced the amount of time they spent searching. Thus, calling behavior
   of males was conditional on not only intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
   but also an interaction between them. We suggest that the changes in
   calling represent alternative tactics based on the costs and benefits of
   attracting both potential mates and competitors, which differ for males
   of different sizes.}},

   displayed consistent, individually repeatable responses to the predation
   cues, including hiding (refuge use) and substratum avoidance (crawling
   to the water surface or out of the water). We assessed shell morphology
   using morphometric techniques that isolate geometrically independent
   components of size and shape variation corresponding to aperture width
   and apertural obstruction. Previous studies indicate that large size,
   narrow apertures and obstructed apertures reduce morphological
   vulnerability to the shell-entry predation tactics used by crayfish. In
   the present study, small, and thus more vulnerable, prey tended to show
   stronger antipredator behaviour than large prey (i.e. behavioural
   compensation for morphological vulnerability). In contrast, behavioural
   and shape-based defences were positively correlated; snails with narrow
   apertures showed strong antipredator responses. We refer to this `double

   Results: One in 433 (0.23\%) of the children in our series had evidence

   varied significantly, with behavioral thresholds ranging from normal to
   profound levels. Discrimination skills were also variable. Approximately

Abstract = {{Differences among individuals are necessary for natural selection to
   occur. The extent and expression of these differences can limit the
   power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals
   inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile
   traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their
   expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in
   their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the
   consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different
   environments or within a single environment; little is known about how
   repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To
   address this issue, we examined the consistency of antipredator
   behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A
   group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was
   repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of
   reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator
   display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each
   individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen
   to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field
   (15, 22.5, 30 degrees C). Temperature had substantial effects on the
   average expression of each behaviour;snakes crawled more slowly, for
   shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures.
   Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this
   consistency of expression was not affected by temperature. (C) 1999 The

Abstract = {{This is the first part of a multi-zoo study to analyze the effects of
   captive environments on black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) behavior,

   validity of a standardized method of cross-institutional assessment of
   the behavior of individual rhinoceros. In 1994 and 1995, we asked
   zookeepers at 19 toes to rate their black rhinoceros (a total of 60
   animals) on 52 behavior elements using a questionnaire. At 14 toes, at
   least two keepers rated all the black rhinoceros at their zoo. We used
   average differences in their ratings of the 52 behavior elements to
   determine the most reliably rated behavior elements. Fourteen elements
   were retained for further analysis. Based on their inter-correlations,
   we grouped these 14 behaviors into six behavior traits: olfactory
   behaviors, chasing/stereotypy/mouthing, friendly to keeper fearful,
   patrolling and dominant (to conspecifics). A behavior profile of each
   animal consisted of scores on these six traits that were the sum of the
   primary keeper's ratings for each element in the group. To test the
   validity of these profiles, we compared scores on the six traits to the
   behavior of each rhinoceros during a standardized test of reactivity to
   a novel object and a novel conspecific scent. Tests were videotaped and
   analyzed by one researcher. Frequencies and durations of behaviors
   observed during the tests were correlated with scores on all six rated
   behavior traits. Scores on friendly to keeper, dominant, and olfactory
   behaviors described differences between black rhinoceros of captive/wild

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of polyandry for sexual selection, the reasons
   why females frequently mate with several males remain poorly understood.
   A number of genetic benefits have been proposed, based on the idea that
   by taking multiple mates, females increase the likelihood that their
   offspring will be sired by genetically more compatible or superior
   males. If certain males have intrinsically ``good genes,{''} any female
   mating with them will produce superior offspring. Alternatively, if some
   males have genetic elements that are incompatible with a particular
   female, then she may benefit from polyandry if the sperm of such males
   are less likely to fertilize her eggs. We examined these hypotheses in
   the held cricket Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). By
   allocating females identical numbers of matings but different numbers of
   mates we investigated the influence of number of mates on female
   fecundity, and both short- and long-term offspring fitness. This
   revealed no effect of number of mates on number of eggs laid. However,
   hatching success of eggs increased with number of mates. This effect
   could not be attributed to nongenetic effects such as the possibility
   that polyandry reduces variance in the quantity or fertilizing ability
   of sperm females receive, because a control group receiving half the
   number of copulations showed no drop in hatching success. Offspring did
   not differ in survival, adult mass, size, or development time with
   treatment. When males were mated to several different females there were
   no repeatable differences between individual males in the hatching
   success of their mate's eggs. This suggests that improved hatching
   success of polyandrous females is not due to certain males having genes
   that improve egg viability regardless of their mate. Instead, our
   results support the hypothesis that certain males are genetically more
   compatible with certain females, and that this drives polyandry through
   differential fertilization success of sperm from more compatible males.}},

Abstract = {{In order to further assess the usefulness of behaviour as a possible
   selection criterion for the improvement of lamb-rearing ability, the
   arena behaviour of rams and ewes of a flock selected for rearing ability
   (Fertility Flock) was compared to that of rams and ewes of an unselected
   flock (Random Flock). Arena behaviour was measured in an
   approach/avoidance test wherein animals were placed alone in a narrow
   arena for 10 min. During this period, their attraction to a group of
   sheep in a pen at one end of the arena relative to their avoidance of a
   human being sitting in the arena in front of this pen was assessed by
   quantifying five behaviours; minimum, mean and maximum distance from the
   human, total distance moved in the arena and number of bleats. These
   behavioural measurements were made at 6, 12 and 20 months of age. Of the
   five behaviours measured, total distance travelled consistently differed
   between the two flocks, Fertility Flock animals travelling, on average,
   only 60\% as far as the Random Flock animals. Number of bleats also
   differed between the two flocks, but only at 6 and 12 months of age.
   Importantly, these differences appeared in both ewes and rams. The study
   also showed that these behaviours were all moderately to highly
   repeatable. These results further support the possible usefulness of
   arena behaviour as a means of genetically improving the lamb-rearing
   ability of ewes and indicate that rapid genetic progress may be possible
   since these behaviours can be measured early in the life of animals and
   in animals of both sixes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Studies concerning aggression after mixing unfamiliar pigs have shown
   that there is a great variability in the levels of aggression shown by
   individual pigs. This study examined whether individual aggressiveness
   can be measured in a resident-intruder situation and whether it is a
   stable characteristic of individuals, which does not simply reflect the
   age or sex class of the animal. These latter requirements are of
   fundamental importance in establishing the existence of individual
   personality or temperament characteristics in animals. The research was
   carried out in three datasets, with a total of 218 pigs, females and
   entire males, at the age of 7 and 11 weeks, For the test, individual
   pigs were isolated in one half of their home pen, and an intruder pig
   was introduced. This pig was 2-3 weeks younger than the resident pig.
   The time from when the resident first made contact to when it attacked
   the intruder pig was used as a measure of aggressiveness. If the
   resident did not attack, the test was terminated after 3.5 min. The test
   was repeatable across two consecutive days as well as across four weeks.
   Aggressiveness was found to be unrelated to characteristics of the test
   pigs, such as sex, age, body weight and body weight ranked within
   litter. Attack latency was not affected by the sex of the intruder pig,
   If the intruder was less than half the body weight of the test pig, it
   was less likely to be attacked. Considerable variation was found within
   as well as between litters, The importance of the nature of the test
   arena, and implications of the duration of the test are discussed, Using
   attack latency as a measure of aggressiveness and a relatively short
   time limit, the test provides a useful tool for measuring aggressiveness
   without compromising the welfare of the animals involved. (C) 1997

   Animals were reared individually from eggs through metamorphosis in the
   laboratory. Maximum swimming speed of tadpoles was measured
   metamorphosis (Gosner stage 37) and again at the onset of the
   metamorphic climax (stage 42). Maximum jump distance was measured on the

   Locomotor performance was repeatable over a 24h period for both
   premetamorphic tadpoles and juvenile frogs, Performance was not
   repeatable across metamorphosis or between any two of the three
   developmental stages investigated, A high-performance individual at one
   developmental stage does not necessarily retain that performance
   advantage at another stage. This lack of repeatability contrasts sharply

   channel, we found repeatable differences in downstream movement
   behaviour among newly emerged chinook fry. Fish that moved downstream
   were larger than those that held position in the channel. However, the
   incidence of downstream movement behaviours decreased over the first 2
   weeks after emergence. We propose that the variation among individuals

Abstract = {{To understand how individual differences in fertilization success arises
   in the fly Dryomyza anilis, variation in sperm precedence between and

   copulation followed by tapping sequences during which the male taps the
   external genitalia of the female. These tapping sequences increase last
   male sperm precedence. Each male in the experiment was repeatedly mated
   with a set of females. In the first treatment, mating was interrupted
   after the male had an intromission. In the second treatment, the male
   was allowed to perform five tapping sequences after an intromission. In
   the third treatment, the male was allowed to perform an unlimited number
   of tapping sequences after an intromission until interrupted by female
   resistance. There were large differences between males in all three
   treatments as shown by the 95\% confidence limits of the mean
   fertilization success. Repeatabilities of mating time and the number of
   tapping movements per tapping sequence were high indicating clear
   differences between males in these components of mating behaviour.
   Within individual males, the more tappings per sequence, the higher the

Abstract = {{We examined the possibility that the echolocation (sonar) signals used
   by big brown bats convey information beyond species identity (e.g.
   individual identity, family membership, age class, sex). The
   echolocation signals of six adult females, their 12 offspring, and eight
   additional offspring were recorded as bats performed a standardized
   laboratory target-detection task. Sonar signals were analysed for
   consistency within individuals, and for similarity within families,
   within age classes (adult versus juvenile), and within sex for
   juveniles. Evidence was found for individual distinctiveness of
   emissions, for resemblance of the sonar emissions used by different
   individuals within a family, and for differences between the emissions
   of adults and juveniles. No evidence was found for differences between
   the echolocation calls of juvenile males and females. Individual
   differences in sonar signals may allow a bat to identify other bats by
   their sonar calls and may also prevent jamming of the bat's sonar
   receiver. Similarity within families suggests a heritable component to
   call variation, although learning cannot be ruled out and is indeed
   suggested by the findings that the sonar signals of family members (a
   mother and her offspring) are more evenly distributed in
   cross-correlation space than expected by chance, and that heritability
   estimates are higher based on mother-offspring comparisons than on
   sibling-sibling comparisons. The finding that the emissions of juveniles
   differ from those of adults and that the repeatability of sonar signals
   improves with the age of the juvenile suggests that acquisition of a
   stable, adult-like signal requires several months, well beyond the time
   young start flying, at about 1 month. The ability to recognize other
   individuals or classify them by age and family on the basis of their
   echolocation calls could be important to bats in a number of social

Abstract = {{We investigated individual, nightly, and seasonal variation in calling
   behavior of a population of gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor) from
   Connecticut, USA. Repeated recordings of individual males on seven
   nights revealed significant differences among males in calling rate on
   all but one night and differences in number of pulses per call and
   number of pulses produced per hour (pulse effort) on four nights. Most
   males reduced calling activity late at night (after 2230 h), but some
   maintained a relatively steady rate of call production before dropping
   out of the chorus. Data collected for 26 individuals recorded on three
   or more nights throughout the breeding season revealed significant
   differences among males in calling rate, number of pulses per call, and
   pulse effort, but repeatabilities for all three variables were low
   (0.17, 0.35, and 0.12, respectively). The highest repeatability was for
   number of pulses per call, a variable strongly influenced by proximity
   to calling neighbors, probably because males often interacted with
   neighbors at similar distances on several successive nights. Males
   tended to reduce the number of pulses per call as the season progressed
   and the distance between neighbors decreased, but they showed no clear
   seasonal change in calling rate or pulse effort. There was a substantial
   seasonal decline in the number of hours of chorus activity, resulting in
   a median decrease of 43\% in nightly energy expenditure by calling
   males.}},

Abstract = {{Many violent crimes have been associated with alcohol intoxication, but
   experimental research in laboratory animals has been largely
   inconclusive on alcohol effects on aggression. A focus on individual
   differences rather than group statistics has revealed that low doses of
   ethanol cause large and repeatable increases in aggressive behavior in
   subgroups of rodents and primates. The recent progress using in vivo
   neuropharmacological techniques makes it feasible to explore differences
   in brain mechanisms in animals that show enhanced aggression after
   ethanol vs those that do not. Effects of ethanol on three major
   neurotransmitter systems (i.e. GABA, serotonin, dopamine) are examined.
   Since these neurotransmitter substances are critically important in the
   neurobiology of various kinds of aggressive behavior in rodent and
   primate species, they are potential mechanisms by which ethanol alters
   aggressive behavior. Direct research on the relevance of the
   physiological interaction between ethanol and the GABA receptor suggests
   that at least some of the effects of alcohol on aggression involve the
   GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The role of serotonin (5-HT)
   will have to be newly defined in light of the findings that ethanol
   increases 5-HT release in several forebrain areas, in a dose range that
   can stimulate aggressive behavior in a subgroup of individuals. Recent
   irt vivo studies show that acute exposure to ethanol increases dopamine
   release in discrete dopamine terminal areas, and that the initiation and
   execution of aggressive and defensive behavior are also synchronized
   with increased dopamine activity in these brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and
   validity of a new assessment instrument for positive and negative
   symptoms in severely disturbed children and adolescents (Kiddie-PANSS)
   Method: The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for adult schizophrenia
   was modified through successive field trials on the basis of
   developmental characteristics of children and adolescents. The scab was
   then given to 34 inpatients (19 children, mean age=9.35 years, and 15
   adolescents, mean age=14.33 years) with DSM-III-R diagnoses of
   schizophrenia; psychosis not otherwise specified schizoaffective,
   affective, conduct, personality, and developmental disorders determined
   independently by child psychiatrists. All patients with schizophrenia
   were placed in the schizophrenic group, and all others were placed in a
   general inpatient group. The Kiddie-PANSS ratings were given by three
   trained child psychiatrists after a 30-35-minute structured interview.
   The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, the Scale for the Assessment of
   Positive Symptoms, and the Scab for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
   were also administered in order to determine criterion-related
   association. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed that
   all subscales and total psychopathology were reliably assessed among
   raters. The Kiddie-PANSS and Scale for the Assessment of Positive
   Symptoms/Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms correlated with
   one another, indicating criterion-related association. Differences on
   measures of positive, negative, and general psychopathology, as measured
   by the Kiddie-PANSS, between the patients with schizophrenia and the
   general inpatient group were highly significant. Conclusion: The
   Kiddie-PANSS shows good interrater reliability and criterion-related
   validity. In a cohort of inpatient children and adolescents the scale
   successfully differentiated schizophrenic patients from nonschizophrenic
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Research in animals has only recently been successful in reliably
   mimicking the long-established link between alcohol and heightened
   aggressive behavior.  The present review highlights the large individual
   differences in die effects of acute low alcohol doses on aggressive
   behavior in rodent and primate species, paralleling the human condition.
   Subpopulations of both species show reliable and repeatable enhancement
   of aggressive behavior when administered low, acute alcohol doses.
   Statistical analysis of the temporal patterns of aggressive behavior
   indicate that alcohol prolongs aggressive bouts or `'bursts'' and
   increases the number of aggressive behaviors within each burst. However,
   the latency to initiate attack and the time between aggressive bursts
   are relatively unaltered by alcohol. These alcohol-induced increases in
   aggression can be potentiated by benzodiazepine agonists and prevented
   by antagonists. In addition, highly aggressive animals can be
   differentiated from nonaggressive ones at the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine
   receptor complex. These data suggest an important link between alcohol,
   aggression and the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in open-field activity and emotionality (number

   studied in 35 random bred male ICR mice. With the exception of latency
   in the open field and voluntary speed on a racetrack, all measurements
   were significantly repeatable on two successive trial days. Maximal
   oxygen consumption (corrected for body size) was positively correlated
   with amount of wheel running during each day of a 7-day test, and the
   correlation became stronger throughout the testing period; however, none
   of the daily correlations reached statistical significance. The first

Abstract = {{1. Using behaving monkeys, we studied the visual responses of single
   neurons in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus
   (LGN) to a set of two-dimensional black and white patterns. We found
   that monkeys could be trained to make sufficiently reliable and stable
   fixations to enable us to plot and characterize the receptive fields of
   individual neurons. A qualitative examination of rasters and a
   statistical analysis of the data revealed that the responses of neurons
   were related to the stimuli.
   2. The data from 5 of the 13 ``X-like{''} neurons in our sample
   indicated the presence of antagonistic center and surround mechanisms
   and linear summation of luminance within center and surround mechanisms.
   We attribute the lack of evidence for surround antagonism in the eight
   neurons that failed to exhibit center-surround antagonism either to a
   mismatch between the size of the pixels in the stimuli and the size of
   the receptive field or to the lack of a surround mechanism (i.e., the
   type II neurons of Wiesel and Hubel).
   3. The data from five other neurons confirm and extend previous reports
   indicating that the surround regions of X-like neurons can have
   nonlinearities. The responses of these neurons were not modulated when a
   contrast-reversing, bipartite stimulus was centered on the receptive
   field, which suggests a linear summation within the center and surround
   mechanisms. However, it was frequently the case for these neurons that
   stimuli of identical pattern but opposite contrast elicited responses of
   similar polarity, which indicates nonlinear behavior.
   4. We found a wide variety of temporal patterns in the responses of
   individual LGN neurons, which included differences in the magnitude,
   width, and number of peaks of the initial on-transient and in the
   magnitude of the later sustained component. These different temporal
   patterns were repeatable and clearly different for different visual
   patterns. These results suggest that visual information may be carried
   in the shape as well as in the amplitude of the response waveform.}},
