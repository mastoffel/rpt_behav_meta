  abstract={Many studies have revealed repeatable (among-individual) variance in behavioural traits consistent with variation in animal personality; however, these studies are often conducted using data collected over single sampling periods, most commonly with short time intervals between observations. Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study, overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g. lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and, at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual performance change significantly between data sets.},

  abstract={Outbreaking insects are often considered identical units despite recent work in behavioural ecology that shows repeatable differences can exist between individuals and can have important implications for individual fitness and population processes. However, although entomologists have neglected the hypothesis that differences between individuals can play an important role in the ecology of a species, it is not new. Wellington (1957. Can. J. Zool. 35: 293-323) suggested that consistent individual differences in behaviour may play a role in the population dynamics of Malacosoma (Hubner, 1820) species (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae). We used a novel approach to determine if individual larval Malacosoma disstria Hubner, 1820 exhibit distinct and repeatable behavioural traits. Second-instar caterpillars were placed on individual arenas for I h on 4 consecutive days, and the proportion of time spent walking, searching, quiescent, and eating was documented. Active and sluggish behavioural types were distinguished and stable differences in individual activity were observed. Activity was positively correlated with growth during the 4 days of the experiment, but no significant relationship was detected between behaviour during the experiment and overall larval performance in the laboratory setting. These findings demonstrate consistent variation in the foraging behaviour of forest tent caterpillars and lay the basis for further investigatison of its role in colony function and population dynamics.},

Here, we document a field and laboratory experiment that examines the consistency of measures of boldness, activity, and aggressive behavior in the young of a tropical reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) immediately following their transition between pelagic larval and benthic juvenile habitats. Newly-settled fish were observed in aquaria and in the field on replicated patches of natural habitat cleared of resident fishes. Seven behavioral traits representing aspects of boldness, activity and aggression were monitored directly and via video camera over short (minutes), medium (hours), and long (3 days) time scales. With the exception of aggression, these behaviors were found to be moderately or highly consistent over all time scales in both laboratory and field settings, implying that these fish show stable personalities within various settings. Our study is the first to examine the temporal constancy of behaviors in both field and laboratory settings in over various time scales at a critically important phase during the life cycle of a reef fish.},

  abstract={The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) concept predicts that individuals with high baseline metabolic rates demonstrate high boldness, aggressiveness, and activity, especially in food acquisition, with associated relatively greater energy requirements. In fishes, these behaviors may increase individual vulnerability to angling. To test the predictions of the POLS concept, we quantified individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and boldness in both wild-caught and hatchery-reared Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). We found both SMR and boldness to be repeatable traits but detected no correlation between them. Individual vulnerability to angling was assessed in the hatchery-reared perch, but we found no difference in boldness or SMR between vulnerable and nonvulnerable perch. Wild-caught perch were ice fished using either natural or artificial bait, and we observed no differences in boldness or SMR with respect to bait type or capture order. Our findings do not support the predictions of the POLS concept and, consistent with earlier studies in perch, suggest that angling may not drive selection against boldness in this species.},

More exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity.},

  abstract={Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity. However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations.},

  abstract={Establishing behavioural repeatability is important in animal personality research; however, a range of factors can influence repeatability. Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after 2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability; however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality research.},

  abstract={Dairy cows' emotional state can sometimes be inferred from their behaviour, for example previous studies have suggested that those passing a novel person to the right are more likely to be anxious than those passing to the left. We undertook two studies of cow behaviour as they passed a novel person, to validate these behaviours as emotional indicators, in addition to determining correlations to other indices of emotional state. Cows passing to the right were more likely to have a raised or tucked tail, sniff the ground, walk slowly and a faster exit when put in a crush, compared with those passing to the left, which had their ears held forwards. From a principal component analysis, it was determined that cows passing on the right side were also most likely to pass without turning their head towards the person, pass singly and defecate whilst passing. However, those passing to the left side were most likely to turn to look at the person and pass in pairs. Cows with high milk yields were more likely to pass on the right side. Measurements of side of passage were repeatable between experiments but those of ear position were not. It is concluded that side of passage past a person correlates with other behavioural indicators of the cow's emotional state, with those passing to the right (i.e. left eye/right brain hemisphere) apparently more anxious. Evidence was also provided that high yielding cows are more anxious, as assessed by right side passage. With further validation, side of passage past a person could be developed as a simple measure of emotional state in dairy cows that can be conducted under field conditions.},

  abstract={The developmental perspectives of animal personality enhance our understanding of how personality structure changes in relation to life stage. Clonal animals are ideal models for developmental studies because personality differences can be solely attributed to environmental factors. Here, I investigated the presence of personality within a species of clonal gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, at different developmental stages. For juveniles and adult geckos, I measured exploration (reaction to a novel situation) and boldness (risk-prone tendency) and evaluated repeatability and correlation of these behavioural traits. Each gecko exhibited different exploration and boldness with significant repeatability through time but no correlation between these behavioural traits. Small juveniles were composed of only bold and low explorative individuals but large juveniles and adults were composed of various personality type individuals. These results demonstrate that subject geckos have a similar personality structure across life stages and that exploration and boldness are independent personality without forming behavioural syndrome structure. Biased composition of personality type between life stages suggests that appearance of different personality type individuals during an early ontogenetic stage generates personality variation within the clonal population. This study provides developmental insight about personality structure and its composition in clonal animals living in the wild.},

  abstract={Behavioural consistency within and across behaviours (animal personality and behavioural syndrome, respectively) has been vigorously studied in the last decade, leading to the emergence of animal personality research. It has been proposed recently that not only mean behaviour (behavioural type), but the environmentally induced behavioural change (behavioural plasticity) might also differ between individuals within populations. While case studies presenting between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity have started to accumulate, the mechanisms behind its emergence are virtually unknown. We have recently demonstrated that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli during ontogeny are necessary for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes. However, it is unknown whether between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity is hard-wired or induced. Here, we tested whether experience with predation during development affected predator-induced behavioural plasticity in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We ran a common garden experiment with two ontogenetic predation treatments: tadpoles developed from hatching in either the presence or absence of olfactory predator stimuli. Then, we assayed all tadpoles repeatedly for activity and risk-taking both in the absence and presence of olfactory predator stimuli. We found that (a) between-individual variation in predator-induced behavioural plasticity was present only in the group that developed in the presence of olfactory stimuli from predators and (b) previous experience with predatory stimuli resulted in lower plastic response at the group level. The latter pattern resulted from increased between-individual variation and not from universally lower individual responses. We also found that experience with predation during development increased the predictability (i.e. decreased the within-individual variation unrelated to environmental change) of activity, but not risk-taking. In line with this, tadpoles developing under perceived predatory risk expressed their activity with higher repeatability. We suggest that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli are not only fundamental for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes, but also for individual variation in behavioural plasticity. Thus, experience is of central importance for the emergence of individual behavioural variation at many levels.},

We have addressed this question by examining individual performances across multiple experiments with the same population of primates. We compiled a dataset spanning 16 social learning studies (26 experimental conditions) carried out at the same study site over a 12-year period, incorporating a total of 167 chimpanzees. We applied a binary scoring system to code each participant's performance in each study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not (Social Information Score-'SIS'). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age, prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females were, depending on their rearing history, 15-24\% more likely to use social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However, there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience, and pedigree records indicated that SIS was not a strongly heritable trait. Our study offers a novel, transferable method for the study of individual differences in social learning.},

  abstract={Studies about personalities in wild animals usually focus on five categories of behavioral traits that do not easily accommodate all aspects of parental care, a class of behaviors with direct consequence to reproductive success. Parental care can vary consistently between individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that, depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent, suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking parenting styles to fitness in swallow species.},

Specifically, we measure exploratory behavior of individual fish in an open field test over five weeks. We quantified the stationary time, average swimming speed and time spent by a fish in the center area. We found a number of strain differences for each behavioral measure. Stationary time was the most repeatable and reliable measure for assessing proactive-reactive behavioral differences. Reactive zebrafish generally showed the highest reliability and repeatability of exploratory behavior compared to proactive zebrafish and a separate wild caught strain.

Site fidelity, where individuals consistently use the same foraging site, is common among marine predators. Sex differences in foraging are also well studied in marine vertebrates, but the extent to which consistent inter-individual differences in foraging vary between the sexes is poorly known. Here we quantified the effects of sex on individual foraging site fidelity (IFSF), both within and between years, in chick-brooding Campbell albatross Thalassarche impavida. Using bird-borne global positioning system loggers, we calculated route fidelity (nearest-neighbour distance), repeatability of site fidelity (terminal latitude and longitude), and foraging effort (total distance travelled and trip duration) during 2 to 10 repeat trips. Overall, Campbell albatrosses showed a high degree of site fidelity. Birds travelled to similar sites not only within the same year, but also between 2 consecutive years, suggesting that the within-year consistency is not simply in response to short-term patches of food. Moreover, within the same year, we found differences in terms of IFSF between the sexes. Females that foraged closer to the colony in neritic and shelf waters were more likely to follow similar routes on repeated foraging trips and were more consistent in their foraging effort than males. Males that foraged further offshore in pelagic waters had more repeatable foraging longitudes than females. Our study provides further evidence of the importance of IFSF among marine vertebrates. However, it also reveals that the strength of such specialisations may vary with sex.},

  abstract={Individuals within the same population generally differ among each other not only in their behavioral traits but also in their level of behavioral plasticity (i.e., in their propensity to modify their behavior in response to changing conditions). If the proximate factors underlying individual differences in behavioral plasticity were the same for any measure of plasticity, as commonly assumed, one would expect plasticity to be repeatable across behaviors and contexts. However, this assumption remains largely untested. Here, we conducted an experiment with sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) whose behavioral plasticity was estimated both as the change in their personality traits or mating behavior across a social gradient and using their performance on a reversal-learning task. We found that the correlations between pairwise measures of plasticity were weak and non-significant, thus indicating that the most plastic individuals were not the same in all the tests. This finding might arise because either individuals adjust the magnitude of their behavioral responses depending on the benefits of plasticity, and/or individuals expressing high behavioral plasticity in one context are limited by neural and/or physiological constraints in the amount of plasticity they can express in other contexts. Because the repeatability of behavioral plasticity may have important evolutionary consequences, additional studies are needed to assess the importance of trade-offs between conflicting selection pressures on the maintenance of intra-individual variation in behavioral plasticity.},

  abstract={Variation in behavioral traits among individuals within a population can have implications for food webs and ecosystems. Temperature change also alters food web structure and function, but potential interactions between warming and intraspecific behavioral variation are largely unexplored. We aimed to test how increased temperature, individual activity level of a predatory backswimmer (Anisops assimilis), and their interaction influenced the strength of top-down control of zooplankton and phytoplankton. We used stable isotopes to support our assumption that the study population of A.assimilis is zooplanktivorous, and behavioral trials to confirm that activity level is a repeatable trait. We established freshwater microcosms to test for effects of warming, backswimmer presence, and backswimmer behavioral type on zooplankton density, zooplankton composition, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a. Top-down control was present and was generally stronger at increased temperature. There was no indication that predator behavioral type influenced the strength of top-down control either on its own or interactively with temperature. Predator behavioral type may not be associated with ecologically important function in this species at the temporal and spatial scales addressed in this study, but the links between behavior, temperature, and food web processes are worthy of broader exploration.},

  abstract={In the animal kingdom, behavioral variation among individuals has often been reported. However, stable among-individual differences along a behavioral continuumreflective of personality variationhave only recently become a key target of research. While a vast body of descriptive literature exists on animal personality, hypothesis-driven quantitative studies are largely deficient. One of the main constraints to advance the field is the lack of suitable model organisms. Here, we explore whether N.furzeri could be a valuable model to bridge descriptive and hypothesis-driven research to further unravel the causes, function and evolution of animal personality. As a first step toward this end, we perform a common garden laboratory experiment to examine if behavioral variation in the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri reflects personality divergence. Furthermore, we explore if multiple behavioral traits are correlated. We deliver proof of principle of personality variation among N.furzeri individuals in multiple behavioral traits. Because of the vast body of available genomic and physiological information, the well-characterized ecological background and an exceptionally short life cycle, N.furzeri is an excellent model organism to further elucidate the causes and implications of behavioral variation in an eco-evolutionary context.},

  abstract={Behavioural tendencies vary consistently among individuals and this variation is known as personality. Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Animals living in groups can show substantial variation in social traits and this affects their social organization. However, as the specific mechanisms driving this organization are difficult to identify in already organized groups typically found in the wild, the contribution of interindividual variation to group level behaviour remains enigmatic. Here, we present results of an experiment to create and compare groups that vary in social organization, and study how individual behaviour varies between these groups. We iteratively sorted individuals between groups of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by ranking the groups according to their directional alignment and then mixing similar groups. Over the rounds of sorting the consistency of the group rankings increased, producing groups that varied significantly in key social behaviours such as collective activity and group cohesion. The repeatability of the underlying individual behaviour was then estimated by comparing the experimental data to simulations. At the level of basic locomotion, individuals in more coordinated groups displayed stronger interactions with the centre of the group, and weaker interactions with their nearest neighbours. We propose that this provides the basis for a passive phenotypic assortment mechanism that may explain the structures of social networks in the wild.

We tested the effect of rearing environment (captive raised common-garden versus wild caught) and population origin (range-edge versus range-front) on the responses of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) to repeated exploration and risk-taking assays in captivity. We found that behavioural responses to identical assays performed on two occasions were complex and showed few consistent patterns based on rearing environment or population of origin. However, behavioural traits were repeatable across Trial Blocks when all sample populations were grouped together, indicating general consistency in individual toad behaviour across repeated behavioural assays. Our findings exemplify the complexity and unpredictability of behavioural responses and their effects on the repeatability and interpretation of behavioural traits across repeated behavioural assays in captivity. To meaningfully interpret the results from repeated behavioural assays, we need to consider how multiple factors may affect behavioural responses to these tests and importantly, how these responses may affect the repeatability of behavioural traits across time.},

Behavioral variation is known to influence animal invasions, yet comparatively less is known about how behavioral variation influences invasive-native species interactions. Here we examined how the mean and variance surrounding several behavioral traits in two sympatric species of praying mantis differ and how these behavioral types translate to actual prey capture success using the introduced European mantis, Mantis religiosa, and the native bordered mantis, Stagmomantis limbata. We assayed time spent in the open (risk proneness), response towards a novel prey, and voracity within a population of M. religiosa and S. limbata. We found that the native and invasive mantids displayed no differences in their average behavioral tendencies. The native exhibited significant levels of repeatability in voracity while the invasive did not. The lack of repeatability in the invasive appears to be driven by lower levels of among-individual variation in voracity. This may have evolutionary consequences for native S. limbata if it results in strong selection in native levels of mean and among-individual variation. Significant levels of among-individual differences were found in other behaviors (response to a novel prey and risk proneness) across species, suggesting less selection on invasive behavioral variation in these traits. Risk proneness and response towards a novel prey also formed a behavioral syndrome across species, yet neither behavior was correlated with voracity in either species. Our results illustrate the need to examine the ecological effects of behavioral variation of both invasive and native species to determine how that might impact invasive-native interactions.},

  abstract={Animals often show correlated suites of consistent behavioural traits, i.e., personality or behavioural syndromes. Does this conflict with potential phenotypic plasticity which should be adaptive for animals facing various contexts and situations? This fundamental question has been tested predominantly in studies which were done in non-breeding contexts and under laboratory conditions. Therefore, in the present study we examined the temporal stability of behavioural correlations in a breeding context and under natural conditions. We found that in the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) females, the intensity of their nest defence formed a behavioural syndrome with two other traits: their aggression during handling (self-defence) and stress responses during handling (breath rate). This syndrome was stable across the nesting cycle: each of the three behavioural traits was highly statistically repeatable between egg and nestling stages and the traits were strongly correlated with each other during both the egg stage and the nestling stage. Despite this consistency (i.e., rank order between stages) the individual behaviours changed their absolute values significantly during the same period. This shows that stable behavioural syndromes might be based on behaviours that are themselves unstable. Thus, syndromes do not inevitably constrain phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that the observed behavioural syndrome is the product of interactions between behavioural and life history trade-offs and that crucial proximate mechanisms for the plasticity and correlations between individual behaviours are hormonally-regulated.},

We encourage researchers to test additional sites to assess the generality of our results. Boldness decreased with crab size at the less disturbed sites, while no relationship between size and boldness was found at the disturbed site. Boldness increased with habitat disturbance, perhaps because bolder crabs succeed in exploiting food around people. Repeatability and plasticity were similar across sites. We hypothesize that population differences may be the result of developmental plasticity when aquatic larvae settle on a beach or selection for boldness at the disturbed site acting on each new generation.},

The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for the records of temperament testing that are used to improve the temperament of Jeju crossbred (JejuxThoroughbred) horses. Methods: This study was conducted using 205 horses (101 females and 104 males) produced between 2010 and 2015. The experimental animals were imprinted and tamed according to the Manual for Horse Taming and Evaluation for Therapeutic Riding Horses and evaluated according to the categories for temperament testing (gentleness, patience, aggressiveness, sensitivity, and friendliness) between 15 months and 18 months of age. Each category was scored on a five-point linear scale. Genetic parameters for the test categories were analyzed using a multi-trait mixed model with repeated records. The ASReml program was used to analyze the data. Results: The heritability of gentleness, patience, aggressiveness, sensitivity and friendliness ranged from 0.08 to 0.53. The standard errors of estimated heritability ranged from 0.13 to 0.17. The test categories showed high genetic correlations with each other, ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 and high repeatability, ranging from 0.70 to 0.73. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the test categories had moderate heritability and high genetic correlations, but additional studies may be necessary to use the results for the improvement programs of the temperament of Jeju crossbred horses.},

  abstract={Despite the growing evidence for the importance of developmental experiences shaping consistent individual differences in behaviour and physiology, the role of endocrine factors underlying the development and maintenance of such differences across multiple traits, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks. Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive period for behavioural development.},

In mangrove habitats on Long Caye, Belize, salinity varied widely over short distances from 20.941.7 parts per thousand over a 90 cm distance. In the lab, fish were exposed to an acute change in salinity of delta 10, 20, or 30 parts per thousand. Oxygen consumption significantly decreased in response to a 10 parts per thousand decrease in salinity and increased when salinity was elevated by 30 parts per thousand. Activity levels significantly increased with an increase in salinity (delta 20 and 30 parts per thousand). Individuals showed repeatable differences in both oxygen consumption rates and activity levels. Together, our data show that K. marmoratus is highly responsive to abrupt increases in salinity. Thus, movements made by K. marmoratus between temporary pools in the mangrove forest will acutely alter behavior and possibly metabolism, with many potential ecological consequences.},

Yet the factors driving variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion. Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ. Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of 36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range: 0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on T-set did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of T-set considerably more plausible.},

Preference for the enriched environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.62-0.98) turtles.

Selection latency did not differ between rearing treatments (P = 0.871). We conducted a second experiment to clarify if preferences were based on familiarity or novelty by using the same enclosure, but we gave individuals a choice between the habitat representing their rearing condition and a novel object (empty tissue box). Preference for respective rearing environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.98) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) individuals. Selection latency did not differ based on side chosen (P = 0.439) or rearing treatment (P = 0.764). Selection latency was repeatable by individuals (R = 0.47, 90\% CI = 0.24-0.71, P = 0.003), and this personality trait may be heritable since it was also repeatable by clutch mates (R = 0.36, 90\% CI = 0.03-0.62, P = 0.001). Preference for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior experience. Housing this species in enriched enclosures should increase welfare.

  abstract={Structures such as nests and burrows are an essential component of many organisms' life-cycle and require a complex sequence of behaviours. Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We found a general decline in investment in cell construction and provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r0.15), and traits were loosely organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of independent evolutionary trajectories.},

Most research with sounds in elasmobranchs has focused on hearing thresholds and attractiveness to sound sources, but very little is known about their abilities to learn about sounds, especially in benthic species. Here we investigated if juvenile Port Jackson sharks could learn to associate a musical stimulus with a food reward, discriminate between two distinct musical stimuli, and whether individual personality traits were linked to cognitive performance. Five out of eight sharks were successfully conditioned to associate a jazz song with a food reward delivered in a specific corner of the tank. We observed repeatable individual differences in activity and boldness in all eight sharks, but these personality traits were not linked to the learning performance assays we examined. These sharks were later trained in a discrimination task, where they had to distinguish between the same jazz and a novel classical music song, and swim to opposite corners of the tank according to the stimulus played. The sharks' performance to the jazz stimulus declined to chance levels in the discrimination task. Interestingly, some sharks developed a strong side bias to the right, which in some cases was not the correct side for the jazz stimulus.},
