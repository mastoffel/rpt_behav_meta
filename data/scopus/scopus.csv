Characteristic behaviors of different personality types (e.g. stress coping styles) are generally consistent across contexts and time. Here, we compare the repeatability and reliability of exploratory behaviors between zebrafish strains selectively bred to display contrasting behavioral responses to stressors that represent the proactive-reactive axis. Specifically, we measure exploratory behavior of individual fish in an open field test over five weeks. We quantified the stationary time, average swimming speed and time spent by a fish in the center area. We found a number of strain differences for each behavioral measure. Stationary time was the most repeatable and reliable measure for assessing proactive-reactive behavioral differences. Reactive zebrafish generally showed the highest reliability and repeatability of exploratory behavior compared to proactive zebrafish and a separate wild caught strain. Given the increased interest in the evolutionary consequences and proximate mechanisms of consistent individual differences, it will be important to continue to investigate how different selective pressures may influence expression of stress coping styles and their effects on the consistency of an animal’s behavior. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"animal experiment; article; controlled study; exploratory behavior; nonhuman; open field test; reliability; strain difference; stress; swimming speed; zebra fish","Wong, R.Y.; Department of Biology, University of Nebraska OmahaUnited States; email: rwong@unomaha.edu",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,,"English","Sci.

Variation among individuals is a necessary condition for the evolution through natural selection and inter-individual behavioural differences may be selected in different environmental situations. We tested whether individuals of two freshwater turtle species, Emys orbicularis and Mauremys leprosa, show consistent risk-taking behaviour when exposed to the presence of a potential predator. In an outdoor experimental setting, we simulated a predatory attack by overturning a turtle onto its carapace and recording three different behavioural response variables. Our results showed clear differences between species. The appearance time was highly consistent over the trials for both species, but was shorter for E. orbicularis and very long for M. leprosa. Waiting time was consistent only for females of E. orbicularis while M. leprosa did not show repeatability and had significantly longer waiting times. The number of failed righting attempts, likely being partially dependent on turtle individual performance, was highly consistent during the experiment for both species. The hiding behaviour in both species of freshwater turtles was consistent over time and, therefore, could be regarded as a personality trait. However, the differences in waiting times consistency suggested possible differences in defensive strategies between sexes and species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-predator trials; Emys orbicularis; Hiding behaviour; Mauremys leprosa; Personality traits; Righting efficiency","Animalia; Emys orbicularis; Mauremys leprosa; Testudines","Pellitteri-Rosa, D.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra e dell'Ambiente, Università di Pavia, Via Ferrata 9, Italy; email: masterfauna@unipv.it",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,,"English","Behav.

This is predicted to favour bolder and more aggressive individuals together with greater flexibility in behaviour. Previous work has focussed primarily on studying these traits in captive birds and has shown increased aggression and reduced consistency between traits (behavioural syndromes) in birds from urban populations. However, personality (consistency within a behavioural trait) has not been well studied in the wild. Here we tested whether urban free-living male great tits show greater territorial aggression than rural counterparts. We also tested predictions that both behavioural syndromes and personality would show lower consistency in urban populations. We found that urban populations were more aggressive than rural populations and urban birds appeared to show lower levels of individual behavioural repeatability (personality) as predicted. However, we found no effect of urbanisation on behavioural syndromes (correlations between multiple behavioural traits). Our results indicate that urban environments may favour individuals which exhibit increased territorial aggression and greater within-trait flexibility which may be essential to success in holding urban territories. Determining how urban environments impact key fitness traits will be important in predicting how animals cope with ongoing urbanisation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,,"Hardman, S.I.; Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences, Aberystwyth UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: samuelhardman@hotmail.com",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,,"English","Sci.

Over the last decades coping style has been linked to the development of research on animal personality. Based on this concept, we should find a proactive-reactive continuum in animal populations, with proactive individuals being fast explorer, bold, aggressive, and show high sympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate), as well as low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (PHA) axis reactivity to external stressor (higher plasma glucocorticoid level). At the other extreme, shy, lowly aggressive, reactive individuals should be slow in their exploration, and show a low sympathetic reactivity and a high HPA axis reactivity. However, a recent two-tier model proposed that coping style and stress reactivity should be independent of each other. In this study, we tested the two-tier model in a wild plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) population on the Tibetan Plateau, by quantifying the associations between several behavioural and physiological traits at the among- and within-individual levels. We repeatedly measured exploration, docility, boldness, heart rate and plasma cortisol concentration in individuals between April and September of 2013. All traits tested were repeatable. At the among-individual level, all behavioural traits were correlated with each other and with heart rate, but were independent of both basal level and variation of plasma cortisol concentration. Most correlations were negligible at the within-individual level. In support of the two-tier model, these results suggest that coping style (i.e. behaviour and heart rate associations) is independent of stress reactivity (i.e. glucocorticoid reactivity) in that species. © 2018","Coping styles; Personality; Plateau pika; Stress reactivity; Tibetan Plateau","hydrocortisone; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal trapping; Article; body mass; controlled study; coping behavior; exploratory behavior; heart rate; hydrocortisone blood level; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; mammal; nonhuman; Ochotona curzoniae; priority journal; stress","Qu, J.; Key Laboratory of Adaptation and Evolution of Plateau Biota, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: jpqu@nwipb.cas.cn",,"Elsevier Inc.",00319384,,PHBHA,"30236525","English","Physiol.

Research on animal personality has therefore received considerable attention, yet some methodological issues remain unresolved. We tested whether assessing personality by coding common behaviours is as time-consuming method as some researchers believe it to be. Altogether, 300 hours of observation were collected on 20 captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). We first examined the repeatability of behavioural indices that represented the behavioural repertoire of cotton-top tamarins. We then compared the personality structures, based on different lengths of observation time, of these behavioural indices. The minimum observational time necessary to obtain a stable personality structure was 5 to 7 hours per individual. This stable structure included two components: Extraversion and Confidence, which were similar to those described in great apes, Old World monkeys, and other New World monkeys. Our findings suggest that, at least in the case of cotton-top tamarins, behavioural coding over relatively short periods of time can be used to assess personality and that longer observation periods may yield diminishing returns. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animal personality; Behavioural observation; Callitrichidae; Consistency; Continuous focal recording","assessment method; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; individual variation; primate; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; behavioral observation; Cercopithecidae; comparative study; extraversion; female; male; nonhuman; personality; personality assessment; Platyrrhini; Saguinus; Saguinus oedipus; social behavior; social interaction; Animalia; Callitrichidae; Cercopithecidae; Hominidae; Platyrrhini; Saguinus oedipus","Masilkova, M.; Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, Branišovská 1760, Czech Republic; email: michaela.masilkova@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,,"English","Behav.

It has been proposed that consistent individual differences in metabolism could be related to inter-individual variation in behaviour and development throughout life. Here, we tested this idea in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), by investigating whether embryonic heart rate (a proxy for metabolic rate) is associated with prenatal developmental rates, post-natal activity levels and post-natal growth rates. Embryonic heart rate and post-natal activity level were significantly repeatable throughout an individual's development, such that consistent individual differences in these traits could be distinguished. We detected a significant, negative relationship between embryonic heart rate and incubation duration. However, we did not detect any relationship between embryonic heart rate, post-natal activity levels or post-natal growth rates. Our findings are significant because they identify consistent individual differences in embryonic metabolic phenotype and post-natal traits. However, we were unable to identify any correlation between the pre- and post-natal phenotypes suggesting that either intrinsic metabolic differences do not persist across the developmental boundary of hatching or such differences become obscured by parental or environmental effects after hatching. Our findings raise a number of questions about possible selection on metabolic phenotypes, both before and after hatching, and why developmental trajectories before and after hatching are apparently unlinked. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","behaviour; consistent individual differences; incubation duration; inter-individual variation; metabolic rate; ontogenic boundaries","Taeniopygia guttata","Sheldon, E.L.; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie UniversityAustralia; email: elizabeth-louise.sheldon@students.mq.edu.au",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055445203

More and more studies have investigated correlations between behaviour(s) and other phenotypic traits, thereby seeking to understand among-individual variation in behaviour from either a proximate or an ultimate perspective. Statistically, such studies require the estimation of among-individual correlations, necessitating study designs where suites of labile traits are repeatedly assayed. Most published studies, by contrast, instead assume that among-individual correlations can be approximated using data of suites of phenotypic traits measured only once. Such studies take an ‘individual gambit’ as they assume that phenotypic correlations between two traits measured once match among-individual correlations. A literature survey shows that this assumption was made in 62% of empirical studies; this is a worrying trend as a mismatch between the research question and the study (or statistical) design can lead to biased conclusions about biological patterns. In this paper we use a visual approach to illustrate these concerns for a broad audience, thereby complementing previous papers using a jargon more suitable for the statistically oriented. We thereby seek to reiterate the notion that reliable answers to any scientific question require specific types of data. While this commentary underlines the importance of spelling out key assumptions in discussions of (suboptimal) data in scientific papers on individuality, our main message is that researchers should typically be able to avoid publishing studies with conclusions heavily hinging on unverifiable assumptions. This is because researchers normally have the freedom to decide a priori to focus their research towards questions for which appropriate data can arguably be collected. Doing so would greatly facilitate our ability to robustly address key questions of biological interest, such as the ecology and evolution of individuality. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","among-individual variation; animal behaviour; animal personality; correlation; individual gambit; repeatability","Animalia","Niemelä, P.T.; Behavioural Ecology, Department of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of MunichGermany; email: petri.t.niemela@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is important in managing a subject’s stress prior to the onset of behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture “normal” behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject’s responses between observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after 2 h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish exposed to 10 min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability; however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to commencing research. Significance statement: Animal personality is individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2 h of acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality research. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Activity; Behavioural plasticity; Emergence; Methodology; Personality; Population","Animalia; Poecilia reticulata","Tosetto, L.; Macquarie UniversityAustralia; email: louise.tosetto@mq.edu.au",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95% CI: 0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity. © The Author (2017).

However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (Rs = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (Rs = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/ exploration (Rs = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (Rs = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations. © 2018 Foris et al.",,"adult; animal experiment; article; dairy cattle; female; Holstein cattle; male; movement time; nonhuman; personality; principal component analysis; social environment","Melzer, N.; Institute of Genetics and Biometry, Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal BiologyGermany; email: melzer@fbn-dummerstorf.de",,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"30273367","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054091051

Yet, while there is a vast literature on repeatable individual differences in behaviour, relatively little is known about the repeatability of cognitive performance. To further our understanding of the evolution of cognition, we gathered 44 studies on individual performance of 25 species across six animal classes and used metaanalysis to assess whether cognitive performance is repeatable. We compared repeatability (R) in performance (1) on the same task presented at different times (temporal repeatability), and (2) on different tasks that measured the same putative cognitive ability (contextual repeatability). We also addressed whether R estimates were influenced by seven extrinsic factors (moderators): type of cognitive performance measurement, type of cognitive task, delay between tests, origin of the subjects, experimental context, taxonomic class and publication status. We found support for both temporal and contextual repeatability of cognitive performance, with mean R estimates ranging between 0.15 and 0.28. Repeatability estimates were mostly influenced by the type of cognitive performance measures and publication status. Our findings highlight the widespread occurrence of consistent inter-individual variation in cognition across a range of taxa which, like behaviour, may be associated with fitness outcomes.

For the first time, we provide evidence for highly consistent individual differences in associative learning speed in fish. We characterized the same individuals for boldness in two experimental situations (latency to emerge from shelter and freezing time after a simulated predator attack) and found high behavioural repeatability. When we tested for a potential correlation between associative learning speed and boldness, however, there was no evidence for a link between them. Our study design included several steps to avoid typical pitfalls of disadvantaging shy individuals during learning tests. We caution that other experimental studies may have suffered from erroneous interpretations due to a more cautious coping style of shy individuals in the respective setup used to assess learning. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Animal personality; Classical conditioning; Cognitive syndrome; Poeciliidae",,"Sommer-Trembo, C.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, Goethe University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue-Straße 13, Germany; email: sommer-trembo@gmx.de",,"Springer Verlag",14359448,,,"29974274","English","Anim.

We have addressed this question by examining individual performances across multiple experiments with the same population of primates. We compiled a dataset spanning 16 social learning studies (26 experimental conditions) carried out at the same study site over a 12-year period, incorporating a total of 167 chimpanzees. We applied a binary scoring system to code each participant’s performance in each study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not (Social Information Score—‘SIS’). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age, prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females were, depending on their rearing history, 15–24% more likely to use social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However, there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience, and pedigree records indicated that SIS was not a strongly heritable trait.

It has been proposed recently that not only mean behaviour (behavioural type), but the environmentally induced behavioural change (behavioural plasticity) might also differ between individuals within populations. While case studies presenting between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity have started to accumulate, the mechanisms behind its emergence are virtually unknown. We have recently demonstrated that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli during ontogeny are necessary for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes. However, it is unknown whether between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity is hard-wired or induced. Here, we tested whether experience with predation during development affected predator-induced behavioural plasticity in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We ran a common garden experiment with two ontogenetic predation treatments: tadpoles developed from hatching in either the presence or absence of olfactory predator stimuli. Then, we assayed all tadpoles repeatedly for activity and risk-taking both in the absence and presence of olfactory predator stimuli. We found that (a) between-individual variation in predator-induced behavioural plasticity was present only in the group that developed in the presence of olfactory stimuli from predators and (b) previous experience with predatory stimuli resulted in lower plastic response at the group level. The latter pattern resulted from increased between-individual variation and not from universally lower individual responses. We also found that experience with predation during development increased the predictability (i.e. decreased the within-individual variation unrelated to environmental change) of activity, but not risk-taking. In line with this, tadpoles developing under perceived predatory risk expressed their activity with higher repeatability. We suggest that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli are not only fundamental for the development of animal personality and behavioural syndromes, but also for individual variation in behavioural plasticity. Thus, experience is of central importance for the emergence of individual behavioural variation at many levels. © 2018 The Authors.

Clonal animals are ideal models for developmental studies because personality differences can be solely attributed to environmental factors. Here, I investigated the presence of personality within a species of clonal gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, at different developmental stages. For juveniles and adult geckos, I measured exploration (reaction to a novel situation) and boldness (risk-prone tendency) and evaluated repeatability and correlation of these behavioural traits. Each gecko exhibited different exploration and boldness with significant repeatability through time but no correlation between these behavioural traits. Small juveniles were composed of only bold and low explorative individuals but large juveniles and adults were composed of various personality type individuals. These results demonstrate that subject geckos have a similar personality structure across life stages and that exploration and boldness are independent personality without forming behavioural syndrome structure. Biased composition of personality type between life stages suggests that appearance of different personality type individuals during an early ontogenetic stage generates personality variation within the clonal population.

Parental care can vary consistently between individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that, depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent, suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking parenting styles to fitness in swallow species. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","animal personality; behavioral syndrome; feeding rate; parental provisioning; repeatability; time-budget","aggression; behavioral response; conspecific; defense mechanism; feeding behavior; mate choice; nest predation; nest site; parental care; passerine; psychology; reproductive success; testosterone; trade-off; Brazil; Animalia; Aves; Hirundinidae; Tachycineta leucorrhoa","Wischhoff, U.; Pós-graduação em Ecologia, Conservação e Manejo de Vida Silvestre, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: uschiw@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050982302

However, little is known about the causes of variation in phenotypic plasticity of the stress response in wild populations. In the present study, we repeatedly captured individual roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from two wild populations in Sweden exposed to differing levels of predation pressure and measured plasma concentrations of stress-induced cortisol and behavioral docility. While controlling for the marked effects of habituation, we found clear between-population differences in the stress-induced cortisol response. Roe deer living in the area that was recently recolonized by lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolves (Canis lupus) expressed cortisol levels that were around 30% higher than roe deer in the human-dominated landscape free of large carnivores. In addition, for the first time to our knowledge, we investigated the stress-induced cortisol response in free-ranging newborn fawns and found no evidence for hypo-responsiveness during early life in this species. Indeed, stress-induced cortisol levels were of similar magnitude and differed between populations to a similar extent in both neonates and adults. Finally, at an individual level, we found that both cortisol and docility levels were strongly repeatable, and weakly negatively inter-correlated, suggesting that individuals differed consistently in how they respond to a stressor, and supporting the existence of a stress-management syndrome in roe deer. © 2018, The Author(s).","Coping style; Docility; Glucocorticoid; Neonatal period; Predation risk","biochemical composition; canid; deer; environmental change; environmental stress; gene expression; habituation; hormone; neonate; phenotypic plasticity; plasma; predation risk; psychology; steroid; wild population; Canidae; Canis lupus; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Lynx; Lynx lynx","Bonnot, N.C.; Grimsö Wildlife Research Station, Department of Ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural SciencesSweden; email: nadege.bonnot@slu.se",,"Springer Verlag",00298549,,OECOB,,"English","Oecologia",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047434098

Site fidelity, where individuals consistently use the same foraging site, is common among marine predators. Sex differences in foraging are also well studied in marine vertebrates, but the extent to which consistent inter-individual differences in foraging vary between the sexes is poorly known. Here we quantified the effects of sex on individual foraging site fidelity (IFSF), both within and between years, in chick-brooding Campbell albatross Thalassarche impavida. Using bird-borne global positioning system loggers, we calculated route fidelity (nearest-neighbour distance), repeatability of site fidelity (terminal latitude and longitude), and foraging effort (total distance travelled and trip duration) during 2 to 10 repeat trips. Overall, Campbell albatrosses showed a high degree of site fidelity. Birds travelled to similar sites not only within the same year, but also between 2 consecutive years, suggesting that the within-year consistency is not simply in response to short-term patches of food. Moreover, within the same year, we found differences in terms of IFSF between the sexes. Females that foraged closer to the colony in neritic and shelf waters were more likely to follow similar routes on repeated foraging trips and were more consistent in their foraging effort than males. Males that foraged further offshore in pelagic waters had more repeatable foraging longitudes than females. Our study provides further evidence of the importance of IFSF among marine vertebrates. However, it also reveals that the strength of such specialisations may vary with sex. © Inter-Research 2018","Foraging effort; GPS tracking; Repeatability; Route fidelity; Sex effects","aquatic organism; colony; evolutionary biology; foraging efficiency; GPS; interspecific variation; marine environment; predator; seabird; site fidelity; specialization; vertebrate; Aves; Diomedeidae; Thalassarche impavida; Vertebrata","Sztukowski, L.A.; Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre, University of PlymouthUnited Kingdom; email: sztewy@gmail.com",,"Inter-Research",01718630,,MESED,,"English","Mar.

Behavioral variation is known to influence animal invasions, yet comparatively less is known about how behavioral variation influences invasive-native species interactions. Here we examined how the mean and variance surrounding several behavioral traits in two sympatric species of praying mantis differ and how these behavioral types translate to actual prey capture success using the introduced European mantis, Mantis religiosa, and the native bordered mantis, Stagmomantis limbata. We assayed time spent in the open (risk proneness), response towards a novel prey, and voracity within a population of M. religiosa and S. limbata. We found that the native and invasive mantids displayed no differences in their average behavioral tendencies. The native exhibited significant levels of repeatability in voracity while the invasive did not. The lack of repeatability in the invasive appears to be driven by lower levels of among-individual variation in voracity. This may have evolutionary consequences for native S. limbata if it results in strong selection in native levels of mean and among-individual variation. Significant levels of among-individual differences were found in other behaviors (response to a novel prey and risk proneness) across species, suggesting less selection on invasive behavioral variation in these traits. Risk proneness and response towards a novel prey also formed a behavioral syndrome across species, yet neither behavior was correlated with voracity in either species. Our results illustrate the need to examine the ecological effects of behavioral variation of both invasive and native species to determine how that might impact invasive-native interactions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural syndrome; Behavioural type; Invasion; Personality; Praying mantis","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; individual variation; insect; intraspecific interaction; invasive species; invasiveness; native species; prey capture; accident proneness; animal experiment; Article; behavior; crab; high risk behavior; invasive species; latency to approach; latency to strike; Mantis religiosa; Mantodea; native species; nonhuman; perch; prey capture; response variable; sex difference; species invasion; Stagmomantis limbata; sympatry; time to leave circle; time to move; time to reach the perch; voracity; animal; animal behavior; California; Europe; female; introduced species; male; Mantodea; physiology; Animalia; Mantis; Mantis religiosa; Mantodea; Stagmomantis limbata; Animals; Behavior, Animal; California; Europe; Female; Introduced Species; Male; Mantodea","Jones, C.; University of California, One Shields AvenueUnited States; email: camjones@ucdavis.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"29802859","English","Behav.

Does this conflict with potential phenotypic plasticity which should be adaptive for animals facing various contexts and situations? This fundamental question has been tested predominantly in studies which were done in non-breeding contexts and under laboratory conditions. Therefore, in the present study we examined the temporal stability of behavioural correlations in a breeding context and under natural conditions. We found that in the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) females, the intensity of their nest defence formed a behavioural syndrome with two other traits: their aggression during handling (self-defence) and stress responses during handling (breath rate). This syndrome was stable across the nesting cycle: each of the three behavioural traits was highly statistically repeatable between egg and nestling stages and the traits were strongly correlated with each other during both the egg stage and the nestling stage. Despite this consistency (i.e., rank order between stages) the individual behaviours changed their absolute values significantly during the same period. This shows that stable behavioural syndromes might be based on behaviours that are themselves unstable. Thus, syndromes do not inevitably constrain phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that the observed behavioural syndrome is the product of interactions between behavioural and life history trade-offs and that crucial proximate mechanisms for the plasticity and correlations between individual behaviours are hormonally-regulated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Behavioural correlations; Breath rate; Handling aggression; Nest defence; Stress hormone","Acrocephalus arundinaceus; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; behavior assessment; breathing rate; breeding; Clarias macrocephalus; egg laying; female; nest predation; nonhuman; phenotypic plasticity; syndrome; animal; nesting; phenotype; physiology; reproduction; songbird; Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Animalia; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Nesting Behavior; Phenotype; Reproduction; Songbirds","Trnka, A.; Department of Biology, University of Trnava, Priemyselná 4, Slovakia; email: atrnka@truni.sk",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"29870797","English","Behav.

Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. ‘trap happy’ versus ‘trap shy’). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture–mark–recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used as a proxy for personality. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","behavioural syndrome; capture probability; open field; small mammal; trap happy; trap shy","behavior; data set; experiment; experimental design; field method; mark-recapture method; probability; small mammal; social behavior; trapping; Animalia; Blarina brevicauda; Clethrionomys gapperi; Mammalia; Napaeozapus; Napaeozapus insignis; Peromyscus; Peromyscus maniculatus; Tamiasciurus hudsonicus","Brehm, A.M.; Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Conservation Biology, University of Maine, 5755 Nutting Hall, United States; email: allison.brehm@maine.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for the records of temperament testing that are used to improve the temperament of Jeju crossbred (Jeju×Thoroughbred) horses. Methods: This study was conducted using 205 horses (101 females and 104 males) produced between 2010 and 2015. The experimental animals were imprinted and tamed according to the Manual for Horse Taming and Evaluation for Therapeutic Riding Horses and evaluated according to the categories for temperament testing (gentleness, patience, aggressiveness, sensitivity, and friendliness) between 15 months and 18 months of age. Each category was scored on a five-point linear scale. Genetic parameters for the test categories were analyzed using a multi-trait mixed model with repeated records. The ASReml program was used to analyze the data. Results: The heritability of gentleness, patience, aggressiveness, sensitivity and friendliness ranged from 0.08 to 0.53. The standard errors of estimated heritability ranged from 0.13 to 0.17. The test categories showed high genetic correlations with each other, ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 and high repeatability, ranging from 0.70 to 0.73. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the test categories had moderate heritability and high genetic correlations, but additional studies may be necessary to use the results for the improvement programs of the temperament of Jeju crossbred horses. © 2018 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.","Genetic Correlation; Heritability; Jeju Crossbred Horses; Repeatability; Temperament",,"Park, H.B.; Subtropical Livestock Research Institute, National Institute of Animal Science, RDASouth Korea; email: heebokp@korea.kr",,"Asian-Australasian Association of Animal Production Societies",10112367,,,,"English","Asian-Australas.

The objectives of this study were to assess the phenotypic variability in core body temperature and sweating rate and to evaluate the effect of coat type, temperament, and BW on core body temperature and sweating rate in Brangus heifers. During August and September of 2016, 725 Brangus heifers were evaluated on pasture in four separate groups (n = 200, 189, 197, and 139). Environmental measurements of dry bulb temperature (Tdb) and relative humidity (RH) were measured every 15 min during the entire time of data collection and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to quantify heat-stress potential. Coat score, sweating rate, chute score, exit score, and live weight were recorded as the animals passed through the chute. Vaginal temperature was recorded every 5 min for five consecutive days. There was significant variation in vaginal temperature between heifers in the same environmental conditions (σ2u = 0.049), suggesting opportunities for selective improvements. A repeatability of 0.47 and 0.44 was estimated for sweating rate and vaginal temperature, respectively, suggesting that one measurement would be able to adequately describe the sweating capacity or ability to control the body temperature of an individual. Vaginal temperature increased as THI increased, with approximately 1 h lag time in the animal's response. Vaginal temperature (-0.047 °C, P = 0.015) and sweating rate were lower (-5.49 ± 2.12 g/(m2·h), P < 0.01) for heifers that demonstrated a calmer behavior in the chute. Animals with shorter, smoother hair coats had significantly lower vaginal temperatures when compared to animals with longer hair coats (P < 0.01). Also, heavier heifers in this study maintained lower (P < 0.0001) vaginal temperature than the lighter heifers.

These tests, carried out in a same novel arena, have been used for different taxa, but only a few papers underline the importance of method validation. Here we investigate how Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) and Eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) behave during OFT and MIS. Next, we compare the performance between three analytical methods: the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Factor Analysis (FA) and an expert-based (EB) method. The EB approach classifies behaviours in groups relating on researchers’ knowledge and returns personality-trait values for each individual facilitating comparisons over studies and/or with new datasets. The comparison between the three methods gave similar results and high repeatabilities in some expert-based personality traits as well as PCA components and FA factors, showing that all three methods were valid to measure activity using OFT (both species) and sociability using MIS (grey squirrel). Repeatabilities of the other traits were less strong. Proportion of time spent in different behaviours did not differ with test duration, since shorter tests yielded valid measures of individual differences in personality. Shorter tests reduce operator time in the field, and are likely to reduce stress and arena-habituation of the animals. Test sequence affected the outcome of OFT: squirrels tested for the first time were more active than squirrels tested a second time. For the two squirrel species investigated, we recommend an OFT of 4 min and a MIS test of three and suggest to test an individual no more than 2 times per season with at least 2 months between repetitions. © 2018 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia",,,"Mazzamuto, M.V.email: maria.mazzamuto@uninsubria.it",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",03949370,,EEEVE,,"English","Ethol.

Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks. Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive period for behavioural development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioural variation; Cavia aperea; Developmental plasticity; Developmental stress; Glucocorticoids; Permanent environment; Phenotypic modularity; Trait covariance",,"Guenther, A.; Department of Animal Behaviour, Bielefeld UniversityGermany; email: anja.guenther@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Academic Press Inc.",0018506X,,HOBEA,,"English","Horm.

Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We found a general decline in investment in cell construction and provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r ~ 0.15), and traits were loosely organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of independent evolutionary trajectories. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Although migration to more favourable environments may offer higher growth rates, migrants often experience increased mortality due to predation. Here, we investigated mortality and migration behaviour of the North Sea houting (Coregonus oxyrinchus), an anadromous salmonid endemic to the Wadden Sea. We used acoustic telemetry to map the migration of the only remaining indigenous population by applying stationary hydrophones combined with manual tracking. Data suggested a total mortality of 26%, with 30% of the total mortality attributed to predation by great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), highlighting that North Sea houting conservation could be jeopardised by increased cormorant predation. Risk of cormorant predation was size-dependent, with smaller fish suffering higher risk of predation. The study found North Sea houting to exhibit disparate migration strategies and identified a lentic area in the estuary as an important habitat. Two newly established artificial lakes within the river system significantly reduced the migration speeds, possibly indicating constrained navigation through the lakes. The migration into the Wadden Sea correlated with temperature perhaps indicating osmoregulatory constraints of sea entry. Unlike many salmonid species, migration occurred both day and night. Moreover, fish exhibited repeatable individual differences in diel activity patterns, suggesting that individuals differ consistently in their migratory activity throughout the 24-hr period. Our study provides novel information on salmonid migration, which is crucial for the development of science-based conservation strategies. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study characterized the 1) spatial heterogeneity in salinity in the mangrove forest habitat of the self-fertilizing, amphibious mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), 2) metabolic cost and behavioral response to acute exposure to novel salinity, and 3) repeatability of individual responses to acute changes in salinity. In mangrove habitats on Long Caye, Belize, salinity varied widely over short distances from 20.9-41.7‰ over a 90 cm distance. In the lab, fish were exposed to an acute change in salinity of Δ10, 20, or 30‰. Oxygen consumption significantly decreased in response to a 10‰ decrease in salinity and increased when salinity was elevated by 30‰. Activity levels significantly increased with an increase in salinity (Δ20 and 30‰). Individuals showed repeatable differences in both oxygen consumption rates and activity levels. Together, our data show that K. marmoratus is highly responsive to abrupt increases in salinity. Thus, movements made by K. marmoratus between temporary pools in the mangrove forest will acutely alter behavior and possibly metabolism, with many potential ecological consequences. © 2018 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.",,"aquatic organism; behavioral response; environmental conditions; fish; mangrove; oxygen consumption; physiological response; pollution exposure; salinity; Belize [Central America]; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Pisces","Sutton, A.O.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of GuelphCanada; email: asutto01@uoguelph.ca",,"American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists",00458511,,COPAA,,"English","Copeia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048342407

Some of these sounds predict important events that influence fitness while others are unimportant. Individuals can learn specific sound cues and ‘soundscapes’ and use them for vital activities such as foraging, predator avoidance, communication and orientation. Most research with sounds in elasmobranchs has focused on hearing thresholds and attractiveness to sound sources, but very little is known about their abilities to learn about sounds, especially in benthic species. Here we investigated if juvenile Port Jackson sharks could learn to associate a musical stimulus with a food reward, discriminate between two distinct musical stimuli, and whether individual personality traits were linked to cognitive performance. Five out of eight sharks were successfully conditioned to associate a jazz song with a food reward delivered in a specific corner of the tank. We observed repeatable individual differences in activity and boldness in all eight sharks, but these personality traits were not linked to the learning performance assays we examined. These sharks were later trained in a discrimination task, where they had to distinguish between the same jazz and a novel classical music song, and swim to opposite corners of the tank according to the stimulus played. The sharks’ performance to the jazz stimulus declined to chance levels in the discrimination task. Interestingly, some sharks developed a strong side bias to the right, which in some cases was not the correct side for the jazz stimulus. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Associative learning; Behaviour; Cognition; Elasmobranch; Hearing; Personality",,"Vila Pouca, C.; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie UniversityAustralia; email: catarina.vilapouca@mq.edu.au",,"Springer Verlag",14359448,,,"29691698","English","Anim.

When conducting conservation translocations using captive-reared animals, elucidating mechanisms influencing habitat preference pre-release could inform rearing methods and post-release behavior. We raised 32 captive-born eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) for eight months—16 in naturalistic enriched enclosures and 16 in unenriched enclosures. We then let each turtle choose between environments simulating both rearing conditions in a novel enclosure to evaluate the hypothesis that rearing environment influences habitat selection. Preference for the enriched environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.54–0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.62–0.98) turtles. Those that chose the enriched habitat (n = 27) did so in less than half the time (x¯ = 504.8 s, 95% CI: 266.49–743.04) than those that selected the unenriched one (n = 5, x¯ = 1339.0 s, 95% CI: 783.84–1894.07, P = 0.009). Selection latency did not differ between rearing treatments (P = 0.871). We conducted a second experiment to clarify if preferences were based on familiarity or novelty by using the same enclosure, but we gave individuals a choice between the habitat representing their rearing condition and a novel object (empty tissue box). Preference for respective rearing environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.59–0.98) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.54–0.96) individuals. Selection latency did not differ based on side chosen (P = 0.439) or rearing treatment (P = 0.764). Selection latency was repeatable by individuals (R = 0.47, 90% CI = 0.24–0.71, P = 0.003), and this personality trait may be heritable since it was also repeatable by clutch mates (R = 0.36, 90% CI = 0.03–0.62, P = 0.001). Preference for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior experience. Housing this species in enriched enclosures should increase welfare. Moreover, our collective findings highlight the importance of evaluating how intrinsic effects could affect translocation outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Animal personality; Choice experiment; Environmental enrichment; Head-starting; Terrapene carolina; Wildlife translocation","captive population; environmental effect; experimental design; habitat selection; habitat type; preference behavior; translocation; turtle; wild population; Animalia; Terrapene; Terrapene carolina; Testudines","Tetzlaff, S.J.; Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1102 South Goodwin Avenue, United States; email: tetzsj01@illinois.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

This can be key in important social dynamics such as leadership, which is often positively related to personality traits such as boldness. Individuals consistently differ in how social they are (their sociability), so if other axes of personality variation, such as boldness, can be suppressed during social interactions, this suppression should be stronger in more sociable individuals. We measured boldness (latency to leave a refuge when alone) and sociability (time spent with a conspecific) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gas-terosteus aculeatus) and tested the boldness–leadership association in pairs of these fish. Both boldness and sociability were repeatable, but were not correlated. When splitting the data between the 50% most sociable and 50% less sociable fish, boldness was more strongly associated with leadership in less rather than more sociable individuals. This is consistent with more sociable fish conforming to their partner’s behaviour due to their greater social tendency. One axis of personality variation (sociability) can thus modulate the relationship between others (boldness and leadership), with potential implications for selection on personality variation in social animals. © 2018 The Authors.","Boldness; Conformity; Decision-making; Leadership; Personality; Sociability","conspecific; decision making; individual variation; leadership; refuge; social behavior; social characteristics; teleost; Animalia; Gasterosteus aculeatus","Ioannou, C.C.; School of Biological Sciences, University of BristolUnited Kingdom; email: c.c.ioannou@bristol.ac.uk",,"Royal Society Publishing",09628452,,PRLBA,,"English","Proc.

The sea lamprey is invasive in the Upper Laurentian Great Lakes and the target of a binational control program. Trapping could be used for control if trapping efficiency is unbiased and effective. Our test involved comparing the behaviour of sea lamprey collected in the field from a trap (n = 42) at a barrier and electrofished (n = 9) downstream of the barrier. We quantified each individual's latency to exit an enclosure (a measure of exploration), proportion of time spent moving (a measure of general activity), and change in activity in response to a putative predator cue (a measure of boldness). CIDs were detected for each behaviour measured (intraclass correlations: 0.3–0.5). CIDs in behaviour also differed between trapped individuals and those collected downstream using electrofishing, irrespective of size, sex, and maturity status. Trapped individuals decreased their activity in response to a putative predator cue, while individuals collected using electrofishing increased their activity in response to the cue. Trapped individuals also tended to spend a greater proportion of time moving than individuals sampled downstream of the trap. However, the two samples of lamprey did not differ significantly in time taken to exit an enclosure. The behavioural differences between sea lamprey sampled from a trap and those sampled downstream of the trap suggest that CIDs in behaviour can influence an individual's vulnerability to trapping. © 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.","Boldness; Exploration; Invasive species; Personality; Sea lamprey; Trapping","Enclosures; Natural resources exploration; Boldness; Invasive species; Personality; Sea lampreys; Trapping; Lakes; Petromyzon marinus; Petromyzontidae","McLean, A.R.; Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Canada; email: mcleaa7@mcmaster.ca",,"International Association of Great Lakes Research",03801330,,JGLRD,,"English","J.

One possibility is that among-individual behavioural variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between ‘high-risk exploration’ and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations between feeding duration and two ‘risky’ behaviours, such that individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a ‘proactive syndrome’ in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources, while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality variation observed in wild populations. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","among-individual variation; boldness; Palaemon elegans; personality; resource-holding potential; risk","Animalia; Dares; Palaemon elegans","Maskrey, D.K.; Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences, School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool, Nicholson Building, United Kingdom; email: D.Maskrey@liverpool.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems. © 2018 Chen et al.

Empirical data have revealed an ever-increasing number and diversity of taxa that display these phenotypic patterns in both wild and captive settings. Moreover, these behavioral traits are frequently linked to wild behavior, life history strategies, and measures of individual fitness. Understanding personality is of particular importance for some animals, such as large carnivores, which may express maladaptive behavior that can lead to conflict with humans. To date, few studies of personality exist on large carnivores and none have investigated the presence of personality in black bears (Ursus americanus). Through focal animal sampling, and open field, novel object, and startle object tests, we investigate the potential for personality in captive black bear cubs. Results indicate the presence of personality, with consistency in behavior across five metrics for the bold-shy axis, and eight sampling events measuring responses for the activity axis.

Within-population variation in circulating glucocorticoids has been linked with both reproductive success and survival, but the presence and direction of relationships vary. Although conceptual models suggest the potential for interactions between glucocorticoid secretion under acute stress and non-acute stress contexts to influence phenotype and fitness, very little is known about the presence or implications of such interactions. Here we use a large data set from breeding tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor; n = 215 adults) to test the predictors of reproductive success and annual survival probability in females and males over a four-year period. Across years and life history stages, glucocorticoids predicted fitness in female tree swallows. Under challenging conditions, females that maintained low baseline corticosterone levels during incubation had higher reproductive success. During the nestling provisioning period, interactions between baseline glucocorticoids and the stress response suggest that females may face trade-offs in the regulation of glucocorticoids across contexts. Reproductive success was highest among females that maintained low baseline glucocorticoids coupled with a strong acute stress response, and among females with high baseline glucocorticoids and a weak acute stress response. Females with low or high glucocorticoid levels across contexts (baseline and acute stress) fledged fewer young. Glucocorticoid levels did not predict fledging success in males. None of the models of annual survival probability in females received strong support; model comparisons suggested weak negative effects of stress responsiveness during nestling provisioning, and positive effects of body condition and age, on survival. Male survival probability was not predicted by breeding phenotype. Within and across years the glucocorticoid stress response was individually repeatable; across-year repeatability was particularly high during the nestling provisioning period. Both measures of the acute stress response-circulating stress-induced corticosterone levels and their stress-induced increase-showed similar repeatability, but baseline corticosterone was not repeatable within or across years.

While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase. Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g. eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5–23% of the variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of individual identity explained 46–65% of the variation. This variation drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits, suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and vice versa. © 2018 The Author(s)","animal architecture; animal personality; extended phenotype; offspring defence; parental investment","Animalia; Aves; Crustacea; Latrodectus hasselti","DiRienzo, N.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, P.O.

In reptiles, incubation temperature is a critical aspect of the early developmental environment. Incubation temperature influences morphology, physiology, and behavior of non-avian reptiles, however, little is known about how incubation temperature influences offspring phenotype and behaviors important to avian survival. To investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors, we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8, and 37.0°C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further, duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative of a proactive–reactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However, neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior. This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained within populations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aix sponsa; behavioral syndrome; coping style; corticosterone; early developmental environment; parental effect; wood duck",,"Hope, S.F.; Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, Virginia TechUnited States; email: shope@vt.edu",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",24715638,,,"29806120","English","J.

Breath rate and its change during and after handling [handling stress (HS) test] has been used to test individual response to stress. In previous laboratory research, the HS test has revealed a continuous decrease from peak values immediately after catching, which was consistent in adults of precocial and altricial species. Because of opposite trends in nestlings versus adults in altricial birds, we ask what breath rate pattern appears in precocial chicks in natural conditions? Advanced development during their early ontogeny compared to altricials could lead to breath rates similar to adults, but the effect of age, (in)experience, as well as environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature, may significantly shape breath rate patterns in chicks in different ways than in adults. In this study, we examined patterns in breath rate in response to HS in chicks of different age in a precocial wader, the Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) in the wild. Factors responsible for variation were simultaneously identified. We show that breath rate significantly dropped after visual isolation in a textile bag, a pattern similar to that in adult birds, and increased with the age of chicks as well as with higher ambient temperature. Breath rate was individually repeatable, but did not reflect individual behaviour observed before capture. Our results suggest that, when controlled for ambient temperature and time before catching, the breath rate pattern has the potential to be used as a useful HS test for neonatal Northern Lapwing chicks in the field. © 2017, Dt.

Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is, activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles’ sex or age. Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits, the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals might affect the further development and survival of populations and thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the ecosystem. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","activity; behavioural phenotype; boldness; exploration; habitat loss; inbreeding depression; inbreeding-environment interactions; Phaedon cochleariae; reproductive output; wild population","activity pattern; anthropogenic effect; beetle; fitness; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; inbreeding; inbreeding depression; life history trait; ontogeny; phenotype; population size; survival; trophic level; wild population; Arthropoda; Coleoptera; Phaedon cochleariae","Müller, T.; Department of Chemical Ecology, Bielefeld University, Universitätsstr. 25, Germany; email: thorben.mueller@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

The social environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness, activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation. Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social environment had the greater effect.

How these differences are maintained in response to changes in population density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates. Using a behavioral reaction norm (BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk (Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this May suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits (e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity. Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in other ecological processes (e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice, disease transfer). © 2018 O’Brien et al.

However, links between an individual's positions on behavioral vs. ecological axes of variation remain relatively unstudied in the wild. In the course of fieldwork on a remote floodplain in tropical Australia, we quantified boldness and ecological traits in 86 free-ranging (radio-tracked) monitor lizards (Varanus panoptes). These large (up to 7 kg) lizards exhibited a spectrum of boldness, as reflected in correlated scores of responses to approach, handling, and novel prey. Bolder lizards had larger core home ranges and higher mating success and spent more time in areas of high predator abundance, and their seasonal regimes of predation-induced mortality differed from those of shyer lizards. Thus, behavioral differences among lizards underpin much of the variation in ecological traits and individual fitness within this population.

A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in ‘personality’ evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the integration of ‘intrinsic state’ and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones, energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate.

Previous research has highlighted how universal interaction rules shape collective behaviour, and that individual differences can drive group functioning. Groups themselves may also differ considerably in their collective behaviour, but little is known about the consistency of such group variation, especially across different ecological contexts that may alter individuals’ behavioural responses. Here, we test if randomly composed groups of sticklebacks differ consistently from one another in both their structure and movement dynamics across an open environment, an environment with food, and an environment with food and shelter. Based on high-resolution tracking data of the free-swimming shoals, we found large context-associated changes in the average behaviour of the groups. But despite these changes and limited social familiarity among group members, substantial and predictable behavioural differences between the groups persisted both within and across the different contexts (group-level repeatability): some groups moved consistently faster, more cohesively, showed stronger alignment and/or clearer leadership than other groups. These results suggest that among-group heterogeneity could be a widespread feature in animal societies. Future work that considers grouplevel variation in collective behaviour may help understand the selective pressures that shape how animal collectives form and function. © 2018 The Authors.","Collective behaviour; Group differences; Group personality; Schooling; Sociality; Stickleback","behavioral response; familiarity; functional group; group behavior; heterogeneity; movement; schooling behavior; teleost; tracking; Animalia","Jolles, J.W.; Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, United Kingdom; email: j.w.jolles@gmail.com",,"Royal Society Publishing",09628452,,PRLBA,,"English","Proc.

Social organisms are especially serviceable to animal personality techniques because they can be used to explore behavioral variation at both the individual and group level. Despite the success of personality research in social organisms generally, and social Hymenoptera in particular, social wasps (Vespidae) have received little to no attention in the personality literature. In the present study, we test Polistes metricus (Vespidae; Polistinae) paper wasp queens for the presence of repeatable variation in, and correlations (""behavioral syndromes"") between, several commonly used personality metrics: boldness, aggressiveness, exploration, and activity. Our results indicate that P. metricus queens exhibit personalities for all measured traits and correlations between different behavioral measures. Given that paper wasps have served as a model organism for a wide range of phenomena such as kin selection, dominance hierarchies, mate choice, facial recognition, social parasitism, and chemical recognition, we hope that our results will motivate researchers to explore whether, or to what degree, queen personality is important in their research programs. © The Author (2017).

In particular, changes in water availability during development may initiate a range of behavioral responses, such as natal dispersal, but the contribution of maternal effects from water stress in explaining behavioral variation has been overlooked so far. In this study, we examined behavioral plasticity of juvenile common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) in response to changes in pre-natal and post-natal hydric conditions. We exposed pregnant mothers either to a moderate water restriction or to ad libitum access to water. We used neutral arena tests to measure repeatedly activity and space use behaviors of their offspring, either in dry or wet soil conditions, at two distinct life stages (juveniles and yearlings) in order to quantify behavioral flexibility, age differences, and personalities (consistent inter-individual differences). Juveniles and yearlings had greater exploration scores in dry than wet conditions regardless of the pre-natal conditions. Pre-natal water restriction and dry post-natal conditions enhanced thigmotaxis (i.e., a behavior related to anxiety) in juveniles. Maternal environment did not influence behavioral flexibility nor the behavior of yearlings. Behaviors were barely repeatable in juveniles and inconsistent through early life. Assuming that dry conditions may initiate flight responses, these results suggest complex relationships between the developmental timing of water stress, exploration and anxiety behaviors, and dispersal syndromes. Significance statement: Water restriction should initiate a range of behaviors related to a flight response. However, there is little evidence that changes in water availability across development influence offspring behavior in wild animals. Experiments with lizards demonstrate that maternal water restriction increased the anxiety of their juveniles, whereas their exploration was higher in dry environments. Thus, water availability may be a critical determinant of space use behavior and dispersal syndromes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Exploration; Maternal effects; Reptiles; Stress; Thigmotaxis; Water availability","activity pattern; age; behavioral response; dispersal; flight; heritability; individual variation; juvenile; lizard; maternal effect; movement; space use; viviparity; water availability; water stress; Animalia; Reptilia; Squamata; Zootoca vivipara","Rozen-Rechels, D.; Sorbonne Université, CNRS, IRD, INRA, Institut d’Ecologie et des Sciences de l’Environnement de Paris, iEES-Paris, 75252, France; email: david.rozen_rechels@upmc.fr",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

However, few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk avoidance behaviour covary with life-history traits among individuals in natural populations, or how these links vary depending on the context and the way risk aversion is measured. We measured two different risk avoidance behaviours (latency to enter the nest and inspection time) in wild great tits (Parus major) in two different contexts— response to a novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during incubation—and related these behaviours to female reproductive success and condition. Females responded equally strongly to both stimuli, and although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate. Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number of offspring fledged. By contrast, inspection time was directly explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between risk aversion and fitness depend on how risk aversion was measured. Our results highlight the limitations of drawing conclusions about the relevance of single measures of a personality trait such as risk aversion. © 2018 The Authors.","Body condition; Gaze aversion; Great tits; Life history; Personality; Risk-taking",,"Davidson, G.L.; Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University College CorkIreland; email: gabrielle.davidson@ucc.ie",,"Royal Society Publishing",20545703,,,,"English","R.

Verbal models of individual stress “coping style” have proposed that the behavioural component of this variation can be described as a single axis, with each individual's coping style being consistent across time and stress contexts. Focusing on this behavioural component of stress response and combining repeated measures of multiple traits with a novel multivariate modelling framework, we test for the existence of coping style variation and assess its stability across contexts in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we test the following hypotheses: (1) there exists repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation (“personality”) within a mild stress context consistent with a risk-averse–risk-prone continuum of behavioural coping style, (2) there is population-level plasticity in behaviour as a function of stressor severity, (3) there is among-individual variation in plasticity (i.e. IxE), and (4) the presence of IxE reduces cross-context stability of behavioural coping style. We found significant repeatable among-individual behavioural (co)variation in the mild stress context (open field trial), represented as an I matrix. However, I was not readily described by a simple risk-averse–risk-prone continuum as posited by the original coping style model. We also found strong evidence for population-level changes in mean behaviour with increasing stressor severity (simulated avian and piscine predation risks). Single-trait analyses did show the presence of individual-by-environment interactions (IxE), as among-individual cross-context correlations were significantly less than +1. However, multitrait analysis revealed the consequences of this plasticity variation were minimal. Specifically, we found little evidence for changes in the structure of I between mild and moderate stress contexts overall, and only minor changes between the two moderate contexts (avian vs. piscine predator). We show that a multivariate approach to assessing changes in among-individual (co)variance across contexts can prevent the over-interpretation of statistically significant, but small, individual-by-environment effects. While behavioural flexibility enables populations (and individuals) to respond rapidly to changes in the environment, multivariate personality structure can be conserved strongly across such contexts.

This inequality in parental contribution is reduced when offspring survival is dependent on biparental care. However, this idea has received little empirical attention. Here, we determined whether mothers and fathers differed in their contribution to care in a captive population of coyotes (Canis latrans). We performed parental care assays on 8 (n = 8 males, 8 females) mated pairs repeatedly over a 10-week period (i.e., 5-15 weeks of litter age) when pairs were first-time breeders (2011), and again as experienced breeders (2013). We quantified consistent individual variation (i.e., repeatability) in 8 care behaviors and examined within-and among-individual correlations to determine if behavioral plasticity within or parental personality across seasons varied by sex. Finally, we extracted hormone metabolites (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) from fecal samples collected during gestation to describe potential links between hormonal mechanisms and individual consistency in parental behaviors. Parents differed in which behaviors were repeatable: mothers demonstrated consistency in provisioning and pup-directed aggression, whereas fathers were consistent in pup checks. However, positive within-individual correlations for identical behaviors (e.g., maternal versus paternal play) suggested that the rate of change in all behaviors except provisioning was highly correlated between the sexes. Moreover, positive among-individual correlations among 50% of identical behaviors suggested that personality differences across parents were highly correlated. Lastly, negative among-individual correlations among pup-directed aggression, provisioning, and gestational testosterone in both sexes demonstrated potential links between preparental hormones and labile parental traits. We provide novel evidence that paternal contribution in a biparental species reaches near equivalent rates of their partners. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.","biparental care; Canis latrans; cortisol; coyote; negotiation model; repeatability; sexual conflict; testosterone","behavioral response; canid; captive population; correlation; individual variation; metabolite; parent-offspring interaction; parental care; parental investment; pregnancy; reproductive cost; sexual conflict; steroid; survival; Canidae; Canis latrans","Schell, C.J.; Committee on Evolutionary Biology, University of ChicagoUnited States; email: cjschell@uw.edu",,"Allen Press Inc.",00222372,,JOMAA,,"English","J.

Metabolically active primary tumour volumes were defined in [18F]FDG images and transferred to co-registered [18F]EF5 images for repeatability analysis. A tumour-to-muscle uptake ratio (TMR) of 1.5 at 3 h from injection of [18F]EF5 was used as a threshold representing hypoxic tissue. Results: In 10 paired [18F]EF5 PET/CT image sets, SUVmean, SUVmax, and TMR showed a good correlation with the intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.81, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively. The relative coefficients of repeatability for these parameters were 15%, 17%, and 10%, respectively. Fractional hypoxic volumes of the tumours in the repeated scans had a high correlation using the Spearman rank correlation test (r = 0.94). In a voxel-by-voxel TMR analysis between the repeated scans, the mean of Pearson correlation coefficients of individual patients was 0.65. The mean (± SD) difference of TMR in the pooled data set was 0.03 ± 0.20. Conclusion: Pretreatment [18F]EF5 PET/CT within one week shows high repeatability and is feasible for the guiding of hypoxia-targeted treatment interventions in HNC. © 2017, The Author(s).","18F-EF5; Head and neck cancer; Hypoxia; Pet; Repeatability","2 (2 nitro 1h imidazol 1 yl) n (2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl)acetamide f 18; antineoplastic agent; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; unclassified drug; 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide; etanidazole; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorine; Fluorine-18; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical trial; computer assisted emission tomography; correlation coefficient; head and neck cancer; human; measurement repeatability; middle aged; primary tumor; prospective study; tumor hypoxia; analogs and derivatives; cancer staging; diagnostic imaging; female; head and neck tumor; male; pathology; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; Aged; Etanidazole; Female; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prospective Studies; Tumor Hypoxia","Silvoniemi, A.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery, Turku University Hospital, P.O.

Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which describes variation within an individual through time, and personality, which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored. Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms generating individual variation. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","Amphiprion percula; individual variation; parental care; personality; plasticity; reaction norm; resource availability","Amphiprion percula","Barbasch, T.A.; Department of Biology and Marine Program, Boston University, 5 Cummington Mall, United States; email: tbarbasc@bu.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Our objective was to quantify the among-individual correlation (rind) and within-individual correlation (re) between locomotor performance and personality traits in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We repeatedly measured sprint speed, docility, and exploration behaviour and found that all traits were significantly repeatable. Sprint speed was not correlated with docility and time spent in the centre of the open field. However, sprint speed was significantly and negatively correlated with distance moved in the open field at both the among-individual (rind = − 0.59) and the within-individual (re = − 0.54) levels. Thus, individuals with high locomotor performance are less explorative in a novel environment, which is somewhat counter-intuitive and opposite to the predictions generated by the pace-of-life syndrome and the “phenotypic compensation” hypotheses. Our results suggest that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are co-specialised traits as they can reinforce each other’s effects in reducing predation risk. In refuging species such as chipmunks (i.e. individuals have to leave a refuge to forage), low exploration levels may reduce exposure to predators and high sprint speed may further reduce the probability of capture given an encounter with a predator. Thus, looking at how locomotor performance and behaviour interact and contribute to fitness is key to understanding the multivariate architecture of—and co-adaptations among—ecologically relevant complex phenotypes. Significance statement: A large number of studies have looked at the relationships between locomotor performance and behaviour at the inter-specific, among-individual, and within-individual levels, with mixed results. We found a significant and negative relationship between sprint speed and distance moved during an open-field test, which goes against the prediction of the pace-of-life syndrome and the “phenotypic compensation” hypotheses. Instead, these results support the “trait co-specialisation” hypothesis. In refuging animals such as chipmunks, reactive behaviours (being shy and less exploratory) may reduce exposure to predators and high sprint speed may further the probability of escaping given an encounter with a predator. Taken all together, the negative among- and within-individual correlations and sensitivity to the same covariates (parasites, and to a less extent body mass) suggest that sprint speed and exploratory behaviour are co-adapted in eastern chipmunks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mixed model; Personality; Repeatability; Sprint speed; Tamias striatus","adaptation; behavioral ecology; ecological modeling; exploration; fitness; locomotion; performance assessment; predation risk; refugium; rodent; survival; wild population; Animalia; Tamias striatus","Careau, V.; Canada Research Chair in Functional EcologyCanada; email: vcareau@uottawa.ca",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

There were consistent behavioural differences, or personality, between individuals across time, for dispersal, aggression, and exploration, unrelated to size or sex. The significant repeatabilities (0.10-0.46) indicate that these traits are potentially heritable.

If the proximate factors underlying individual differences in behavioral plasticity were the same for any measure of plasticity, as commonly assumed, one would expect plasticity to be repeatable across behaviors and contexts. However, this assumption remains largely untested. Here, we conducted an experiment with sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) whose behavioral plasticity was estimated both as the change in their personality traits or mating behavior across a social gradient and using their performance on a reversal-learning task. We found that the correlations between pairwise measures of plasticity were weak and non-significant, thus indicating that the most plastic individuals were not the same in all the tests. This finding might arise because either individuals adjust the magnitude of their behavioral responses depending on the benefits of plasticity, and/or individuals expressing high behavioral plasticity in one context are limited by neural and/or physiological constraints in the amount of plasticity they can express in other contexts. Because the repeatability of behavioral plasticity may have important evolutionary consequences, additional studies are needed to assess the importance of trade-offs between conflicting selection pressures on the maintenance of intra-individual variation in behavioral plasticity. © 2018 Gibelli et al.","Behavioral plasticity; General plasticity; Individual differences; Sailfin mollies","adult; article; female; human; human experiment; male; mating; nervous system; nonhuman; personality; plasticity; Poecilia latipinna; reversal learning","Gibelli, J.; Département de Sciences Biologiques, Université de MontréalCanada; email: julie.gibelli@umontreal.ca",,"PeerJ Inc.",21678359,,,,"English","PeerJ",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054930968

Despite the recent surge of studies, especially in social insects, the way individual differences translate into group performance remains debated. One hypothesis is that groups may simply differ in the average personality of their members and this would translate into inter-group differences in collective behaviour. We tested the hypothesis of a linear relationship between individual and group phenotype in the ant Formica fusca by using same-age groups of workers after measuring an individual behavioural trait. Individual exploratory activity in an open-field arena was significantly repeatable. Based on this trait, groups were composed, each consisting of 6 individuals with similar exploration tendency housed with 3 cocoons and a refuge. Individual exploratory activity was associated with the performance in cocoon recovery at the group level: groups composed of high exploratory individuals started transporting displaced cocoons significantly earlier and transported more cocoons into the refuge than groups with low exploratory workers. When in a group, more exploratory animals showed significantly more returns to the refuge than less exploratory ones and tended to transport more cocoons.

A scale evaluating common behaviours as actionable examples of WLI was introduced to measure work-life balance. Objectives: (1) Explore differences in WLI behaviours by role, specialty and other respondent demographics in a large healthcare system. (2) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the work-life climate scale, and the extent to which it acts like a climate, or group-level norm when used at the work setting level. (3) Explore associations between work-life climate and other healthcare climates including teamwork, safety and burnout. Methods: Cross-sectional survey study completed in 2016 of US healthcare workers within a large academic healthcare system. Results: 10 627 of 13 040 eligible healthcare workers across 440 work settings within seven entities of a large healthcare system (81% response rate) completed the routine safety culture survey. The overall work-life climate scale internal consistency was α=0.830. WLI varied significantly among healthcare worker role, length of time in specialty and work setting. Random effects analyses of variance for the work-life climate scale revealed significant between-work setting and within-work setting variance and intraclass correlations reflected clustering at the work setting level. T-tests of top versus bottom WLI quartile work settings revealed that positive work-life climate was associated with better teamwork and safety climates, as well as lower personal burnout and burnout climate (p<0.001). Conclusion: Problems with WLI are common in healthcare workers and differ significantly based on position and time in specialty. Although typically thought of as an individual difference variable, WLI appears to operate as a climate, and is consistently associated with better safety culture norms. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

We tested whether the common practice of adding physical structure (i.e. boulders) to streams to increase salmonid density has behavioural consequences, as open habitats are predicted to favour individuals that are more bold and aggressive. Wild young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon were captured from habitats of varying physical complexity and placed into seminatural stream enclosures for 11 days while their behaviour was observed and tested in both open and structurally complex environments. We found evidence for personality, or consistent individual behavioural differences across contexts, for avoidance and site attachment, with repeatabilities of 0.287 and 0.206, respectively, but not for activity or frequency of aggression. Fish were significantly more active and aggressive in the open habitats, and more site-attached in the complex habitats. Active and aggressive fish also grew more in the wild, while site-attached fish grew less in the wild, but more in the enclosures. However, contrary to our expectation, the complexity of the original habitat was not a significant predictor of personality. Our results suggest stream restorations involving increasing habitat complexity will alter the behaviour of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon, but will not favour any particular personality types. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","Atlantic salmon; boulders; habitat complexity; personality; stream restoration","aggression; behavioral response; complexity; environmental conditions; juvenile; psychology; salmonid; stocking density; Salmo salar; Salmonidae","Church, K.D.W.; Department of Biology, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street W, Canada; email: kathleen.church@mail.mcgill.ca",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Current methods calculate repeatability of individual points (initial and/or peak), time to peak value, or a single measure of the integrated total response (area under the curve), rather than the shape of the response profile. Repeatability estimates of response profiles using linear mixed models (LMM) generate an average repeatability for an aggregate of individuals, rather than an estimate of individual repeatability. Here we use a novel ad hoc method to calculate repeatability of individual response profiles and demonstrate the need for a more rigorous assessment protocol. Response profile repeatability has not been defined at the individual level. We do this using a new metric, Profile Repeatability (PR), which incorporates components of variance and the degree to which response profiles cross each other in a time series. Values range from 0 (no repeatability) to 1 (complete repeatability). We created synthetic data to represent a range of apparent time series repeatability, and 20 independent observers visually ranked those data sets by degree of repeatability. We also applied the method to real data on stress responses of European starlings Sturnus vulgaris. We then computed PR scores for the synthetic data and for real data from European starling corticosterone responses over time, and contrast the results to those from LMM. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of PR to reductions in the number of time points in the corticosterone response, as well as reductions in the number of replicates per individual. We found the average PR scores for a group of individuals to be somewhat robust to reductions in points in the time series; however, the ranks of individuals (PR values relative to one another) could change substantially with reduction in the number of values in a time series. PR showed threshold sensitivity to losing replicate time series between 6 and 4 replicates. Surprisingly, human observers fell into two disparate groups when ranking repeatability of the synthetic data, and the PR score indicated that human observers may underestimate repeatability of data where replicates cross each other. In contrast to the average profile repeatability estimated using LMMs, our approach calculates individual repeatability. From our perspective, LMM does not provide a definitive idea of repeatability at the individual level; in essence, it concludes that suites of time series with low within-individual variance has high repeatability, regardless of replicate trajectories. LMM and PR have non-linear relationships between 0 and 1, but PR has greater discrimination for mid-values of repeatability. Consistent average group repeatability can be associated with substantial differences in individual ranks suggests that estimating individual repeatability is critical. The PR score should be useful in comparing repeatability of any type of nonlinear, including non-monotonic, response profiles over time, which are common in both physiology and behavior, and it demonstrates the specific needs for future improvements of a profile repeatability metric. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioral phenotype; Boldness; Personality; Reaction norm; Response pattern; Stress response",,"Reed, J.M.; Department of Biology, Tufts UniversityUnited States; email: michael.reed@tufts.edu",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,,"English","Gen.

Our laboratory recently developed a paradigm to measure the reinforcing value of food versus an alternative behavior (i.e., playing with bubbles) in infants using a computerized laboratory task, during which infants press a button to earn reinforcers following a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the short-term (within 2 weeks) repeatability of this measure, specifically the outcome of infant food reinforcing ratio (FRR), or how hard infants will work for food relative to the alternative. The secondary aim was to examine whether infant age and temperament dimensions related to novelty responsiveness (high intensity pleasure and approach) moderated the repeatability of FRR. Thirty-seven infants aged 9–18 months completed this study. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no differences between time 1 and time 2 in responding for food (F = 0.463, p = 0.501), bubbles (F = 1.793, p = 0.189), or overall FRR (F = 0.797, p = 0.378). Regression models showed the association between BUB Pmax at time 1 and time 2 were moderated by infant age (p = 0.04), with greater repeatability in older infants. Linear regression models also demonstrated that the infant temperamental dimension of high intensity pleasure significantly predicted BUB Pmax at time 1 (β = 2.89, p = 0.01), but not at time 2. Overall, our findings support the repeatability of this measure for food portion of the reinforcement task, but demonstrated that the measure of non-food portion of the task required modification, in particular among children younger than 13 months old. © 2017","Food reinforcing ratio; Infant; Novelty; Obesity; Repeatability; Temperament","age; Article; baby food; body weight; child; child development; experience; female; human; human experiment; infant; male; obesity; pleasure; portion size; reinforcement; temperament; analysis; baby food; body mass; child behavior; child development; diet; eating; food preference; psychology; retrospective study; Body Mass Index; Child Development; Diet; Eating; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Infant; Infant Behavior; Infant Food; Male; Reinforcement (Psychology); Retrospective Studies; Temperament","Kong, K.L.; Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York at BuffaloUnited States; email: kkong4@buffalo.edu",,"Academic Press",01956663,,APPTD,"28807618","English","Appetite",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028708741

In this paper, we used a hierarchical framework to examine relationships between phenotypic traits thought to constrain variation in per capita resource consumption rate. Physiological and behavioural traits were assumed to be important in mediating the control of morphology and sex on consumption. We conducted a longitudinal study aiming to relate the consumption rate of submerged leaf litter to sex, morphological, physiological and behavioural traits in an aquatic detritivore population. Then, we analysed the pattern of trait covariation using structural equation modelling (SEM). We observed broad and repeatable inter-individual variation in leaf consumption rate and other phenotypic traits. We found that expressing litter consumption rate relative to the time individuals spent feeding revealed and increased the effect of body mass and sex differences, respectively. Accordingly, SEM analyses showed that time allocated to resource acquisition mediated body mass and sex effects on apparent litter consumption rate whose variation was also accounted for by an indicator of activity-specific metabolic rate. Substantial variation in resource consumption rate was due to sex difference whereas body mass was of secondary importance. Individual phenotypic trait variations strongly altered consumer-resource relationships. Therefore, we encourage studies on consumers' intraspecific variability to advance knowledge about phenotypic determinants of individual resource consumption, an important link between individuals and ecosystems. © 2018 Nordic Society Oikos.","Behavioural type; Consumer-resource interaction; Energetic balance; Gammarids; Intraspecific variation; Leaf litter; Morphology; Structural equation modelling (SEM)",,"Rota, T.email: thibaut.rota@univ-tlse3.fr",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00301299,,OIKSA,,"English","Oikos",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050487770

Thus, the ability to easily identify these differences prior to translocation may assist in improving conservation outcomes. We asked whether burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur), a marsupial species that has undergone significant decline since the introduction of exotic predators to Australia, responded in consistently different ways to capture in traps, and if so, whether this was related to anti-predator behaviour, ranging behaviour and survival following translocation. Behavioural responses of 40 bettongs were measured and included response to removal from traps (trap docility), latency to leave a trap or bag and escape behaviour upon release. We used flight initiation distance to measure escape behaviour, and distance moved from diurnal refuges during nocturnal foraging to measure ranging behaviour. Survival was measured through radiotracking after release. Behaviours scored during removal from a trap were consistent and repeatable, and formed a behavioural syndrome with anti-predator and ranging behaviour. Less docile bettongs foraged closer to refuges and had longer flight initiation distances. Less docile bettongs were also more likely to survive after release, although the sample size of mortalities was small. Our results suggest that behaviours scored during trapping could be a useful metric for pre-release screening in translocation programs to enhance the chances of individual survival post-release. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Anti-predator behaviour; Burrowing bettong; Personality; Pre-release screening; Reintroduction; Translocation",,"West, R.S.; Centre for Ecosystem Science, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: rebecca.west@unsw.edu.au",,"Springer Netherlands",09603115,,BONSE,,"English","Biodiversity Conserv.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055708166

Knowledge of whether personality is heritable, and to what degree it is influenced by the social environment, is crucial to understanding its evolutionary significance, yet few estimates are available from natural populations. We tracked three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in adult boldness. We did not detect maternal effects on any traits, but we did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness, exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a behavioural syndrome, suggesting that selection could act independently on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that social context influences personality traits. Future efforts could separate whether personality traits differ in heritability because they have served specific functional roles in the evolution of the phenotype or because our concept of personality and the stability of behaviour needs to be revised. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

How does environmentally contingent and coordinated expression of behaviors evolve? While the fitness consequences of behavioral coexpression are often hypothesized to be the driving force behind the evolution of behavioral strategies, this assumes the components that comprise a strategy are ontogenetically independent. Here, we argue that because the components’ coexpression at a preceding developmental stage can delineate the range of subsequent behavioral associations, correlations among behaviors can arise through developmental linkages of behavioral components independently of their eventual fitness consequences. To distinguish this explanation from the conventional explanation of behavioral correlations arising through stabilizing selection, we need to know the mechanistic bases of behavioral associations. We propose that the basic components of behavioral strategies can arise from neural trade-offs early in development. We review evidence for this idea from recent work on the neuroanatomical basis of personality variation in humans and other animals and from studies of design principles of neural network formation. We show that some behavioral associations arise not because selection favors the association per se, but because energetic and space constraints of the brain channel developmental variation into repeatable pathways that produce predictable behavioral variation across taxa.

The concomitant food stress is expected to detrimentally affect performance, amongst others in dispersal-related traits. Thus, while dispersal is of utmost importance to escape from deteriorating habitat conditions, such conditions may negatively feedback on the ability to do so. Therefore, we here investigate the impact of larval and adult food stress on traits related to dispersal ability, including morphology, physiology, flight performance, and exploratory behavior, in a butterfly. We show that inadequate nutrition during development and in the adult stage diminishes flight performance, despite some re-allocation of somatic resources. Detrimental effects of food stress on flight performance were mainly caused by reductions in body mass and storage reserves. Similar results were found for exploratory behavior. Furthermore, exploratory behavior was found to be (moderately) repeatable at the individual level, which might indicate the existence of a personality trait. This notion is further supported by the fact that flight performance and exploratory behavior were positively correlated, potentially suggesting the existence of a dispersal syndrome. In summary, our findings may have important implications for dispersal in natural environments, as the conditions requiring dispersal the most impair flight ability and thereby likely dispersal rates. © 2018 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Condition; Dispersal syndrome; Flight ability; Food stress; Habitat degradation; Resource allocation",,"Reim, E.email: elisabeth.reim@uni-greifswald.de",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",16729609,,,,"English","Insect Sci.",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047666758

A “twin-like” experimental design (involving genetically unrelated look-alikes, U-LAs) explores associations among resemblance in appearance, the Big Five personality traits, self-esteem, and social attraction within an evolutionary framework. The Personality for Professionals Inventory (PfPI), NEO/NEO-FFI-3, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a Social Relationship Survey were variously completed by 45 U-LA pairs, identified from the “I’m Not a Look-Alike” project, Mentorn Media, and personal referrals. The mean U-LA intraclass correlations were negligible for all Big Five personality traits on the PfPI and NEO/NEO-FFI-3 (ri = −.02 and −.04, respectively). In contrast, mean ri values of.53 and.15 for monozygotic (MZA) and dizygotic (DZA) reared-apart twins, respectively, have been reported for these personality measures. The U-LA self-esteem correlation (ri = −.18) was also below the correlations reported for MZ and DZ reared-together twins (ri =.31 and.13, respectively). Finally, far fewer U-LAs expressed close social relationships (20%) than MZA (80%) and DZA (65%) twins. The present study extends earlier findings indicating that appearance is not meaningfully related to personality similarity and social relatedness. The criticism that MZ twins are alike in personality because their matched looks invite similar treatment by others is refuted. A more judicious interpretation is reactive genotype-environment correlation, namely that MZ twins’ similar personalities evoke similar reactions from others. MZ twins’ close social relations most likely derive from their perceptions of genetically based within-pair similarities that are lacking in U-LAs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dizygotic; Look-alikes; Monozygotic; Personality; Self-esteem; Twins","adult; article; controlled study; female; genotype; human; human experiment; male; perception; self esteem; social interaction","Segal, N.L.; Department of Psychology, California State University, 800 N.

Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the “socioecological environment,” which could explain variation in fitness. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment. © 2017 The Authors.

The evolution of competitive ability, in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits. The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i) whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE will therefore reduce evolutionary potential. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree, centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in 3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers of social behavior. ©The Author(s) 2017.

We report two key findings. First, perch vulnerability was strongly related to a repeatable habitat choice behaviour, but unrelated to swimming activity as a personality trait; importantly, highly vulnerable perch were captured throughout the lake and not only in their preferred habitat, suggesting covariance between spatial habitat choice and a behavioural determinant of vulnerability. Second, catch per unit effort of large perch increased with self-reported angling skill, an effect unrelated to skill-dependent lure use or an angler’s ability to encounter perch. Importantly, high-skill anglers captured more fish but not different spatial behavioural phenotypes.

Consistent individual differences in foraging strategies have been found in temperate seabirds, but it is unclear whether such foraging special-isation would be beneficial in unpredictable tropical pelagic waters. We examined whether foraging trip characteristics of a tropical seabird were consistent between seasons and within individuals and explored whether seasonal changes could be explained by environmental variables. Ascension frigatebird Fregata aquila trips lasted up to 18 d and covered a total travel distance of up to 7047 km, but adult frigatebirds stayed within a radius of 1150 km of Ascension Island. We found that the 50% utilisation distribution of the population expanded southwestward in the cool season due to individuals performing more and longer trips in a southerly and westerly direction during the cool compared to the hot season. Individual repeatability was low (R < 0.25) for all trip characteristics, and we were unable to explain seasonal changes in time spent at sea using oceanographic or atmospheric variables. Instead, frigatebird usage per area was almost exclusively determined by distance from the colony, and although individuals spent more time in distant portions of their foraging trips, the amount of time spent per unit area decreased exponentially with increasing distance from the colony.

It has long been suggested that these traits co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study, we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e. activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing. Compared with the oncefed group, the twice-fed group showed higher feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between metabolism and growth.

Females also express such traits but our understanding about why is limited. Intraspecific aggression between females might be used to gain access to reproductive resources but simultaneously incurs costs in terms of energy and time available for reproductive activities, resulting in a trade-off. Although consistent individual differences in female behaviour (i.e. personality) like aggressiveness are likely to influence these reproductive trade-offs, little is known about the consistency of aggressiveness in females. To quantify aggression we presented a female decoy to free-living female great tits (Parus major) during the egg-laying period, and assessed whether they were consistent in their response towards this decoy. Moreover, we assessed whether female aggression related to consistent individual differences in exploration behaviour in a novel environment. We found that females consistently differed in aggressiveness, although first-year females were on average more aggressive than older females. Moreover, conform life history theory predictions, 'fast' exploring females were more aggressive towards the decoy than 'slow' exploring females. Given that personality traits are often heritable, and correlations between behaviours can constrain short term adaptive evolution, our findings highlight the importance of studying female aggression within a multivariate behavioural framework. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"aggressiveness; case report; egg laying; exploratory behavior; female; human; life history; nonhuman; Parus major; personality; prediction; quantitative study; theoretical model","Thys, B.; Department of Biology, Behavioural Ecology and Ecophysiology Group, University of AntwerpBelgium; email: bert.thys@uantwerpen.be",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,,"English","Sci.

However, little is known about the causes of variation in the repeatability of behavioral differences among species because rarely have comparative studies been undertaken to examine the repeatability of behavioral differences among individuals within their natural ecological settings. Using two species of endemic subtropical anemonefishes, Amphiprion mccullochi and A. latezonatus at Lord Howe and North Solitary Islands, Australia, we conducted an in situ comparative analysis of personality traits, examining the repeatability of boldness, sociability and aggression as well as the potential role of environmental and social factors on behavioral expression. For A. mccullochi, only boldness and aggression were highly repeatable and these behaviors formed a behavioral syndrome. For A. latezonatus, none of the three behaviors were repeatable due to low-inter-individual variation in behavior. We suggest that the harsher and more variable environmental and social conditions experienced by A. latezonatus have resulted in reduced repeatability in behavior, in contrast to A. mccullochi which typically inhabits a more stable lagoonal reef environment. Additionally, group size and size rank, rather than nearest-neighbor distance and anemone size, influenced the expression of these behaviors in both species, suggesting that behavioral variation was more sensitive to social than environmental factors. Overall, differences in repeatability between these closely related species likely reflect adaptations to contrasting environmental and social conditions, although alternative explanations must be considered. The differences in behavioral consistency between these two endemic anemonefishes could lead to disparity in their resilience to environmental or social change in the future. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Aggression; Amphiprion; Boldness; Clownfish; Coral Reef; Sociability","adaptation; aggression; assessment method; behavioral response; coastal lagoon; comparative study; coral reef; endemic species; environmental factor; eusociality; fitness; group size; perciform; reef; social change; species conservation; subtropical region; Australia; Lord Howe Island; New South Wales; North Solitary Island; Amphiprion; Amphiprion latezonatus; Amphiprion mccullochi; Anemone; Animalia; Anthozoa","Wong, M.Y.L.; Centre for Sustainable Ecosystems Solutions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Wollongong, Northfields Avenue, Australia; email: marianw@uow.edu.au",,"Springer Verlag",07224028,,CORFD,,"English","Coral Reefs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029802705

Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity–boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","behavioural syndrome; boldness; ERA; esfenvalerate; personality; repeatability; urbanization","anthropogenic effect; behavioral response; biomechanics; community dynamics; damselfly; dose-response relationship; induced response; pesticide; phenotype; population viability analysis; psychology; sublethal effect; urbanization; Animalia; Coenagrion puella; Zygoptera","Tüzün, N.; Evolutionary Stress Ecology and Ecotoxicology, University of Leuven, Charles Deberiotstraat, 32, Belgium; email: nedim.tuzun@kuleuven.be",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Yet, it has been hypothesised that animals should cope with cyclical fluctuations by adjusting both single behaviours and suites of behaviour. Photoperiod is well known to induce hormonal and physiological changes, and these changes can in turn affect personality traits and behavioural profiles. This study is the first to explicitly investigate the influence of photoperiod on both behavioural profiles and personality traits. Six potential personality traits (within-flock activity, ability to escape, response to threat, isolation calling, boldness and neophobia) and dominance were measured four times in 96 domestic canaries Serinus canaria (48 males and 48 females): twice during a long photoperiod (Long Days) and 6 months later twice during a short photoperiod (Short Days). Without regard to sex and photoperiod, most traits were highly repeatable, and bolder canaries were more dominant, less sensitive to an external threat and to isolation and less neophobic. In addition, the more active individuals within a flock were the more difficult to catch. Yet, both sex and photoperiod affected personality traits and behavioural profiles. Personality traits remained repeatable within each photoperiod though we observed behavioural plasticity and sex differences for response to threat, neophobia and within-flock activity. Concerning behavioural profiles, the negative relationship between boldness and neophobia remained homogenous in both sexes during Short Days as well as during Long Days. Then, the more active individuals within a flock were the more difficult to catch in Short Days but not in Long Days. Finally, the other correlations not only varied with photoperiod but also with sex. Our study highlights the importance of photoperiod and sex in the expression of personality traits and behavioural profiles, and of the need to measure them across the whole photoperiodic cycle. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","behavioural profile; domestic canary; personality traits; photoperiod; repeatability","adult; behavioral response; domestic species; dominance; homogeneity; induced response; photoperiod; physiological response; physiology; plasticity; psychology; sex hormone; songbird; Animalia; Serinus canaria","Amy, M.; Laboratoire Ethologie Cognition Développement, EA 3456, Université Paris NanterreFrance; email: mathieu.amy@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033484903

One clear example of this is the collective motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to experimental data. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each case. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level repeatability of the underlying traits. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals. Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments, and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence social behaviour. © 2017 The Authors.

Such effects are often more strongly expressed when individuals are simultaneously exposed to other stress sources. Consequently, the behaviour of virgin and mated individuals often differs. Mated females, for example, search for suitable oviposition sites, whereas virgin females search more for mates. In the present study, we examine the effect of mating separately for females and males on four key behaviours of the red flour beetles: movement activity, movement along the edges of an arena, latency to emerge from shelter and preference for dark microhabitat. After mating, both sexes increase their activity at the same time as moving less along the arena edge, leading to a change in movement pattern. Females possibly change their movement pattern to locate suitable oviposition sites, whereas males perhaps do so to detect additional females with which to mate. Latency to emerge from shelter and dark preference are not influenced by mating, although they increase when measured again after 1 week. Of these behaviours, only movement activity is consistent at the individual level. We also examine whether mating incurs a cost as expressed in the time required to recover from a chill-coma.

To test this hypothesis, we used juvenile common-garden reared carp (Cyprinus carpio) within a narrow size range to investigate the mechanistic basis of behavioral selection caused by angling. We focused on one key personality trait (i.e., boldness), measured in groups within ponds, two morphological traits (body shape and head shape), and one life-history trait (juvenile growth capacity) and studied mean standardized selection gradients caused by angling. Carp behavior was highly repeatable within ponds. In the short term, over seven days of fishing, total length, not boldness, was the main predictor of angling vulnerability. However, after 20 days of fishing, boldness turned out to be the main trait under selection, followed by juvenile growth rate, while morphological traits were only weakly related to angling vulnerability. In addition, we found juvenile growth rate to be moderately correlated with boldness. Hence, direct selection on boldness will also induce indirect selection on juvenile growth and vice versa, but given that the two traits are not perfectly correlated, independent evolution of both traits is also possible. Our study is among the first to mechanistically reveal that energy-acquisition-related behaviors, and not growth rate per se, are key factors determining the probability of capture, and hence, behavioral traits appear to be the prime targets of angling selection. We predict an evolutionary response toward increased shyness in intensively angling-exploited fish stocks, possibly causing the emergence of a timidity syndrome. © 2017 The Authors.

State-dependence theory suggests that behaviour is ‘anchored’ to individual state (e.g. body condition, gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments. Risk-taking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found significant between-individual correlation only in the low food × long basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size ( age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural predictability, but not in behavioural type. © 2017 Horváth et al.

In this study, we used social networks to examine variation in individual social behaviour in wild Grant's gazelles, Nanger granti, and explored potential drivers and consequences of this variation. First, we quantified two aspects of individual network position (weighted degree and closeness) on a monthly basis for 12 consecutive months and examined life-history (age) and abiotic (rainfall) factors that could explain among-individual variation in network position. Next, we examined the level of within-individual repeatability in network position over time. We then tested for potential consequences of this variation focusing on parasite infection and diet quality. Rainfall and age were strong predictors of variation in closeness but not degree. Interestingly, we found that one aspect of individual network position (closeness) varied over time, while another (degree) was moderately repeatable. The difference in within-individual repeatability of the two measures may be explained by the dependence of closeness on rainfall. In addition, we found that individual network position had consequences for both parasitism and diet, but the magnitude and direction of these effects depended on parasite type, connectivity measure and environmental conditions. Overall, our results suggest that environmental and host factors strongly influence variability in certain aspects of social connectivity in Grant's gazelles, and that abiotic and biotic forces, together, mediate the consequences of social network position. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","diet quality; Grant's gazelle; group living; parasite infection; social connectivity; social network analysis","age; connectivity; diet; group behavior; individual variation; life history trait; network analysis; parasite infestation; parasitism; qualitative analysis; rainfall; social network; social structure; ungulate; Gazella","Williams, A.E.; Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, 140 E.

The objective of this study was to investigate reliability and validity aspects of four selected behavioural measures at the feeding gate (BM) and to compare them with existing breeding traits and with observations of cows’ behaviour during milking. This included the analysis of criterion validity at animal and at herd level and of repeatability of the BM over time. Data on avoidance distances (AD), tolerance to tactile interaction (TTI), release behaviour (RB), and qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were collected on a total of 33 dairy farms. The breeding traits average milk flow (AMF), milking speed (MS), and milking temperament (MT) had been recorded per test-day or during linear description by milk testing or breeding associations. Inter- and intra-test associations were investigated by Spearman rank or Pearson correlation analysis. At animal level, significant correlations of different strengths were found within BM ranging from rs = 0.28 (p &lt; 0.01, n = 1890) between AD and TTI to rs = 0.74 (p &lt; 0.01, n = 582) between RB and QBA, and between MS and MT (rs = 0.62, p &lt; 0.01, n = 269). No significant correlations were found between BM and breeding traits. For analyses at herd level, medians and percentages of certain categories were calculated and the average number of stepping (STEP) and kicking (KICK) per cow during milking was recorded. Between all BM closer correlations were found than at animal level. STEP correlated with KICK (rs = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01, n = 24), while no further significant correlations were found between BM, STEP or KICK and breeding traits. For analysis of repeatability BM were applied repeatedly on three farms following a three-week interval. Correlations ranged from rs = 0.33 (p &lt; 0.01, n = 67) for TTI to rs = 0.73 (p &lt; 0.01, n = 23) for QBA. Apparently, behavioural measures at the feeding gate reflect partly similar and partly different aspects of cows’ responsiveness towards humans. The present study underlines methodological problems that exist with MT and MS, and questions the relationship between milkability, milking behaviour and responsiveness in the barn. The analyses show that AD, TTI, and RB appear to be vulnerable to short- or mid-term influences. Overall, QBA turned out to be a promising measure for breeding and welfare assessment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Breeding traits; Dairy cattle; Human-animal relationship; Reliability; Validity","animal welfare; breeding; cattle; comparative study; correlation; milk production; nature-society relations; reliability analysis; reproductive strategy; Animalia; Bos","Ebinghaus, A.; Section of Farm Animal Behaviour and Husbandry, Faculty of Organic Agricultural Sciences, University of Kassel, Witzenhausen, Germany; email: ebinghaus@uni-kassel.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

However, behavioural plasticity and the adjustment of behaviours to new environments have been a classical explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or behavioural plasticity is responsible for the nonrandom distribution of shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age. Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of developmental plasticity) shaping whatwe refer to as ‘personality’. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of personalitymediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat choice has important implications for population management and conservation. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Older adult norms may consist of typically aging or healthy aging individuals according to the stringency of the exclusion criteria, a difference illustrated when comparing two normative samples for the RBANS: the original standardization sample and the Oklahoma sample. Methods: The current study examined the clinical impact of norm selection in older adults by analyzing impairment classification rates for 105 older adult behavioral health inpatients. Rates of impaired performance (scaled score ≤4 or its normalized equivalent) were compared across RBANS subtests using standardization sample vs. Oklahoma sample normative data in patients aged 70–79 (n = 57) and 80–89 (n = 48). Results: Across most RBANS subtests, utilization of the original standardization sample vs. Oklahoma sample norms resulted in a greater proportion of individuals classified as impaired. These findings occurred across both age groups and persevered when holding constant the sample normalization process. Overall, use of the standardization sample vs. Oklahoma sample normative data were 1–11 times more likely to indicate impairment, with one of the more notable differences seen on the Coding subtest in the 80–89 sample (65% vs. 8% labeled as impaired). Conclusions: Sample composition and exclusionary criteria require consideration when selecting an appropriate normative sample against which to compare older adult test performance.

We measured feeding latencies of fish in four contexts: in a novel environment; in an environment with refuge and predators; in the presence of a shoal; and in the presence of a shoal and predators. The population from a high-flow and high-predation habitat was significantly bolder than populations from low-predation and low-flow/stagnant habitats. Individuals were significantly bolder in the presence of shoal and predators than in the other contexts. In general, males were significantly bolder than females. Smaller individuals took greater risks to feed than larger individuals only within two populations. The high-predation, high-flow habitat fish also showed significantly lower between- and within-individual variation in boldness than all the low-predation and low-flow populations. Furthermore, we found significantly repeatable responses across contexts within all populations, indicating behavioral consistency. Differences in response to variations in experimental contexts and stress and individual differences in metabolic rates could possibly explain the observed between- and within-individual variation among populations.","body-size; predation; repeatability; risk-taking; sex; water-flow","animal; animal behavior; ecosystem; environment; high risk behavior; physiology; population density; predation; zebra fish; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Environment; Population Density; Predatory Behavior; Risk-Taking; Zebrafish",,,,15578542,,,"28737485","English","Zebrafish",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040660900

For anadromous fishes requiring access to spawning habitat above obstructions, successful passage at fishways may at least in part be a function of an individual's behavioural type. The objectives of this study were to determine whether distinct behavioural types—bold and shy—could be distinguished within a population of anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and, if so, whether passage success at a nature-like fishway varied relative to behavioural type. Field-caught rainbow smelt were tested for individual differences in boldness (i.e., willingness to engage in risk-taking behaviour) using the metrics of exploratory behaviour, general activity, and response to a simulated predator. After testing, 276 rainbow smelt were implanted with a passive integrated transponder tag, released below the fishway, and their movements monitored via a stationary antenna array. The results of our behavioural assays indicated the presence of a behavioural syndrome among rainbow smelt, and that behaviour was partially repeatable. In total, 41.7% of fish entering the fishway passed successfully, but contrary to our initial prediction, boldness was not a significant predictor of successful passage. Instead, increasing water temperature and decreasing river discharge were consistent predictors of successful passage and greater distances moved through the fishway. Our findings indicate that the nature-like fishway did not select for a particular behavioural type and that individuals representing the spectrum of bold–shy behavioural types could pass.

Social insects, whose learning abilities have been extensively characterized, show consistent behavioral variability, both at colony and at individual level. We investigated the possible link between personality traits and learning performance in the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops. Exploratory activity, sociability, and aggression were assessed twice in ant foragers. Behaviors differed among individuals, they were partly repeatable across time and exploratory activity correlated positively with aggression. Learning abilities were quantified by differential conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response, a task that requires cue perception and information storage. We found that exploratory activity of individual ants significantly predicted learning performance: ""active-explorers"" were slower in learning the task than ""inactive-explorers"".

Animal personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences that are repeatable across time and context) can influence parasitism with more explorative individuals typically hosting greater parasite loads. Host “sociality” is known to impact parasite risk with more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2 years at a site in southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality. More exploratory individuals hosted a greater abundance of ectoparasites compared to less exploratory individuals. Our results are consistent with past studies implicating personality as a factor in host–parasite dynamics and suggest that exploration may be an important behavioral correlate of parasite acquisition. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","behavior; consistent individual differences; host–parasite dynamics; least chipmunk; repeatability","abundance; abundance estimation; behavioral response; ectoparasite; host-parasite interaction; individual variation; parasite prevalence; parasite transmission; parasitism; prediction; rodent; Canada; Manitoba; Animalia; Sciuridae; Tamias minimus","Bohn, S.J.; Department of Biology, University of ReginaCanada; email: shelbyjbohn@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029602008

However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length, mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25) that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of information can be conveyed to the receivers. Significance statement: We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because individuals that changed residency between days sang with less consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Acoustic communication; Good gene models of sexual selection; Mate choice; Mixed models; Personality; Plasticity","bioacoustics; communication behavior; ecological modeling; environmental change; environmental effect; individual variation; long-term change; mate choice; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; sensitivity analysis; sexual selection; signaling; songbird; Aves; Ficedula albicollis","Garamszegi, L.Z.; Department of Evolutionary Ecology, Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC, c/ Americo Vespucio 26, Spain; email: laszlo.garamszegi@ebd.csic.es",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Longitudinal behavioural assessments offer an alternative. We modelled longitudinal observational data on shelter dog behaviour using the framework of behavioural reaction norms, partitioning variance into personality (i.e. inter-individual differences in behaviour), plasticity (i.e. inter-individual differences in average behaviour) and predictability (i.e. individual differences in residual intraindividual variation). We analysed data on interactions of 3263 dogs (n = 19 281) with unfamiliar people during their first month after arrival at the shelter. Accounting for personality, plasticity (linear and quadratic trends) and predictability improved the predictive accuracy of the analyses compared to models quantifying personality and/or plasticity only. While dogs were, on average, highly sociable with unfamiliar people and sociability increased over days since arrival, group averages were unrepresentative of all dogs and predictions made at the individual level entailed considerable uncertainty. Effects of demographic variables (e.g. age) on personality, plasticity and predictability were observed. Behavioural repeatability was higher one week after arrival compared to arrival day. Our results highlight the value of longitudinal assessments on shelter dogs and identify measures that could improve the predictive validity of behavioural assessments in shelters. © 2017 The Authors.","Behavioural reaction norms; Behavioural repeatability; Human-animal interactions; Inter- and intra-individual differences; Longitudinal behavioural assessment",,"Goold, C.; Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences, Faculty of Biosciences, Norwegian University of Life SciencesNorway; email: conor.goold@nmbu.no",,"Royal Society Publishing",20545703,,,,"English","R.

We measured shyness–boldness and exploration–avoidance for the first time in naked-footed mice (Peromyscus nudipes) in two adjacent habitats with differing level of disturbance in Costa Rica. Each habitat was measured in different, consecutive years. With these data, we explored the possibility of habitat differences in individual- and population-level behavioral plasticity, magnitude of behavior, and consistency. Mice in both habitats behaved consistently across time with high repeatability (i.e., showed personality). The strength of consistency of shyness–boldness and exploration–avoidance over time was higher in the disturbed habitat, and individuals in the undisturbed habitat were bolder and less exploratory. Behaviors were correlated with each other in both habitats, indicating that behavioral syndromes do not always break down in disturbed areas. Mice changed the magnitude of their response the second time they were tested, indicating population-level plasticity. There was also greater individual plasticity among mice in the undisturbed habitat. Our study suggests the possibility that habitat disturbance can affect behavioral plasticity and personality and that shyer/more exploratory individuals might colonize and/or persist in disturbed habitats.

However, seasonal partial migrations are increasingly recognised to be mediated by a combination of reversible plasticity in response to environmental variation and individual variation due to genetic and environmental effects. Here, we test the hypothesis that while partial diel migration heterogeneity occurs primarily due to short-term within-individual flexibility in behaviour, long-term individual differences in migratory behaviour also underpin this migration variation. Specifically, we use a hierarchical behavioural reaction norm approach to partition within- and among-individual variation in depth use and diel plasticity in depth use, across short- and long-term time-scales, in a group of 47 burbot (Lota lota) tagged with depth-sensing acoustic telemetry transmitters. We found that within-individual variation at the among-dates-within-seasons and among-seasons scale, explained the dominant proportion of phenotypic variation. However, individuals also repeatedly differed in their expression of migration behaviour over the 2 year study duration. These results reveal that diel migration variation occurs primarily due to short-term within-individual flexibility in depth use and diel migration behaviour. However, repeatable individual differences also played a key role in mediating partial diel migration. These findings represent a significant advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms generating the important, yet poorly understood phenomena of partial diel migration. Moreover, given the pervasive occurrence of diel migrations across aquatic taxa, these findings indicate that individual differences have an important, yet previously unacknowledged role in structuring the temporal and vertical dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the magnitude of between- and within-subject variation of the pupillary unrest index (PUI) in a sample of healthy individuals. Materials and methods: The present data were collected within the framework of a mobile phone study on possible effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) on the central nervous system. Pupillary behavior was monitored in 30 young healthy male volunteers (age 18–30 years) on ten non-consecutive experimental days at 11:00 a.m. and 04:00 p.m., using infrared video pupillography (compact integrated pupillograph, CIP). Since RF-EMF had no impact on the PUI, data were pooled for the present analysis. Results: Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed that the PUI was subject to higher interindividual variation as compared to intraindividual variation at both times of measurement. This resulted in intraclass correlation coefficients pointing to a substantial stability of these interindividual differences. A comparison of the PUI results with currently used cutoff values revealed that more than 50% of recordings from young, healthy, non-sleep-disturbed males showed values beyond the “normal” range. Conclusion: The significant interindividual variability implies that the PUI is not only a state marker. Evaluations of such measurements should therefore consider the PUI as a possible trait marker to ensure comparability and correct interpretation. © 2017, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH.","Alertness; Daytime sleepiness; Pupillography; Trait marker; Vigilance","adult; Article; central nervous system; comparative study; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dark adaptation; electromagnetism; Epworth sleepiness scale; eye movement; human; human experiment; male; mobile phone; normal human; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; pupil; pupillary unrest index; pupillograph; pupillography; radiofrequency; visual system parameters","Eggert, T.; Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Competence Centre of Sleep Medicine, Charitéplatz 1, Germany; email: torsten.eggert@charite.de",,"Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH and Co.

Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny. The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However, the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare. Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation, albeit at different time points in males and females. This period of the life cycle merits systematic examination across taxa. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","animal personality; behavioral consistency; behavioral syndromes; life history","aggression; behavioral response; juvenile; life cycle; life history trait; maturation; ontogeny; predator; selection; sexual maturity; social behavior; spider; Agelenidae; Agelenopsis; Animalia; Araneae; Dipluridae","Bosco, J.M.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of TennesseeUnited States; email: jbosco@vols.utk.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021739460

Repeatability is underpinned by developmental plasticity and genetic variation but may become biased upwards by repeatable differences in environments to which individuals respond plastically. The extent of upward bias caused by the latter mechanism (causing “pseudo-repeatability”) is important yet rarely investigated in ecological research. We repeatedly assayed a key behaviour (flight initiation distance) affecting longevity in a wild cricket population (Gryllus campestris). We used naturally moving, translocated and forced-stationary individuals to study bias in repeatability caused by spatial variability in environmental conditions. Our experiments acknowledged that translocations might themselves bias repeatability estimates if animals respond to handling procedures (a necessary component of translocations). Individuals were, therefore, either (i) repeatedly translocated and assayed or (ii) assayed at multiple burrows as part of natural movements. This enabled estimation of behavioural variance attributable to individual, burrow and residual components within each treatment; comparison across treatments addressed whether translocations caused bias. We also calculated repeatability for individuals that were forced to be stationary to investigate whether this led to upward bias of repeatability. For adult crickets, individual explained 17.8% versus 17.2%, and burrow 8.7% versus 10.3%, of the behavioural variance in translocated versus natural-movement treatments. Repeatability for forced-stationary adults was 31.1%, thereby demonstrating experimentally that certain study designs bias repeatability upwards. For translocated juveniles, individual explained 10.0% and burrow 6.0% of the variance, while in the natural-movement treatment, those components could not be separated as juveniles do not switch burrows. Translocations did not lead to detectable biases in behavioural mean or variance. Repeatability was not biased for adults subjected to the natural-movement treatment because individuals were assayed under many different environments, facilitating the separation of individual from burrow effects. Upward bias would have occurred with less optimal sampling schemes: if individuals had been assayed repeatedly at the same burrow. We, therefore, recommend that translocation experiments are more commonly applied, particularly in stationary species, to ensure the unbiased estimation of repeatability. © 2017 The Authors.

They are often associated in personality-dependent dispersal, and both have major but underappreciated consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In addition, changes in animal personality can appear through ontogeny, leading to life stage-dependent behaviours. We investigated relationships between dispersal, life stage and boldness in an invertebrate with between- and within-life stages variation in dispersal tendency, the land snail Cornu aspersum. Latency to exit the shell following a simulated attack was repeatable, indicating boldness is a personality trait in Cornu aspersum. Subadults were bolder and more dispersive than adults. Dispersers were bolder than non-dispersers, independently of boldness changes between life stages.

Recent work combining animal personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels relative to those with slower life-history strategies, but empirical tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life-history strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue-flick rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials. Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors, such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges. Thus, we offer evidence that behaviour is an important component of co-evolved suites of traits forming a general pace-of-life continuum in this system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Habituation; Hidden Markov model; Movement; Pace-of-life syndrome; Predation; Thamnophis elegans; Tongue flicks","ecotype; evolutionarily stable strategy; habituation; life history; life history trait; Markov chain; movement; phenotype; physiology; predation; snake; adult; animal behavior; Article; environmental factor; movement (physiology); nonhuman; snake; tongue; animal; Colubridae; female; habituation; lifestyle; male; Markov chain; physiology; sex factor; Animalia; Serpentes; Thamnophis; Thamnophis elegans; Animals; Colubridae; Female; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Life Style; Male; Markov Chains; Movement; Sex Factors; Tongue","Sparkman, A.M.; Amanda Sparkman Biology Department Westmont College, 955 La Paz Rd., United States; email: sparkman@westmont.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"28648696","English","Behav.

However, environmental effects on the behavioural phenotype and repeatability are rather unexplored for holometabolous insects in their larval stage. We examined the effects of the food environment (young versus old cabbage leaves) and previous test experience on growth and behaviour of Phaedon cochleariae larvae. A more nutritious diet, i.e., young leaves, had beneficial consequences on larval growth. Contrary to findings on adults, the behaviour of larvae was neither consistent over time nor across contexts, thus larvae did not show personality. Furthermore, larval behaviour was shaped independent of the diet, pointing to a stage-dependent receptivity towards diet conditions in this species. Besides, larval activity was significantly influenced by former test experience, with naïve larvae being more active than previously tested larvae. In general, in insects memories in an olfactory or sexual behaviour context can lead to behavioural responses later in life. Mechanisms of memory-learning should be further explored in different contexts in insects. Overall, the present study reveals that growth-related traits are diet-dependent and that the activity of a holometabolous larva is shaped in dependence of its previous test experience. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Activity; Body mass; Development time; Memory-learning-mechanism; Personality; Phaedon cochleariae","beetle; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; bioactivity; biological development; body mass; diet; growth; host plant; host quality; larva; larval development; learning; memory; olfaction; phenotype; sexual behavior; timescale; adult; cabbage; Chrysomelidae; diet; female; human; human experiment; larva; learning; male; memory; nonhuman; personality; Phaedon cochleariae; phenotype; sexual behavior; species; animal; beetle; Brassica; diet; larva; phenotype; physiology; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Hexapoda; Phaedon cochleariae; Animals; Brassica; Coleoptera; Diet; Larva; Phenotype","Müller, T.; Department of Chemical Ecology, Bielefeld University, Universitätsstr. 25, Germany; email: thorben.mueller@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"28552703","English","Behav.

An outstanding question is whether individual reaction norm (RN) slopes are consistent across different environmental variables—that is, whether an individual that is highly responsive to one environmental variable will be equally responsive to a second variable. Another important and related question is whether RNs are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and food availability that were repeated in discrete ‘bursts’ of sampling through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time for both temperature (Rslope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses (Rslope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment (Rintercept = 0.83). Despite the high potential lability of behaviour, we have demonstrated consistency of behavioural RN components and identified potential energetic constraints leading to high consistency of thermal RNs and low consistency of food deprivation RNs. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The notion that behavioral flexibility facilitates exploitation of urban environments has received mixed support, but recent studies propose that between-individual differences are important. We leverage existing knowledge on three species of orb-web spider (Araneidae, Araneae) whose abundances differ along an urban–rural gradient to test predictions about between- and within-species/individual behavioral variation. We sampled Larinioides sclopetarius from their urban environment, and two species from suburban environments, Zygiella x-notata and Nuctenea umbratica. For each species, we quantified activity in a novel environment and within-species aggression. We analyzed between- and within-individual variation in behavior as well as their repeatability and correlations. As predicted, L. sclopetarius exhibited the highest activity in a novel environment and N. umbratica the lowest. Across all species, males were more aggressive than females and Z. x-notata was the most aggressive, followed by L. sclopetarius and N. umbratica. For all species, between-individual differences in activity and aggressiveness were repeatable; but the two behaviors were not correlated for any species. We next tested how group composition in relation to aggressiveness affects survival in high density conditions. Groups of Z. x-notata consisting of aggressive and tolerant spiders had higher survival rates than groups composed of only aggressive or tolerant individuals. Ultimately, we uncovered a complex pattern of behavioral variation between species as well as between and within individuals and we discuss the relative roles of this variation with respect to adapting to urban environments. Significance statement: Urbanization has drastically changed biodiversity patterns. While the majority of species cope poorly with urban habitats, some species flourish in cities. Our understanding of behavioral characteristics that facilitate this exploitation, however, remains poor. We explored between and within species and individual variation in behaviors in ecologically similar orb-weaving spider species whose abundances differ along the urban–rural gradient. We detect both consistent individual differences and plasticity, in individuals’ response to a novel environment, suggesting that some degree of flexibility in reaction to novelty may be crucial in an urbanized environment. We also found that variation in aggressiveness type enables survival in high density conditions, conditions typical for urban populations. Urban populations thus exhibit a complex pattern of behavioral flexibility and behavioral stability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Behavioral types; Group composition; Personality; Repeatability; Urbanization","abundance; aggression; behavioral response; biodiversity; individual variation; psychology; spider; tolerance; urban ecosystem; urbanization; Araneae; Araneidae; Larinioides sclopetarius","Kralj-Fišer, S.; Evolutionary Zoology Laboratory, Institute of Biology, Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Novi trg 2, Slovenia; email: simonakf@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Although behavioral coding is the most frequently utilized method for assessing primate personality, limitations in current statistical practice prevent researchers’ from utilizing the full potential of their coding datasets. These limitations include the use of extensive data aggregation, not modeling biologically relevant sources of individual variance during repeatability estimation, not partitioning between-individual (co)variance prior to modeling personality structure, the misuse of principal component analysis, and an over-reliance upon exploratory statistical techniques to compare personality models across populations, species, and data collection methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for primate personality research designed to address these limitations. Our framework synthesizes recently developed mixed-effects modeling approaches for quantifying behavioral variation with an information-theoretic model selection paradigm for confirmatory personality research. After detailing a multi-step analytic procedure for personality assessment and model comparison, we employ this framework to evaluate seven models of personality structure in zoo-housed bonobos (Pan paniscus). We find that differences between sexes, ages, zoos, time of observation, and social group composition contributed to significant behavioral variance. Independently of these factors, however, personality nonetheless accounted for a moderate to high proportion of variance in average behavior across observational periods. A personality structure derived from past rating research receives the strongest support relative to our model set. This model suggests that personality variation across the measured behavioral traits is best described by two correlated but distinct dimensions reflecting individual differences in affiliation and sociability (Agreeableness) as well as activity level, social play, and neophilia toward non-threatening stimuli (Openness). These results underscore the utility of our framework for quantifying personality in primates and facilitating greater integration between the behavioral ecological and comparative psychological approaches to personality research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bonobo; factor analysis; mixed model; personality; social behavior","assessment method; behavioral ecology; comparative study; empirical analysis; eusociality; factor analysis; hominid; individual variation; social behavior; statistical analysis; Pan paniscus; Primates; animal; Pan paniscus; personality; personality assessment; social behavior; Animals; Pan paniscus; Personality; Personality Assessment; Social Behavior","Martin, J.S.; Department of Anthropology, Emory UniversityUnited States; email: jsm.primatology@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",02752565,,AJPTD,"28427115","English","Am.

Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4–10 months, 10 months–3 years, 3–6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate “aggressive personality” trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general. © 2017 Goold, Newberry.

Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Few studies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40% of the between- individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","amphibian; animal personality; anuran; behavioural syndromes; body size; state dependence","age; behavioral ecology; body size; frog; individual variation; innate behavior; metabolism; social behavior; Amphibia; Animalia; Anura; Pseudophryne corroboree","Kelleher, S.R.; Centre for Sustainable Ecosystem Solutions, School of Biological Sciences, University of WollongongAustralia; email: srk649@uowmail.edu.au",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Despite much research on population-level foraging decisions, few studies have investigated individual differences in fine-scale daily foraging patterns among wild animals. Here, we explore the consistency and plasticity of feeding tactics of individual great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), using a grid of 65 automated feeding stations in a 385-ha woodland, during three winters. We use a principal component analysis to describe individual variation in six feeding parameters and examine how these differences covary with dominance-linked attributes (species, age and sex), the personality trait ‘exploration behaviour’, distance to territory and local competition intensity. Analysis of 933 086 feeder visits by 3134 individuals revealed that the majority of variation in the timing of feeding was explained by two principal components. PC1 (‘binge-eating’), accounting for 38% of variation, captured temporal clustering of feeding, with high repeatability both within and between years (r range: 0·42–0·55). PC2 (‘transience’), accounting for 27% of variance, described how much individuals used feeders and was also repeatable (r: 0·34–0·62). While exhibiting consistent individual differences, birds also showed flexibility in foraging patterns, binge-eating less and using feeders more when they experienced greater local competition. Individuals in behaviourally dominant states (great tits, males and adults) binged more than subordinate birds (blue tits, females and juveniles) when their territories were distant from feeding stations. Moreover, great tits and males used feeders more than blue tits and females respectively, while birds feeding further from their territory used feeders less than those feeding closer. ‘Exploration behaviour’ was unrelated to both measures of daily foraging behaviour. This study presents some of the first evidence that birds use consistent alternative foraging tactics at a fine temporal scale. Individuals are consistent in their tactics, and also adjust their foraging behaviour with changes in local competition. Hence, studies of foraging behaviour should consider the extent to which such individual-level variability in foraging behaviour is under selection. © 2017 The Authors.

A lack of detailed genetic information for wild populations has perpetuated assumptions regarding associations between individual differences in tool use and cognition and learning processes. However, captive birds and mammals can use tools in the absence of opportunities for social learning, indicating a genetic basis. Here, we used animal models and relatedness analysis to disentangle the role played by genetics and learning in tool use in an insular population of a long-lived vulture, Neophron percnopterus. Our results show a low heritability in this behaviour, perhaps because of the low variability observed among birds. However, not all individuals used stones to break eggs, and those that did so behaved consistently. Importantly, there was no evidence of learning at the timescale considered. Our results suggest that repeatability in tool use within individuals may indicate a link with some personality traits, with strong evolutionary and ecological consequences. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","Bayesian models; Egyptian vulture; heritability; learning; MCMCglmm; relatedness","Bayesian analysis; cognition; ecological modeling; heritability; individual variation; learning; raptor; relatedness; tool use; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Neophron percnopterus","Carrete, M.; Department of Physical, Chemical and Natural Systems, Universidad Pablo de OlavideSpain; email: mcarrete@upo.es",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Theoretical food webs have suggested that species-rich and highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence. Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research. Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new insights into community stability and biodiversity. © 2017 The Authors",,"Animalia",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00301299,,OIKSA,,"English","Oikos",Editorial,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018381877

However, examining the variation in behaviour among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk), (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness and IIV in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant differences in IIV among different individuals within the population. Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IIV in their boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results definitively demonstrate that IIV itself varies across individuals and is linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for behavioural interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Boldness; Intraindividual variability (IIV); North Island robins; Repeatability; Risk; Unpredictability","behavioral response; conspecific; evolution; intraspecific variation; passerine; risk assessment; animal experiment; Article; behavior change; bird; measurement repeatability; nonhuman; North Island robin; Passeriformes; prey; risk assessment; aggression; animal; feeding behavior; female; individuality; male; personality; physiology; predation; psychology; reproducibility; shyness; songbird; Aggression; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Female; Individuality; Male; Personality; Predatory Behavior; Reproducibility of Results; Shyness; Songbirds","Barnett, C.R.A.; Department of Zoology, Graduate School of Science, University of KyotoJapan; email: optimalforager@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"28454917","English","Behav.

The studies challenging the POLS hypothesis often focus on the relationships between a single personality trait and a physiological and/or life-history trait.

The aim of this study was to address this question in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a model species in immunity studies. The personality score was estimated from a multidimensional syndrome based of four repeatable behavioural traits. In a first experiment, we investigated its relationship with two measures of fitness (reproduction and survival) and three components of the innate immunity (haemocyte concentration, and levels of activity of the phenoloxidase including the total proenzyme and the naturally activated one) to challenge the POLS hypothesis in T. molitor. Overall, we found a relationship between behavioural syndrome and reproductive success in this species, thus supporting the POLS hypothesis. We also showed a sex-specific relationship between behavioural syndrome and basal immune parameters. In a second experiment, we tested whether this observed relationship with innate immunity could be confirmed in term of differential survival after challenging by entomopathogenic bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis. In this case, no significant relationship was evidenced. We recommend that future researchers on the POLS should control for differences in evolutionary trajectory between sexes and to pay attention to the choice of the proxy used, especially when looking at immune traits. © 2017 The Authors.

A major gap in our understanding is the neural basis for this link. Here we examine the stability and structure of behavioral, endocrine and neuroendocrine traits in a population of songbirds (Parus major). Upon identifying stable and covarying behavioral and endocrine traits, we test the hypothesis that risk-averse personalities exhibit a neuroendocrine stress axis that is systemically potentiated—characterized by stronger glucocorticoid reactivity and weaker negative feedback. We show high among-individual variation and covariation (i.e. personality) in risk-taking behaviors and demonstrate that four aspects of glucocorticoid physiology (baseline, stress response, negative feedback strength and adrenal sensitivity) are also repeatable and covary. Further, we establish that high expression of mineralocorticoid and low expression of glucocorticoid receptor in the brain are linked with systemically elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels and more risk-averse personalities. Our findings support the hypothesis that steroid hormones can exert pleiotropic effects that organize behavioral phenotypes and provide novel evidence that neuroendocrine factors robustly explain a large fraction of endocrine and personality variation. © 2017 The Authors","ACTH; Behavioral syndromes; Corticosterone; Dexamethasone; Glucocorticoid receptor; HPA axis; Mineralocorticoid receptor; Negative feedback; Personality; Stress","glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; mineralocorticoid; corticosterone; corticotropin; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; adult; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; aversive behavior; behavior assessment; biological trait; controlled study; corticosteroid blood level; endocrine function; female; intraspecific variation; male; negative feedback; neuroendocrine stress axis; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; Parus major; pleiotropy; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; stress; aggression; animal; blood; brain; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; mental stress; metabolism; neuroendocrine system; Passeriformes; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Corticosterone; Female; Glucocorticoids; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Neurosecretory Systems; Passeriformes; Phenotype; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; Stress, Psychological","Baugh, A.T.; Swarthmore College, Martin Biological Laboratory, 500 College Avenue, United States; email: abaugh1@swarthmore.edu",,"Academic Press Inc.",0018506X,,HOBEA,"28545898","English","Horm.

Data were collected at the Kutuharju Reindeer Research Station in Kaamanen, Finland, where measures of personality were generated using field observation data based on the relative frequency of dominant male–subdominant male agonistic interactions over 4 years and subdominant males' FID measured over 1 year. Individual propensity for transient mating attempts was not significantly repeatable and did not significantly predict reproductive success or somatic cost during the mating season. Individuals varied consistently in FID, and although repeatable, FID was not related to reproductive success or somatic cost.

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions has been proposed to maintain such variation but empirical evidences supporting this hypothesis are still scarce for behavioural traits. Here, we analysed the repeatability and the ecological and individual factors that influence the expression of docility across different environmental contexts in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) studied over a period of 10 years. We also estimated the heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age, was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at 0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only, individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival. Our study confirms that docility is both phenotypically and genetically variables and that disruptive selection might maintain the variability in this trait. Significance statement: Documenting the factors allowing the maintenance of phenotypic and genetic variation of behavioural traits within natural populations is a central objective in ecology and evolution. Here, we studied a wild eastern chipmunk population over 10 years and recorded docility, a personality trait, on both juveniles and adults. We showed that docility was repeatable and that it was also heritable and influenced by different individual and environmental factors. Importantly, we also found that disruptive viability selection was acting on adult docility independently of environmental variations. Our results show that docility is both phenotypically and genetically variable and that patterns of selection acting on this trait can maintain personality heterogeneity across temporally varying environmental conditions in the wild. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Docility; Heritability; Natural selection; Personality; Repeatability; Wild rodents","environmental conditions; genetic variation; heritability; heterogeneity; natural selection; rodent; survival; viability; Rodentia; Tamias striatus","Garant, D.; Département de Biologie, Université de SherbrookeCanada; email: Dany.Garant@USherbrooke.ca",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

It has been measured using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation. Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature). During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions) after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures, supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","experience; fear; learning; novelty; risk; shyness","behavioral response; experimental study; laboratory method; learning; risk factor; rodent; testing method; Mus; Rhabdomys pumilio","Yuen, C.H.; School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 1 Jan Smuts Avenue, Braamfontein, South Africa; email: commonpeople217@aol.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Genetic analyses indicate that the undescribed trematode species falls within the superfamily Microphalloidea. Results of laboratory behavioural tests indicate that the two behavioural traits are related to each other: bolder individuals also show higher levels of spontaneous activity than shy ones. However, parasite infection had no effect on either of these behaviours or on their repeatability over three separate testing sessions.

We use tightly controlled ontogenetic experiments with clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), to test whether near-identical rearing conditions and lack of social contact dampen individuality. In sharp contrast to our predictions, we find that (i) substantial individual variation in behaviour emerges among genetically identical individuals isolated directly after birth into highly standardized environments and (ii) increasing levels of social experience during ontogeny do not affect levels of individual behavioural variation.

Testosterone, through its pleiotropic effects, plays a crucial role in coordinating morphology, physiology and behavior in a reproductive context. The concentration of circulating testosterone, however, varies over the course of the day and in response to other internal or external stimuli, potentially making it difficult to relate testosterone sampled at one time point with traits of interest. Many researchers now utilize the administration of exogenous GnRH to elicit a standardized stimulation of testosterone secretion. However, it has remained unclear if and how this exogenously stimulated activation of the HPG axis is related with endogenously regulated testosterone that is capable of influencing testosterone related traits. Repeated measures of a hormone can uncover consistent individual variation in hormonal differences at the HPG axis level, variation that potentially stems from underlying genetic variation in a population experiencing identical environmental cues. Thus, we asked, using the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), how daily endogenous variation in testosterone profiles relates to GnRH-induced testosterone secretion. Further, we explore the relationship between endogenous daily testosterone peaks and GnRH-induced testosterone with badge size, a morphological trait related with status within a social group. We found that GnRH-induced testosterone levels reflect a highly repeatable hormonal phenotype that is strongly correlated with nighttime testosterone levels. The results demonstrate the usefulness of GnRH-induced testosterone in studies aimed at understanding individual variation and selection on endogenously regulated testosterone levels and the potential importance of nighttime testosterone levels to physiology and behavior. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Avian; Circadian; HPG axis; Reproductive fitness","gonadorelin; testosterone; gonadorelin; testosterone; animal experiment; Article; badge size; circadian rhythm; controlled study; male; morphological trait; nonhuman; Passer domesticus; reproductive fitness; testosterone blood level; testosterone release; animal; blood; circadian rhythm; physiology; reproduction; social environment; sparrow; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Male; Reproduction; Social Environment; Sparrows; Testosterone","Needham, K.B.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State UniversityUnited States; email: Katie.needham@ndsu.edu",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,"28017731","English","Gen.

However, such individuals might often be restless and thus excluded from RMR datasets, leading to a significant sampling bias. We tested (1) whether such a bias occurs when animals are measured for a relatively common but short time period of 3 h, and if so, (2) whether alternative measures of metabolic rate, that allow the incorporation of non-resting individuals, would reveal associations between metabolism and personality. For this, we studied free-living individuals of the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) both during the moist season (N = 25 individuals) with high food availability and the dry season (N = 48 individuals) with low food availability. We assessed variation in the latency to explore a novel object, and the time spent active and time spent in the centre of a neutral arena. We examined links between personality and (i) RMR and (ii) four alternative metabolic rate (MR) metrics: average MR, highest MR, lowest MR and span of MR. Twenty-nine percent of the measured individuals had to be excluded from our RMR study because they remained restless during respirometry trials. Striped mice showed a behavioural syndrome where fast explorers also spent more time in centre and more time active than slow explorers. Individuals that did not rest during respirometry trials were faster explorers and in the moist season, they were also more active and spent more time in the centre than individuals that rested. We found no relationship between RMR and the behavioural syndrome, which might be due to the exclusion of individuals with a certain behavioural type, leaving a subset of compliant individuals. In the moist season, we found positive relationships between the behavioural syndrome and span of MR and lowest MR. In the dry season, low food availability may mask links between the behavioural syndrome and alternative MR measures due to reduced overall activity in striped mice. Our study demonstrated the importance to consider personality when measuring RMR and suggests that some alternative MRs may be useful to examine relationships between metabolism and personality when it is impossible to measure individuals over extended time periods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alternative measures of metabolic rate; Average metabolic rate; Drought; Personality trait; Rodent","animal behavior; Article; biome; female; food availability; humidity; latent period; male; measurement repeatability; moisture; mouse; nonhuman; personality; priority journal; respirometry; resting metabolic rate; restlessness; Rhabdomys pumilio; season; winter; animal; basal metabolic rate; behavior; exploratory behavior; metabolism; nonparametric test; pathophysiology; physiology; principal component analysis; rest; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Behavioral Symptoms; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Male; Mice; Personality; Principal Component Analysis; Rest; Seasons; Statistics, Nonparametric","Rimbach, R.; University of the Witwatersrand, School of Animal, Plant & Environmental Sciences, Private Bag 3, WITS, South Africa; email: Rebecca.Rimbach@wits.ac.za",,"Elsevier Inc.",00319384,,PHBHA,"28283463","English","Physiol.

Repeated measures of hormones are valuable because repeatability in hormone levels might be a mechanism that drives repeatability in behavior (“personality”). Testosterone is predicted to promote territorial aggression and suppress parental behaviors. In our population of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), parental care and nest defense aggression toward a heterospecific are repeatable. We tested the hypothesis that repeatability of testosterone levels within individuals underlies repeatable behaviors observed in our population. We measured nestling provisioning and aggressive nest defense against a heterospecific. After behavioral observations we captured either the male or female bluebird, and determined initial testosterone levels and maximum capacity of the gonads to secrete testosterone by injecting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We found among-individual variation in initial testosterone levels for males and females. Individual males were repeatable in both initial and GnRH-induced testosterone levels across behavioral contexts, while individual females were repeatable in GnRH-induced testosterone levels. However, testosterone levels were not significantly related to parental or nest defense behaviors, suggesting that repeatable testosterone levels may not drive repeatable parental and heterospecific nest defense behaviors in this population. The absence of a relationship between testosterone and parental and heterospecific nest defense behaviors might be due to among-individual variation in testosterone levels. Considering the sources of variation in testosterone levels may reveal why some populations exhibit high individual variation in hormone levels. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aggression; Challenge Hypothesis; Eastern bluebird; Gonadotropin-releasing hormone; Parental care; Repeatability","gonadorelin; testosterone; gonadorelin; testosterone; adult; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; behavior assessment; bird; blood sampling; breeding; controlled study; defensive behavior; female; hormone determination; hormone synthesis; male; nesting; nonhuman; parental behavior assessment; Phoenicurus ochruros; prenatal care; Sturnus vulgaris; testosterone blood level; aggression; animal; animal behavior; blood; comparative study; drug effects; metabolism; physiology; songbird; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Male; Nesting Behavior; Songbirds; Testosterone","Ambardar, M.; Department of Biological Sciences, Fort Hays State UniversityUnited States",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,"28322761","English","Gen.

We studied such within-litter differences in behavior in European rabbit pups Oryctolagus cuniculus prior to weaning, and whether and how these differences co-varied with other individual characteristics such as postnatal body temperature and early growth. The study was conducted under semi-natural conditions in a colony of rabbits of wild origin, where the young were born and developed in nursery burrows. We equipped two siblings per litter with interscapular skin temperature loggers on postnatal day 2 and recorded temperature profiles for 48 h. Individual body (skin) temperatures of pups within litters were repeatable across time, indicating the existence of consistent individual differences. Such differences within litters were associated with relative differences in pre-weaning growth, revealing that relatively warmer pups showed a greater increase in body mass during the nest period. Between postnatal days 12 and 17, after the pups had reached a developmental stage of greater mobility, we carried out different behavioral tests: a handling-restraint test, an open field test and a jump-down test from a platform. Individual responses in the former two tests were associated, as those pups showing a quicker struggling response to restraint during handling also exhibited greater exploratory activity in the open field. This correlation across contexts suggests the existence of personality types in wild rabbits at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, pups' behavioral responses were strongly associated with their relative within-litter body mass at testing. Animals with a lower body mass compared to their siblings showed a relatively quicker struggle response to handling restraint and covered a relatively larger distance in the open field, suggesting greater reactivity and responsiveness of relatively lighter pups in these tests. In contrast, relatively heavier pups jumped sooner from the platform, which may have been due to their greater physical maturation. In conclusion, our study shows that individual differences in behavior and associated differences in body temperature and growth are already present during early postnatal life, although such relationships can be easily overlooked, as they predominantly emerge as relative differences among littermates. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Body temperature; Early life conditions; Growth; Individual differences; Litter siblings; Personality","animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; behavior assessment; body mass; body temperature; developmental stage; individuality; juvenile animal; newborn; nonhuman; ontogeny; Oryctolagus cuniculus; personality assessment; priority journal; skin temperature; weaning; age; animal; exploratory behavior; growth, development and aging; litter size; motivation; motor activity; physiology; rabbits and hares; reaction time; statistics; Age Factors; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Behavior, Animal; Body Mass Index; Body Temperature; Exploratory Behavior; Handling (Psychology); Individuality; Litter Size; Motor Activity; Rabbits; Reaction Time; Statistics as Topic","Rödel, H.G.; Laboratoire d'Ethologie Expérimentale et Comparée E.A. 4443 (LEEC), Sorbonne Paris Cité, Université Paris 13, France; email: heiko.rodel@leec.univ-paris13.fr",,"Elsevier Inc.",00319384,,PHBHA,"28161326","English","Physiol.

To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon, enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4 behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h 2 B; behavior minus observer variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately heritable (0.17; h 2 B was low as it includes observer variance). This study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird. © The Author 2017.

The attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency) and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables measured in various tests with different contexts over several life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour is differentially consistent, the structure can change. © 2017 Simková et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"adolescent; adult; agonistic behavior; body size; breathing rate; ego development; female; foraging; heart; human; human experiment; juvenile; male; nonhuman; stress; subadult; theoretical model; velocity",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,,"English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019665374

The exploratory behavior is, therefore, often subjected to heterogenous selection. In populations of commensal rodents living in close proximity of humans, this pressure is further increased by pest management. We hypothesize that the black rat (Rattus rattus) responds to this pressure by either high behavioral flexibility or by development of personality types. The aim of this study was to analyze exploratory behavior and boldness of wild black rats and its changes over time to determine whether exploratory behavior is a personality trait in black rats. Studies on animals with unreduced variability are necessary for determination of normal range of behaviors. The behavior in the open field and hole board tests yielded 1 multivariate variable representing exploratory behavior and 1 representing boldness. The hole board test additionally provided an axis representing exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior showed moderate to high repeatability, even though we observed a considerable effect of habituation. Exploratory behavior was also strongly correlated across contexts; therefore, our results suggest that the black rat responds to heterogenous selection pressure by developing personality types. We also found a strong effect of litter identity on some aspects of the exploratory behavior. Boldness was less repeatable, which we interpret as high behavioral flexibility in this behavioral trait. In concordance with our hypothesis, the personality types in exploratory behavior, but not in boldness, are possibly maintained by heterogenous selection pressure created by human pest management. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Emotionality; Heterogenous selection; Hole board; Open field; Ship rat","animal; animal behavior; exploratory behavior; individuality; phenotype; rat; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Exploratory Behavior; Individuality; Phenotype; Rats","Frynta, D.; Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Viničná 7, Czech Republic; email: frynta@centrum.cz",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",07357036,,JCPPA,"28318291","English","J.

This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration. This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in which only part of a population migrates while the other remains resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species. Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S. selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus. The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between migratory and resident flies.

Recent experiences of winning or losing can also affect the chances of winning future contests, commonly referred to as ""winner-loser effects"". Individuals often differ in behavior in a consistent way, including in aggression, thereby showing differences in personality. However, the relative importance of recent experience and aspects of personality in determining rank, as well as the extent to which winning or losing affects aggression, has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate these questions using male domestic fowl. We matched males for body size, comb size, and aggression in pair-wise duels to: 1) study the effect of contest outcome on aggression and 2) compare the effect of individual aggression and contest experience on future social status in small groups. We found that aggression was a highly repeatable personality trait and that aggression increased after winning and decreased after losing. Nevertheless, such winner-loser effects were not enough to increase the odds of becoming dominant in a small group. Instead, aggressiveness measured prior to a contest experience best predicted future rank. Boldness and exploration did not predict rank and of the 2, only boldness was positively correlated with aggressiveness. We conclude that for male domestic fowl in contests among phenotypically matched contestants, aggressiveness is more important for obtaining high rank than winner-loser effects, or other aspects of personality. © The Author 2017.

Following that, results on heritability of personality are summarized. In addition, we reanalyzed all available behavioral genetic studies published before 2010, which were included in Vukasović and Bratko (2015) meta-analysis, to estimate the correlations between different family members: 1) monozygotic twins reared together; 2) monozygotic twins reared apart; 3) dizygotic twins reared together; 4) dizygotic twins reared apart; 5) mother and offspring; 6) father and offspring. Estimates of the family resemblance for personality were .54 from intraclass correlations for twin pairs reared together, .45 for intraclass correlations for monozygotic twin pairs reared apart, and .26 and .28 for familial aggregation. This finding is in line with the conclusion of the previous meta-analysis, which showed that the study design is a significant moderator of personality heritability, with twin studies showing higher estimates compared to family and adoption studies. Following that, findings from molecular genetic studies on personality and from gene-environment interaction studies are summarized.

However, the evolutionary role of particular within-species variance components (between-population, between- or within-individual variances) remains neglected. Here, we partition the variance in an anti-predator behaviour, flight initiation distance (FID), and assess how its within- and between-population variance are related to life history, distribution, dispersal and habitat ecology. Although the composition of within-species variance in FID depended on the phylogeny, most variance occurred within populations. When accounting for allometry, density-dependence, uncertainty in the phylogenetic hypothesis and heterogeneity in data quality, within-population variance was significantly associated with habitat diversity and population size. Between-population variance was a significant predictor of natal dispersal, senescence and habitat diversity. Accordingly, not only species-specific mean values of a behavioural trait, but also its variance within and among populations can shape the evolutionary ecology of species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","ecological plasticity; life history; mixed-models; pace of life syndromes; personality; repeatability; variation in behaviour","animal; bird; ecosystem; Europe; evolution; flying; genetics; phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Birds; Ecosystem; Europe; Flight, Animal; Phenotype; Phylogeny","Garamszegi, L.Z.; Department of Evolutionary Ecology, Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC, c/ Americo Vespucio, 26, Spain; email: laszlo.garamszegi@ebd.csic.es",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",1461023X,,ECLEF,"28349624","English","Ecol.

However, empirical studies about roles of behavioural individual variation in interspecific interactions are scarce. Here, we provide evidence that inter-individual variation of a cichlid in aggression affects access to its territory by a heterospecific cichlid. In Lake Tanganyika, a zoobenthivorous cichlid Neolamprologus mustax (Nm) is admitted into territories of an algivorous Variabilichromis moorii (Vm) to prey on benthic invertebrates, while other zoobenthivorous fishes are chased from the territories. We conducted an experiment in which caged Nm fish were exposed twice to each Vm fish in natural habitats. Results indicated repeatable individual variations in Vm aggression towards Nm. Moreover, diving observations indicated that Nm fish frequently used some of Vm territories inside their own territories, but rarely or never used others. This uneven use of Vm territories by the Nm fish was negatively correlated with individual variations in Vm aggression. We conclude that the preferential access of Nm to Vm territory is gained by Nm’s recognising more tolerant Vm fish or discriminating among sites for their territories. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aggression; Animal personality; Behavioural inter-individual variation; Cichlid; Interspecific interactions","aggression; behavioral response; empirical analysis; experimental study; individual variation; intraspecific interaction; perciform; territory; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika; Animalia; Cichlidae; Invertebrata; Neolamprologus; Pisces; Variabilichromis moorii","Ochi, H.4-4-7 Higashimon-cho, Japan; email: nyami2@arion.ocn.ne.jp",,"Springer International Publishing",00188158,,HYDRB,,"English","Hydrobiologia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969792941

We investigated the existence of consistent individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue for the study of animal personality in the wild. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","behavioural syndrome; captivity; fructosamine; novel object; physiological parameters; repeatability","behavioral response; biochemical composition; bioindicator; deer; environmental stress; experimental study; feeding behavior; hematology; physiological response; Animalia; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus","Monestier, C.; Department of Animal Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignUnited States; email: monestier.chloe@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Consistent differences between individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two broad aspects of individual females’ sociability, in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals’ states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed factors contributing to variation in individuals’ grouping patterns (to reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different conspecifics with which individuals associated (their ‘choosiness’ of social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were all related to females’ mean group sizes, and females with older dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more selective about group members when there was more food, and when they were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences exist among females in this population, and females’ measures of sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals’ states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females’ patterns of sociability over shorter periods. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","association patterns; behavioural plasticity; body condition; fission–fusion sociality; gregariousness; Macropus giganteus; personality; reproductive state","behavioral response; body condition; marsupial; rainfall; reproductive status; social behavior; wild population; Animalia; Macropodidae; Macropus giganteus","Goldizen, A.W.; School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia; email: bowerbirds@uq.edu.au",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Animal personality is characterized by repeatable and consistent between-individual behavioural differences throughout time and across different situations. Behavioural repeatability within life history stages and consistency between life history stages should be checked for the independence of sex and age, as recent data have shown that males and females in some species may differ in the repeatability of behavioural traits, as well as in their consistency. We measured the repeatability and consistency of three behavioural and one cognitive traits in juvenile and adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We found that exploration, activity and boldness were repeatable in juveniles and adults. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was only repeatable in adult mice. Exploration, activity and boldness were consistent before and after maturation, as well as before and after first sexual contact. Data on spatial recognition provided little evidence for consistency. Further, we found some evidence for a litter effect on behaviours by comparing different linear mixed models. We concluded that harvest mice express animal personality traits as behaviours were repeatable across sexes and consistent across life history stages. The tested cognitive trait showed low repeatability and was less consistent across life history stages. Given the rising interest in individual variation in cognitive performance, and in its relationship to animal personality, we suggest that it is important to gather more data on the repeatability and consistency of cognitive traits. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animal personality; Consistency; Eurasian harvest mouse; Micromysminutus; Repeatability; Spatial cognition","adult; cognition; evolutionary biology; individual variation; juvenile; life history; maturation; physiology; recognition; rodent; Animalia; Micromys minutus; Mus; Reithrodontomys; age; animal; animal behavior; Arvicolinae; cognition; female; male; personality; physiology; statistical model; Age Factors; Animals; Arvicolinae; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Female; Linear Models; Male; Personality","Schuster, A.C.; Department of Comparative Zoology, Institute for Evolution and Ecology, University of Tübingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 28, Germany; email: micromysminutus14@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",00281042,,,"28236075","English","Sci.

This study examined the test-retest reliability and validity of a frustration paradigm (the Affective Posner 2 task) and two irritability measures [the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) irritability]. Methods Participants were 109 youth from a general population sample of twins (aged 9–14 years). Participants completed two visits that were 2–4 weeks apart. At both visits, participants completed the Affective Posner 2 task and self-reported their irritability using the ARI. Parents reported their child's irritability using the ARI and completed the CBCL. Results The Affective Posner 2 task demonstrated good test-retest reliability, with intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranging from .44 to .78. The task effectively evoked negative affect (frustration and unhappiness) at both test and retest, demonstrating its construct validity. Moreover, self-rated frustration and unhappiness during the frustration components of the task correlated positively with self-reported but not parent-reported irritability, providing modest support for convergent validity. Parent- and child-reports of the ARI and parent-reports of the CBCL irritability measure showed excellent test-retest reliability, with ICCs ranging from .88 to .90. Limitations The sample consists of mostly twins aged 9–14 years from the communities. Thus, results may not generalize to non-twin samples or clinical samples outside of this age range. Conclusions The Affective Posner 2 paradigm and the ARI and CBCL irritability scales may be useful tools for longitudinal or treatment research on irritability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Frustration; Irritability; Parent-child agreement; Test-retest reliability; Validity","adolescent; Affective Posner 2 task; Affective Reactivity Index; Article; child; Child Behavior Checklist; construct validity; convergent validity; female; frustration; human; human experiment; individual behavior assessment; irritability; male; parent; priority journal; psychologic test; school child; self concept; self report; test retest reliability; twins; unhappiness; checklist; personality test; questionnaire; reproducibility; validation study; Adolescent; Checklist; Child; Female; Frustration; Humans; Irritable Mood; Male; Parents; Personality Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires","Tseng, W.-L.; Section on Bipolar Spectrum Disorders, Emotion and Development Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Building 15, Room 208, 15K North Drive, United States; email: wan-ling.tseng@nih.gov",,"Elsevier B.V.",01650327,,JADID,"28135689","English","J.

However, many personality traits likely have multiple effects on fitness, potentially operating across different functional contexts and stages of development. Here, we address the fitness consequences of boldness, under seminatural conditions, across life stages and functional contexts in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Specifically, we report the effect of boldness on (1) juvenile survivorship in an outdoor pond containing natural prey and predators and (2) adult reproductive success in three outdoor ponds across three reproductive seasons (years). Juvenile survival was negatively affected by boldness, with bolder juveniles having a lower probability of survival than shyer juveniles. In contrast, bolder adultmale bass had greater reproductive success than their shyermale counterparts. Female reproductive success was not affected by boldness. These findings demonstrate that boldness can affect fitness differently across life stages. Further, boldness was highly consistent across years and significantly heritable, which suggests that boldness has a genetic component.

Further, behavioural traits (personality traits) form behavioural syndromes, characterised by correlations between different behaviours. Mechanisms maintaining these correlations could be constrained due to underlying relationships with cognitive traits. There is growing evidence for the non-independence of animal personality and general cognitive abilities in animals, but so far, studies on the direction of the relationship between them revealed contradictory results. Still, it is hypothesised that individuals may exhibit consistent learning and decision styles. Fast behavioural types (consistently bolder and more active individuals) are expected to show faster learning styles. Slow behavioural types in contrast are assumed to learn slower but more accurately. This can be caused by a speed-accuracy trade-off that individuals face during decision making. We measured the repeatability of three personality and four spatial cognitive traits in adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We analysed correlations among personality traits (behavioural syndrome). We further investigated the relationships between personality and spatial cognitive traits as a first step exploring the potential connection between personality and cognition in this species. Results: Our results showed that exploration, activity and boldness were repeatable in adult mice. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was also significantly repeatable, as well as spatial learning performance and decision speed. We found no repeatability of decision accuracy. Harvest mice showed a behavioural syndrome as we observed strong positive correlations between personality traits. The speed-accuracy trade-off was not apparent within, nor between individuals. Nevertheless, we found weak evidence for a relationship between personality and spatial cognitive traits as fast behavioural types learned a spatial orientation task faster than slow types, and shyer harvest mice made decisions quicker than bolder mice. Conclusions: Given these correlations, our data provided some first insights into the relationship between personality and spatial cognitive traits in harvest mice and will hopefully stimulate more studies in this field. © 2017 The Author(s).","Animal personality; Cognitive styles; Eurasian harvest mouse; Micromys minutus; Spatial learning; Speed-accuracy trade-off",,"Schuster, A.C.; University of Tübingen, Department of Comparative Zoology, Institute for Evolution and Ecology, Auf der Morgenstelle 28, Germany; email: micromysminutus14@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17429994,,,,"English","Front.

However, it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i) for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability estimates because these two indices carry different information. We discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies, including meta-analyses. A lay summary is available for this article. © 2016 The Authors.

Using a 19-year study on Montagu′s harrier, we report a long-term increase in boldness towards humans during nest visits. The probability of females fleeing or being passive during nest visits decreased, while defence intensity steadily increased over the study period. These behavioural responses towards humans were significantly repeatable. The phenotypic composition of the breeding population changed throughout the study period (4–5 harrier generations), with a gradual disappearance of shy individuals, leading to a greater proportion of bolder ones and a more behaviourally homogeneous population. We further show that nest visit frequency increased nest failure probability and reduced productivity of shy females, but not of bold ones.

Heart rate (HR) (beats per minute (BPM)) is associated with feed efficiency and influenced by autonomic activity and peripheral metabolism, suggesting HR could be used as a proxy for feed efficiency. Objectives were to assess associations between overnight HR, lying patterns and RFI, and between acute stress HR and RFI. Heifer calves (n=107; 408±28 days of age, 341±42.2 kg) and yearling heifers (n=36; 604±92 days of age, 539±52.2 kg) were exposed to a performance test to determine productive performance. Overnight HR (electrode based) and lying patterns (accelerometer based) were monitored on a subgroup of heifer calves (n=40; 20 lowest RFI; 20 highest RFI). In the 10-min acute stress assessment, all heifers were individually exposed to the opening and closing of an umbrella and HR before (HRBEF), in response to (HRMAX), after (HRAFT) and change (HRCHG; HRAFT-HRBEF) as a result of exposure were determined. Using polynomial regression, rate of HR decrease pre-exposure (β1) and rates of HR increase (β2) and decrease (β3, β4) post-exposure were determined. Heifer calves in the overnight assessment were classified into equal RFI groups (low RFI; high RFI) and HR means were treated as repeated measures and compared using multiple regression. In the acute stress assessment, heifers were classified within cattle category into equal RFI groups (low RFI; high RFI) and means and polynomial regression parameters were compared using multiple regression. Low-RFI heifer calves had a lower overnight HR (69.2 v. 72.6 BPM), similar HR change from lying to standing intervals (8.9 v. 9.2 BPM) and similar time lying (61.1% v. 64.5%) compared with high-RFI heifer calves. Low-RFI heifer calves had a higher absolute HRMAX (162.9 v. 145.7 BPM) and β2 (-0.34 v. -0.20) than high-RFI heifer calves. Low-RFI yearling heifers had similar acute stress HR means and a lower β1 (0.003 v. 0.006) than high-RFI yearling heifers. Overnight HR and acute stress HR are potential indicators of RFI in heifer calves. However, acute stress HR results varied in yearling heifers, suggesting previous handling experience and/or age influence stress response. Pending further development (predictive ability, repeatability), the acute stress assessment could have potential for on-farm application as a feed efficiency proxy in young heifers with minimal handling experience. © The Animal Consortium 2016.","biomarker; bovine behaviour; cardiovascular function; coping style; residual feed intake","animal; animal food; bovine; coping behavior; eating; female; heart rate; physiological stress; physiology; weight gain; Adaptation, Psychological; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Eating; Female; Heart Rate; Stress, Physiological; Weight Gain",,,"Cambridge University Press",17517311,,,"27514832","English","Animal",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982144546

This study aimed to examine the reliability and the validity of this instrument. Methods: French- and English-speaking adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (N = 447) were recruited from schools and clinical settings in Montreal and were evaluated twice. The internal consistency was estimated by Cronbach alpha coefficients and the test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficients. Cutoff points on the DIA-R scales were determined by using clinically relevant measures for defining external validation criteria: the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Abbreviated-Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses provided accuracy estimates (area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio) to evaluate the ability of the DIA-R scales to predict external criteria. Results: For most of the DIA-R scales, reliability coefficients were excellent or moderate. High or moderate accuracy estimates from ROC analyses demonstrated the ability of the DIA-R thresholds to predict psychopathological conditions. These thresholds were generally capable to discriminate between clinical and school subsamples. However, the validity of the obsessions/compulsions scale was too low. Conclusions: Findings clearly support the reliability and the validity of the DIA-R. This instrument may be useful to assess a wide range of adolescents' mental health problems in the continuum of services. This conclusion applies to all scales, except the obsessions/compulsions one. © Canadian Psychiatric Association.","borderline traits; Dominic Interactive for Adolescents-Revised; DSM-5; mental disorders; reliability; self-report screen; suicidality; validity","Abbreviated Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines; adolescent; Article; attention deficit disorder; Beck Hopelessness Scale; borderline state; child; child psychiatry; controlled study; correlation coefficient; criterion related validity; Cronbach alpha coefficient; disease classification; Dominic Interactive for Adolescents Revised; drug dependence; DSM-5; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental disease; mental disease assessment; mental health; obsessive compulsive disorder; oppositional defiant disorder; predictive validity; psychiatric diagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia; screening test; self report; sensitivity and specificity; social phobia; suicidal behavior; test retest reliability; borderline state; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; mental disease; psychological rating scale; reproducibility; standards; suicide; Adolescent; Borderline Personality Disorder; Child; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Suicide; User-Computer Interface","Bergeron, L.; Research Centre, CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, Rivière-des-Prairies Hospital, 7070 Perras Boulevard, Canada; email: lise.bergeron.hrdp@ssss.gouv.qc.ca",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",07067437,,CJPSD,"27638424","English","Can.

There is growing evidence that individuals can differ both in average expression and level of plasticity in this type of character. Both of these aspects are studied in conjunction within a reaction norm framework. Theoreticians have investigated the factors promoting variation in reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes (level of plasticity) of a key labile character: behaviour. A general prediction from their work is that selection will favour the evolution of repeatable individual variation in level of plasticity only under certain ecological conditions. While factors promoting individual repeatability of plasticity have thus been identified, empirical estimates of this phenomenon are largely lacking for wild populations. We assayed aggressiveness of individual male great tits (Parus major) twice during their egg-laying stage and twice during their egg-incubation stage to quantify each male's level of seasonal plasticity. This procedure was applied during six consecutive years; all males breeding in our plots during those years were assayed, resulting in repeated measures of individual reaction norms for any individual breeding in multiple years. We quantified among- and within-individual variation in reaction norm components, allowing us to estimate repeatability of seasonal plasticity. Using social pedigree information, we further partitioned reaction norm components into their additive genetic and permanent environmental counterparts. Cross-year individual repeatability for the intercepts (average aggressiveness) and slopes (level of seasonal plasticity) of the aggressiveness reaction norms were 0·574 and 0·516 respectively. The mean of the posterior distributions suggested modest heritabilities (h2 = 0·260 for intercepts; h2 = 0·266 for slopes), but these estimates were relatively uncertain. Males behaved more aggressively in areas with higher breeding densities, and became less aggressive and less plastic with increasing age; plasticity thus varied within individuals and was multidimensional in nature. This empirical study quantified cross-year individual repeatability, heritability and age-related reversible plasticity in behaviour. Acknowledging such patterns of multi-level variation is important not only for testing behavioural ecology theory concerning the evolution of repeatable differences in behavioural plasticity but also for predicting how reversible plasticity may evolve in natural populations. © 2016 The Authors.

Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain between-individual variation in risk-taking behaviour in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within- and between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day. We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall, time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour, but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect immediate risk-taking decisions. Significance statement: We investigated the proximate determinants of escape ability in collared flycatcher males and whether this trait can be a potential driver of risk-taking behaviour, which is a rarely considered issue. We measured escape ability as time needed to capture birds in an outdoor aviary by hand. We found that escape ability was repeatable only in a short-term context, and differed between the courtship and chick-feeding periods, probably due to parallel changes in body condition. Furthermore, escape ability in yearlings (but not in adults) correlated with an estimate of risk-taking in the wild indicating that males with better ability to escape take higher risk. Our findings highlight that individual decisions about risk-taking might partially rely on how individuals assess their potential escape success. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Antipredator behaviour; Passerine; Personality; Plasticity; Predation avoidance; Repeatability","antipredator defense; avoidance reaction; body condition; body mass; courtship; escape behavior; fitness; flight behavior; nestling; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; Animalia; Aves; Ficedula albicollis; Passeriformes","Jablonszky, M.; Behavioural Ecology Group, Department of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, Eötvös Loránd University, Pázmány P. sétány 1/C, Hungary; email: jablonszky.monika@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

As charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at distances of ≤3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified two distinct turtle personality types, ‘bold’ and ‘timid’, based upon 145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further, turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of turtles. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ecotourism; Flight initiation distance; Personality; Principal component analysis; Repeatability","behavioral response; bioactivity; ecotourism; environmental disturbance; flight activity; human activity; principal component analysis; scuba diving; turtle; wild population; Animalia; Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Chondrichthyes; Testudines; animal; diving; human; predation; shark; turtle; Animals; Diving; Humans; Predatory Behavior; Sharks; Turtles","Griffin, L.P.; Department of Environmental Conservation and Intercampus Marine Science Graduate Program, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 160 Holdsworth Way, United States; email: lpgriffin@eco.umass.edu",,"Springer Verlag",00298549,,OECOB,"28039527","English","Oecologia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007508037

Increased encounters should in turn drive vulnerability to capture by passively operated gears. However, empirical evidence documenting a relationship between activity-based behaviours and vulnerability to capture by passive fishing gear in the wild is limited. Using whole-lake acoustic telemetry, we first documented significant repeatabilities over several months in a suite of encounter rate-associated behaviours (swimming distance, activity space size, time on baited feeding sites, switching frequency among baited feeding sites, distance to the lake bottom) in two recreationally important benthivorous cyprinid species, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tench (Tinca tinca). We then experimentally targeted both species using stationary angling on baited feeding sites. Individual fish regularly visited the angling sites, documenting that the fishes encountered the angling baits. When attempting to explain individual variation in vulnerability as a function of repeatable behavioural traits, we found no evidence of a significant relationship among various encounter-based behaviours and vulnerability to angling for both species. There was also no evidence for size selection or for energetically less conditioned fish to be more vulnerable. The data cumulatively suggest that fine-scale behaviours after encountering a bait (e.g., frequency of bait intake) may be ultimately decisive for determining vulnerability to angling in benthivorous fish. Based on our work, fishinginduced selection on encounter-based behaviours in recreational angling for benthivorous fish in the wild appears unlikely. © 2017 Monk, Arlinghaus.

Here, we have repeatedly measured three circadian behaviours, awakening time, rest onset and rest duration, in the free-ranging pearly razorfish, Xyrithchys novacula, facilitated by acoustic tracking technology and hidden Markov models. In addition, daily travelled distance, a standard measure of daily activity as fish personality trait, was repeatedly assessed using a State-Space Model. We have decomposed the variance of these four behavioural traits using linear mixed models and estimated repeatability scores (R) while controlling for environmental co-variates: year of experimentation, spatial location of the activity, fish size and gender and their interactions. Betweenand within-individual variance decomposition revealed significant Rs in all traits suggesting high predictability of individual circadian behavioural variation and the existence of chronotypes. The decomposition of the correlations among chronotypes and the personality trait studied here into between- and within-individual correlations did not reveal any significant correlation at between-individual level.

Despite its increasing use in basic and clinical research, surprisingly little is known about the test-retest reliability of spectral power and peak frequency measures of beta oscillatory signals from sensorimotor cortex. Establishing that these beta measures are stable over time in healthy populations is a necessary precursor to their use in the clinic. Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate intra-individual reliability of beta-band oscillations over six sessions, focusing on changes in beta activity during movement (Movement-Related Beta Desynchronization, MRBD) and after movement termination (Post-Movement Beta Rebound, PMBR). Subjects performed visually-cued unimanual wrist flexion and extension. We assessed Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and between-session correlations for spectral power and peak frequency measures of movement-related and resting beta activity. Movement-related and resting beta power from both sensorimotor cortices was highly reliable across sessions. Resting beta power yielded highest reliability (average ICC=0.903), followed by MRBD (average ICC=0.886) and PMBR (average ICC=0.663). Notably, peak frequency measures yielded lower ICC values compared to the assessment of spectral power, particularly for movement-related beta activity (ICC=0.386–0.402). Our data highlight that power measures of movement-related beta oscillations are highly reliable, while corresponding peak frequency measures show greater intra-individual variability across sessions. Importantly, our finding that beta power estimates show high intra-individual reliability over time serves to validate the notion that these measures reflect meaningful individual differences that can be utilised in basic research and clinical studies. © 2016 The Authors","Beta oscillations; EEG; Intraclass correlation coefficient; Sensorimotor cortex; Test-retest reliability","adult; Article; behavior assessment; beta rhythm; controlled study; electroencephalography; female; human; human experiment; intraindividual reliability; male; movement related beta desynchronization; movement related beta oscillation; nervous system parameters; oscillation; peak frequency; post movement beta rebound; priority journal; reliability; sensorimotor cortex; spectral power; association; biomechanics; electroencephalography; electroencephalography phase synchronization; innervation; movement (physiology); photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; reproducibility; somatosensory cortex; wrist; young adult; Adult; Beta Rhythm; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cues; Electroencephalography; Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization; Female; Humans; Male; Movement; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Somatosensory Cortex; Wrist; Young Adult","Espenhahn, S.; Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London, 33 Queen Square, United Kingdom; email: Svenja.Espenhahn.13@ucl.ac.uk",,"Academic Press Inc.",10538119,,NEIME,"27965146","English","NeuroImage",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006248461

We therefore investigated the effect of elevated PCO2 and temperature on locomotion and behaviour during prey searching in the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, a predator characteristic of the southeastern Pacific coast. Movement duration, decision time, route finding and lateralization were measured using a T-maze tank with a prey positioned behind a barrier. Four treatments, representing present day and near-future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming were usedin rearing the individuals for 6 months. Regardless of the treatment, no significant differences were found in relative and absolute lateralization before and after exposure for 6 months. However, relative lateralization was not repeatable for animals tested after 6 months at elevated PCO2 at both experimental temperatures, whereas it was repeatable in individuals kept at the present day level of PCO2. We suggest that these effects may be related to a behavioural malfunction caused by elevated PCO2. Movement duration, decision time and route finding were not repeatable. However, movement duration and decision time increased and route finding decreased in elevated PCO2 (at 15°C), suggesting that elevated PCO2 has negative effects on the locomotor and sensory performance of C. concholepas in the presence of aprey odour, thereby decreasing their ability to forage efficiently. © 2017.

Currently prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration is the most used prostate cancer marker, but it only shows limited specificity. Because PSA glycosylation is altered by prostate cancer, detecting glycosylation changes could increase PSA specificity as a prostate cancer marker. Changes in PSA glycosylation can modify its electrophoretic- behavior and techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) could be applied to detect changes in PSA glycosylation. Most serum PSA is complexed with alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT). To have access to most of the PSA, the complexed PSA has to be released as free PSA (fPSA); in addition, this total fPSA must be purified from the serum matrix so that it can be analyzed using CZE. In this work a methodology for isolating PSA from serum for its CZE analysis was established. By using PSA standard, the effect of this methodology, which combines conditions for dissociating complexed PSA and immunoaffinity chromatographic purification, was studied. It was seen that this highly repeatable sample treatment did not noticeably alter the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum or the CZE pattern of PSA standard. Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the developed sample treatment was applied to serum from a cancer patient with a high PSA content. The following observations can be made from these experiments: first of all, the 2-DE pattern of serum PSA remained unchanged after sample treatment; second, as hypothesized, the established sample preparation methodology made it possible to obtain the CZE pattern of PSA from serum; and third, the CZE pattern of serum PSA and of PSA standard from seminal plasma of healthy individuals, both submitted to the sample treatment method, showed some differences regarding the proportion of CZE peaks of the glycoprotein. These differences could be related to possible changes in the linkages of peptide backbone, in glycosylation or in other post-translational modifications between samples from both origins. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Capillary electrophoresis; Prostate cancer biomarker; Prostate specific antigen; Sample treatment; Serum; Two-dimensional electrophoresis","alpha 1 antichymotrypsin; alpha 2 macroglobulin; ethanolamine; prostate specific antigen; biological marker; isoprotein; prostate specific antigen; alkalinity; antibody affinity; Article; cancer patient; capillary zone electrophoresis; circular dichroism; human; male; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein blood level; protein glycosylation; seminal plasma; two dimensional electrophoresis; Western blotting; blood; capillary electrophoresis; procedures; Prostatic Neoplasms; two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; Biomarkers; Electrophoresis, Capillary; Humans; Male; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Isoforms; Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis","Peracaula, R.; Faculty of Sciences, University of GironaSpain; email: rosa.peracaula@udg.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",07317085,,JPBAD,"27918991","English","J.

Here, we show individual differences in the swimming behavior of Daphnia magna, a clonal freshwater invertebrate, before, during, and after being exposed to a lethal threat, ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We show consistency in swimming velocity among both mothers and daughters of D. magna in a neutral environment, whereas this pattern breaks down when exposed to UVR. Our study also, for the first time, illustrates how the ontogenetic development in swimming and refuge-seeking behavior of young individuals eventually approaches that of adults. Overall, we show that aquatic invertebrates are far from being identical robots, but instead they show considerable individual differences in behavior that can be attributed to both ontogenetic development and individual consistency. Our study also demonstrates, for the first time, that behavioral consistency and repeatability, that is, something resembling ""personality,"" is context and state dependent in this zooplankter taxa. © 2017 Heuschele et al.","Animal personality; Behavioral type; Daphnia; UV radiation; Zooplankton",,,,"Ecological Society of America",21508925,,,,"English","Ecosphere",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014044290

Among these impacts is exposure to anthropogenic contaminants. Any environmental variable that influences internal state could impact behaviour across a number of levels: at the sample mean, at the level of among-individual differences in behaviour (‘animal personality’) and at the level of within-individual variation in behaviour (intra-individual variation, ‘IIV’). Here we examined the effect of exposure to seawater-borne copper on the startle response behaviour of European hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus across these levels. Copper exposure rapidly led to longer startle responses on average, but did not lead to any change in repeatability indicating that individual differences were present and equally consistent in the presence and absence of copper. There was no strong evidence that copper exposure led to changes in IIV. Our data show that exposure to copper for 1 week produces sample mean level changes in the behaviour of hermit crabs. However, there is no evidence that this exposure led to changes in repeatability through feedback loops. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Feedback; Pollution; Reaction-norm; Startle-response","anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; behavioral response; climate feedback; copper; crab; individual variation; pollution; pollution exposure; reaction norm; seawater; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Pagurus bernhardus; copper; animal; animal behavior; Anomura; personality; startle reflex; Animals; Anomura; Behavior, Animal; Copper; Personality; Reflex, Startle","Briffa, M.; Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre, Plymouth University, Drake Circus, United Kingdom; email: mark.briffa@plymouth.ac.uk",,"Springer Verlag",00298549,,OECOB,"27896477","English","Oecologia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997684083

While fitness relates to the performance of animals in the wild, most of the research on evolutionary potential of behavioural traits has used captive or mesocosm settings, especially with aquatic organisms. We investigated the individual level consistency (personalities) and correlations (behavioural syndromes) of fitness-related behavioural traits displayed by a harvested marine fish in the natural environment, and the potential of such individual level behaviour to constrain adaptive evolution. For this, we acoustically tracked 303 individuals of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, over a period of 3 years from two populations in southern Norway. We then estimated repeatability and correlations between four behavioural traits: diel vertical migration, activity, home range and dispersal. Average autonomy was estimated as a measure of the potential of the observed behavioural syndromes to constrain evolution. We found a moderate to high individual consistency in all behavioural traits (mean repeatability 0.41, range 0.22–0.66) suggesting that they reflect fish personalities. Also, behavioural traits were structured into behavioural syndromes, where one population displayed a more integrated behavioural syndrome (all the four traits correlated) than the other (only home range and dispersal correlated). In both populations, the magnitude of these behavioural syndromes could potentially constrain evolution, as revealed by average autonomy values significantly below 1. Our study provides strong empirical support to the idea that natural and human-induced selection on behavioural traits can indeed drive adaptive evolution, and, further, that such evolutionary responses may be constrained by the correlational structure among multiple traits. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","adaptive evolution; Atlantic cod; behaviour; behavioural syndrome; repeatability","activity pattern; aquatic organism; behavioral response; biotelemetry; correlation; dispersal; evolution; evolutionary biology; fish; fitness; gadoid; home range; individual variation; marine environment; migratory behavior; Norway; Animalia; Gadus morhua","Villegas-Ríos, D.; Institute of Marine Research, Nye Flødevigveien 20, Norway",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

In songbirds, a number of singing behaviors have been proposed to be aggressive signals used in territory defense, including song rate. Although aggressive signaling in songbirds has received considerable research attention, adequate evidence for most putative aggressive signals is not available. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether the song rate of male wood warblers Phylloscopus sibilatrix is a signal of their aggressive intent in male–male interactions. We found that males responded differentially to simulated territorial intrusions depending on the song rate of an intruder. Moreover, males that continued to sing during territorial contests increased their song rates, and this behavior predicted the strength of aggressive escalation by the signaler. These results suggest that song rate is an aggressive signal during male–male interactions in the wood warbler. We also found high intra-individual repeatability in the strength of aggressive response to simulated intrusions, likely reflecting differences in personality (aggressiveness) or quality of male wood warblers. We conclude that changes in singing rate may be an efficient mechanism of signaling immediate shifts in motivation of signalers during territorial contests, especially in species that lack large repertoires or have simple songs. © 2016 The Authors",,"aggression; defense mechanism; interspecific interaction; passerine; signaling; song; territoriality; Animalia; Phylloscopus sibilatrix",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09088857,,JAVBE,,"English","J.

While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour (thereby causing among-individual variation or 'personality') and within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual variance or 'stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the expression of these variance components were sex-specific. Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein. We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood. Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males, and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in female body weight. Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual variance (i.e., individual variation in 'behavioural stability') and individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., 'personality'), though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such as behaviour and body weight. © 2017 The Author(s).","Behavioural stability; Developmental plasticity; Diet; Heterogeneous residual within-individual variance; Personality; Repeatability","adult; behavioral ecology; body condition; conspecific; cricket; diet; environmental factor; individual variation; juvenile; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; sex-related difference; Gryllinae; Gryllus bimaculatus; carbohydrate diet; protein intake; aggression; animal; animal behavior; body composition; body weight; carbohydrate diet; diet; drug effects; feeding behavior; female; Gryllidae; male; personality; pharmacology; phenotype; physiology; protein intake; sexual behavior; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Composition; Body Weight; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Proteins; Feeding Behavior; Female; Gryllidae; Male; Personality; Phenotype; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Han, C.S.; Behavioural Ecology, Department of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Großhaderner Str. 2, Germany; email: hcspol@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712148,,,"28073352","English","BMC Evol.

Additionally, when multiple endangered species interact, those relationships must also be considered when exploring recovery plans for either or both species. In our continued efforts to conserve the critically endangered Leon Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon bovinus), we explored consistency in aggression toward the endangered sympatric Pecos gambusia (Gambusia nobilis), that attempt to prey upon pupfish eggs during spawnings. We repeatedly observed 13 territorial male pupfish and measured individual aggression, focusing on defensive chases against gambusia and interactions with other pupfish. Short-distance chases at gambusia and chases of territorial neighbors were significantly repeatable, indicating that pupfish show behavioral consistency, or “personality”. Moreover, male pupfish that gave more short chases to gambusia experienced higher spawning success. Together, these data suggest that personality can predict reproductive success and thus should be considered by managers working to conserve endangered populations. Conservationists should take into consideration that differential reproductive success may certainly be relevant to the recovery of at-risk species. © 2015 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","behavioral syndromes; Cyprinodon bovinus; gambusia; Gambusia nobilis; personality; pupfish; recovery plans","aggression; behavioral ecology; conservation management; conservation planning; conservation status; cyprinid; endangered species; life history; reproductive success; Cyprinodon bovinus; Gambusia; Gambusia nobilis","Snekser, J.L.; Biology Department, LIU Post, 720 Northern Blvd, United States; email: jennifer.snekser@liu.edu",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",03949370,,EEEVE,,"English","Ethol.

Key in this regard is the, often untested, assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for significant between-individual correlations between the investigated traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have important implications for the social organization within complex social environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant processes. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","(co)variance partitioning; animal personality; behavioural syndrome; long term; seasonal context; social behaviour; Sturnus vulgaris","fitness; life history; life history trait; passerine; seasonal variation; selection; social organization; Animalia; Aves; Sturnidae; Sturnus vulgaris","Thys, B.; Campus Drie Eiken, Building D–Room 1.23, Universiteitsplein 1, Belgium; email: bert.thys@uantwerpen.be",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to reveal linkages or trade − offs. In animals, these validations have widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The animals did not learn to “always choose the larger item” in the cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual differences. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cavia aperea f. porcellus; Cognition; Personality; Repeatability; Stability over time; Transposition","behavioral response; cognition; learning; life history; psychology; rodent; trade-off; aggression; animal experiment; Cavia aperea; learning; life history; nonhuman; personality; species; stimulus; velocity; animal; animal behavior; cognition; guinea pig; learning; personality; physiology; psychology; Animalia; Cavia; Cavia aperea; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Guinea Pigs; Learning; Personality","Guenther, A.; Department of Animal Behaviour, Bielefeld University, Morgenbreede 45, Germany; email: anja.guenther@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"27363384","English","Behav.

We investigated how nutritional status during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development, throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3 weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the 2. However, repeatability (τ) in response to cues of predator presence was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our results demonstrate that subtle differences in the quality of the environment experienced early in life can influence how individuals negotiate behavioral and life-history trade-offs later in life. © The Author 2016.","activity; animal personality; antipredator response; behavioral syndromes; behavioral variation; developmental conditions; diet quality; house crickets; permanent environment","activity pattern; antipredator defense; behavioral response; biological development; body size; diet; environmental cue; growth rate; nutritional status; Acheta domesticus; Animalia; Gryllidae","Royauté, R.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State University, 1340 Bolley Drive, 201 Stevens Hall, United States; email: raphael.royaute@gmail.com",,"Oxford University Press",10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Exploration may influence learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality. Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90° (vertical, the S+) and 135° (the S−). After training pigeons underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the direction towards the S−. These results suggest that birds with different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned information. Further testing is needed to confirm which cue(s) (S+ or S−) control the behaviour of fast-explorers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Animal personality; Cognition; Exploratory behaviour; Generalization; Individual differences; Pigeon","behavioral ecology; bird; cognition; exploration; individual variation; performance assessment; training; cognition; controlled study; exploratory behavior; human; human experiment; nonhuman; personality; pigeon; species; stimulus; animal; animal behavior; exploratory behavior; learning; personality; physiology; pigeons and doves; Animalia; Aves; Columba; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Columbidae; Exploratory Behavior; Learning; Personality","Guillette, L.M.; School of Biology, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom; email: lmg4@st-andrews.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"27567525","English","Behav.

Although interest for a link between personality and cognition is growing, no study to date investigated whether a cognitive bias might be related to the personality of the individuals. We trained 43 domestic canaries (Serinus canaria) to discriminate between two sides of a test cage, each side being associated with a different value (attractive or aversive food in a dish). During the test phase, the dish was placed at intermediate locations, representing ambiguous information. Results show evidence of an “optimistic” bias (flying faster to the dish at the ambiguous location) in birds housed in pairs, compared to birds housed singly, suggesting an influence of social context (living conditions) on canaries’ emotions when tested individually. We also studied six traits of individuals’ personality and found that aggressiveness, neophobia, one sociability index and obstinacy were repeatable across social context and/or day-light schedule, whereas the other sociability index, boldness and locomotion were not. No correlation between the birds’ optimism and any of their personality traits was found, suggesting that cognitive bias may be a matter of social context rather than of individual personality. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Animal welfare; Cognitive bias; Emotions; Individual differences; Personality; Serinus canaria; Social enrichment","aggression; animal welfare; behavioral ecology; cognition; domestic species; individual variation; locomotion; pair bond; passerine; social behavior; training; aggressiveness; animal behavior; animal experiment; boldness; cognitive bias; controlled study; decision making; discrimination learning; emotional attachment; exploratory behavior; female; high risk behavior; latent period; male; mate choice; neophobia; nonhuman; obstinacy; personality; pessimism; Review; Serinus; Serinus canaria; sociability; social environment; social status; animal; animal housing; cognition; personality; physiology; Serinus; Animalia; Aves; Serinus canaria; Animals; Canaries; Cognition; Female; Housing, Animal; Male; Personality","Bovet, D.; Laboratoire Ethologie Cognition Développement, Université Nanterre Paris Ouest La DéfenseFrance; email: dbovet@u-paris10.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"27697598","English","Behav.

Flight initiation distance (FID) is often studied in the context of island tameness; however, little is known about the factors that influence and maintain FID variation in predation-free populations. Here, we studied FID in foals of an isolated predator-free population of feral horses (Equus caballus L., 1758) on Sable Island, Canada, to determine if FID could be used for research on consistent individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days). Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex effects. In contrast, FID decreased for measurements made on subsequent days and from east to west, which could reflect habituation to human presence and (or) other temporal and spatial processes. Repeatability was high (0.42 ± 0.06), but tended to decrease with increasing time intervals. This study highlights the potential of FID for individual-based research on the ecology and evolutionary dynamics of risk aversion in predation-free populations. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

This would be problematic if particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate, skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions, with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific, predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions, yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition. Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or females. While participation among males in high body condition was consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females, regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later, rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex, body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual differences in cognition difficult to interpret. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive test battery; Motivation; Participation; Personality; Pheasant","behavioral response; bird; body condition; captive population; cognition; habituation; individual variation; local participation; sampling; sex-related difference; testing method; wild population; animal experiment; body constitution; chick; controlled study; female; habituation; male; motivation; nonhuman; personality; pheasant; reward; sampling bias; animal; animal behavior; cognition; Galliformes; individuality; personality; physiology; sex difference; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Female; Galliformes; Individuality; Male; Personality; Sex Factors","van Horik, J.O.; Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, Washington Singer Laboratories, Psychology, University of Exeter, College of Life and Environmental SciencesUnited Kingdom; email: j.van-horik@exeter.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"27397575","English","Behav.

CIDs in phenotypic traits are maintained over time, and can be measured by repeatability at different times. We used juvenile Chinese bream (Pa ra b ramis p ekin en sis) as an animal model to determine individual variation and correlation between energy metabolism and personality behaviors of cyprinid fish. Under conditions of (25 ± 0.5)°C, the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR, induced by exhaustive exercise), and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) of fish were determined, and the metabolic scope (MS) and factorial metabolic scope (FAS) were also calculated. Personality behaviors, including boldness (indicated by latncy), activity (indicated by distance moved, average swimming velocity, and percent time spent moving) were measured for individuals (trial I). All of the aforementioned phenotypic traits were measured again after one month (trial H). The results showed that both body mass and body length of juvenile Chinese bream increased substantially, and these two morphological parameters showed good repeatability during the experiment (both P < 0.05). Only the SMR of fish was repeatable, and not MMR, MS, FAS, and EPOC. SMR was negatively correlated with MS, FAS, and EPOC (all P < 0.0 5), and showed no correlation with MMR. MS had a positive correlation with both FAS and MMR (both P < 0.0 5). The direction of some correlations between components of energy metabolism of the juvenile Chinese bream did not change during the course of experiment. Boldness (indicated as laten cy) of the experimental fish did not exhibit repeatability, and was significantly higher in trial H than in trial I (P <0.05). The latencies of the two measurements were not correlated with SMR. In addition, distance moved, swimming velocity, and percent time spent moving were also not repeatable. However, the relationships among these three activity parameters were all positive in spite of the effects of time. When compared to those of trial I, the values of the three parameters of activity all increased in trial H. SMR in the two trials were positively related to the specific growth rate (SCR) in this fish species during the course of experiment. The present study suggests there were nonparallel changes in tendency and repeatability between the energy metabolism and personality behaviors of juvenile Chinese bream under artificial rearing conditions where environmental parameters were spatially and temporally predictable. Some correlations existed between the phenotypic traits and were substantially affected, to different extents, by environmental conditions. SMR of juvenile Chinese bream may predict their growth trajectory during their juvenile stage. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Conditions in the field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions, and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including repeatability and its between- and within-individual variance components. Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those that transitioned from field to laboratory.

These trait complexes, known as syndromes, can have dramatic evolutionary consequences as they do not evolve independently but rather as a unit. Current research focuses primarily on syndromes relating to aspects of behavior and life history. What is less clear is whether physiological traits also form a syndrome. We measured 10 thermal traits in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to test this idea. Repeatability was calculated and their across-context correlations evaluated. Our results were in alignment with our predictions in that individual thermal traits varied consistently and were structured into a physiological syndrome, which we are referring to as the thermal behavior syndrome (TBS). Within this syndrome, lizards exhibited a “thermal type” with each being ranked along a cold–hot continuum. Hot types had faster sprint speeds and higher preferred body temperatures, whereas the opposite was true for cold types. We conclude that physiological traits may evolve as a single unit driven by the need to maintain optimal temperatures that enable fitness-related behaviors to be maximized. � 2016 The Authors.

However, little is known about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity. We conclude that in our study population, the classic exploration behaviour test seems context specific, rather than constituting a general exploration strategy. © 2016 The Authors","activity; animal personality; context validation; cross-context consistency; exploration behaviour; novel environment","activity pattern; behavioral ecology; environmental conditions; exploration; habitat corridor; laboratory method; life history trait; light effect; model validation; passerine; wild population; Animalia; Parus major","Arvidsson, L.K.; Groenenborgercampus, G.V. 330, Groenenborgerlaan 171, Belgium",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles. Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic female resistance. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","Gerris; hiding; personality; pre-copulatory struggle; sex-ratio; sexual conflict","female; fitness; insect; male; mating behavior; phenotype; sex ratio; sexual conflict; Gerridae; Gerris; Gerris buenoi","Pineaux, M.; Département de Biologie, Université LavalCanada; email: m.pineaux@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85004140737

Boldness was repeatable across three novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections predicted approach of this item. Age–sex class differences in boldness and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder than adult females and had higher snake inspection counts. These age–sex differences fit well with expected variation in risk–reward ratios of exploratory risk-taking behaviour considered within a life history framework for this species.

Behaviors elicited by novel-object tests were defined by a component related to caution around novel-objects (Ob-PC1) and behaviors elicited by novel food-tests were defined by correlated components related to consummatory responses (Fo-PC1) and caution around novel foods (Fo-PC2). The repeatability of Ob-PC1 was modest and not significant; the repeatabilities of Fo-PC1 and Fo-PC2 were moderate and significant. Linear mixed effects models found that sex, age, sex × age, provisioning, trial number, date, time of day, season, and distance to the closest monkey were not related to personality. Linear mixed effects models of females older than 2 years found that high rank was associated with greater caution around novel objects. Linear models were used to determine whether sex, age, group membership, maternal kinship, or relatedness had independent effects on the personality similarity of dyads. These analyses found that pairs of macaques that lived in the same group were less similar in their caution around novel objects, more closely related pairs of macaques were more similar in their tendency to eat novel food, and that pairs of macaques in the same group were more similar in how cautious they were around novel foods. Together, these findings suggest that personality in this population of wild monkeys was driven by rank, genetic effects, and group effects, the latter possibly including the need to exploit different niches in the environment. © 2016, The Author(s).","Exploration; Genetics; Inheritance; Macaque; Personality","gene; genetics; maternal effect; primate; Macaca; Macaca fuscata; animal; cultural anthropology; DNA sequence; female; genetics; Macaca; male; maternal inheritance; personality; physiology; psychology; social behavior; Animals; Culture; Female; Macaca; Male; Maternal Inheritance; Personality; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Social Behavior","Weiss, A.; Department of Psychology, School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, 7 George Square, United Kingdom; email: alex.weiss@ed.ac.uk",,"Springer Tokyo",00328332,,,"27619670","English","Primates",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987630583

We also examined intake responses during subsequent recovery from SR or TSD and investigated gender differences.

Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentarywe highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter- and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, whilemeasuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability). © 2016 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","Behaviour; Phenotypic variation; Physiology; Reaction norm; Repeatability; Temperament","animal; animal behavior; biology; personality; phenotype; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biology; Personality; Phenotype","Roche, D.G.; Département d'Éco-Éthologie, Institut de Biologie, Université de NeuchâtelSwitzerland; email: dominique.roche@mail.mcgill.ca",,"Company of Biologists Ltd",00220949,,JEBIA,"27852750","English","J.

These differences are often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for the development of personality in animals. Significance statement: Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is, individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this study, we observed that personality differences were not present at juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual behavioral plasticity.

Personality traits, consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies so far have investigated the link between personality traits and dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked to the proactive–reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups, dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that proactive–reactive personality traits do not contribute to the establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance hierarchies found in nature. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","activity; behavioural syndrome; David's score; dominance hierarchy; exploration; field observations; neophilia; proactive–reactive; repeatability; social status","behavioral ecology; dominance; field method; hierarchical system; social behavior; social status; songbird; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Parus atricapillus; Passeriformes","Morand-Ferron, J.; Department of Biology, University of Ottawa, 30 Marie Curie, Gendron Hall, Canada; email: jmf@uottawa.ca",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Animal personality is defined as the repeatable between-individual differences in behaviour over time and contexts. Some personality traits, such as activity or aggression, have received much attention while other behaviours, such as habitat preference or learning, have been neglected. 2. Wormlion larvae are sit-and-wait dipteran predators that inhabit shaded microhabitats in the field and also prefer shade in the laboratory. The aim of the present study was to examine wormlion larvae behavioural repeatability in general and specifically in the context of habitat preference. In order to achieve this, three experiments were conducted to determine whether, to what extent and under which conditions wormlion preference for shaded microhabitats is repeatable. 3. Individual tendency to relocate when the environment conditions deteriorate was also assessed, by switching between shaded and illuminated conditions, either with or without pit destruction. 4. Larvae showed a highly repeatable preference for shade. Repeatability was detected in additional behavioural traits: pit construction, pit area and tendency to relocate. 5. This behavioural repeatability was demonstrated under constant microhabitat conditions, with distinct behaviours in each setting. Under constant illumination, wormlions constructed smaller pits, moved over longer distances and were found at the tray edges more frequently than under constant shade conditions, suggesting that illuminated environments are perceived as risky or unsuitable. 6. Switching between the two microhabitat conditions without pit destruction induced fewer relocations than switching with pit destruction, suggesting that wormlions do not tend to abandon their pits, even if their microhabitat conditions deteriorate. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society","Antlion; habitat selection; personality; relocation; trap-building predators","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; environmental conditions; habitat selection; insect; learning; light effect; microhabitat; predator; relocation; shade tolerance; trap (equipment); Animalia; Diptera","Scharf, I.; Department of Zoology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv UniversityIsrael; email: scharfi@post.tau.ac.il",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",03076946,,EENTD,,"English","Ecol.

We therefore tested if the concentrations of oxytocin and other hormones reveal mate preferences of 13 mares in estrus. Each mare was first exposed to two stallions (haphazardly selected out of seven) and her behavior recorded. The mare was then returned to her box (i.e., no contact to stallions during that time). Approximately 4.5 hours later, venous blood samples were collected every minute during 30 minutes preceding exposure to one of the two previously used stallions, 6 minutes during exposure, and 30 minutes after exposure back in the mare's box. The procedure was repeated in the consecutive estrus cycle, with the difference that the mare was each exposed to the other of the two stallions during oxytocin measurements. In 20 of the 26 trials, oxytocin concentrations were significantly elevated during exposure to the stallion, without significant associations to cortisol and estradiol concentrations. We found no significant association between oxytocin secretion and preferences in the previous choice situation. While estradiol concentration showed a high repeatability over the two cycles, we found considerable intraindividual differences in oxytocin and cortisol plasma concentration among the two cycles. Partially, the variation in oxytocin concentrations could be linked to the time of ovulation, with lower oxytocin plasma concentrations in mares which ovulated later than expected. In conclusion, when teasing under experimental conditions, we found high interindividual and intraindividual variation among mares in the increase of oxytocin plasma concentrations, depending on the timing of ovulation. However, oxytocin levels seemed to be no predictor of mare preference. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Cortisol; Equine; Estradiol; Mate preference; Oxytocin; Teasing","estradiol; hydrocortisone; oxytocin; animal; blood; clinical trial; estrus; female; horse; male; metabolism; physiology; sexual behavior; Animals; Estradiol; Estrus; Female; Horses; Hydrocortisone; Male; Oxytocin; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Burger, D.; Swiss Institute of Equine Medicine, Agroscope and University of BerneSwitzerland; email: dominik.burger@vetsuisse.unibe.ch",,"Elsevier Inc.",0093691X,,THGNB,"27587272","English","Theriogenology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015270526

Populations of Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits. Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex, while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that fish caught from environments without predators and with probable intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes, relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of studying temperament within a community ecology context. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","behavioural divergence; boldness; dispersal; intraspecific variability; personality","behavioral response; desert; divergence; environmental factor; food; individual variation; intraspecific competition; intraspecific variation; perciform; refuge; refugee; social behavior; Australia; Gobiidae","Moran, N.P.; Clayton Campus, Wellington Road, Australia; email: Nicholaspatrickmoran@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Individuals coping style was characterized through behavior tests at four different ages, categorizing fish into proactive or reactive: a hypoxia avoidance test (at 255 days post hatching, dph) and 3 risk-taking tests (at 276, 286 and 304 dph). We observed significant heritability of the coping style, higher for the average of risk-taking scores (h2 = 0.45 ± 0.14) than for the hypoxia avoidance test (h2 = 0.19 ± 0.10). The genetic correlations between the three risktaking scores were very high (rA = 0.96±0.99) showing that although their repeatability was moderately high (rP = 0.64±0.72), successive risk-taking tests evaluated the same genetic variation. A mild genetic correlation between the results of the hypoxia avoidance test and the average of risk-taking scores (0.45 ± 0.27) suggested that hypoxia avoidance and risktaking tests do not address exactly the same behavioral and physiological responses. Genetic correlations between weight and risk taking traits showed negative values whatever the test used in our population i.e. reactive individual weights were larger. The results of this quantitative genetic analysis suggest a potential for the development of selection programs based on coping styles that could increase seabass welfare without altering growth performances. Overall, it also contributes to a better understanding of the origin and the significance of individual behavioral differences. © 2016 Ferrari et al.

Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15–21 % more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. Significance statement: This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral strategy. © 2016, The Author(s).","Animal personality; Behavioral syndrome; Compensatory growth; Food restriction; Mirror aggression; Open-field activity; Repeatability","aggression; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; bioenergetics; body size; compensation; food availability; growth rate; mortality risk; salmonid; survival; swimming behavior; Animalia; Salmo trutta","Näslund, J.; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 463, Sweden; email: joacim.naslund@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Methods: Detailed psychometric analysis of the BIS/BAS Scales were conducted on a large normative sample of healthy adults (N= 1430, mean age 29.36 years) in a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based research design. Measures: Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ). Results: The reliability analysis indicated good internal consistency for the instrument and high intraclass correlations further indicated temporal stability. Exploratory factor analysis revealed fi ve factors, which taken together, explained 57% of the total variance. In contrast with the four-structure model, the confi rmatory factor analysis supports the revised RST theory that discriminates the construct of Anxiety from Fear. Results of convergent and discriminant validity are consistent with the literature. Conclusion: The Hungarian version of BIS/BAS Scales can effectively measure the sensitivity of behaviour activation and inhibition system, however future empirical studies are required to verify the revised RST theory.","BIS-BAS Scales; Psychometric analysis; Reliability and validity",,,,"Akademiai Kiado Rt.",00250279,,,,"Hungarian","Magyar Pszichol.

Furthermore, elements of an animal’s internal state, such as energy or fat reserves, and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this, we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e., variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences. Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that individuals face throughout their lives. Significance statement: Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel environment). These results highlight the sensitivity of behavioral differences to elements of state, such as infection status. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Animal personality; Boldness; Field cricket; Gryllus; Immune function; Repeatability","Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gryllidae; Gryllinae; Gryllus; Gryllus integer; Serratia marcescens","DiRienzo, N.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, PO Box 210088, United States; email: ndirienzo@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Behaviourally mediated responses to landscape modification may generate behavioural divergence among populations along environmental gradients. We tested whether movement behaviour of red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, is repeatable and whether it varies within and between forest stands of different ages in a fragmented landscape in New York, U.S.A. Water loss is a major constraint on P. cinereus mobility, and forest fragmentation creates spatial variation in desiccation risk. We quantified multiple components of individual movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment in the laboratory and used ordination to identify behavioural variation among individuals in multivariate space. We tested for repeatability of individual behaviour and then examined behavioural differences between individuals captured from populations at two spatial scales where desiccation risk was expected to vary: (1) between edge and interior locations within forest stands and (2) between forest stands varying in time since agricultural abandonment. Variation in movement behaviour among individuals was characterized by three components: total movement activity (e.g. surface activity, distance moved, boundary crossings), substrate use (time on moist soil versus dry sand) and latency to initial movement. Each behavioural component was significantly repeatable. At the population level, individuals from old forest stands (≥77 years) showed greater movement activity than individuals from young stands. Movement behaviour did not differ between individuals from edge and interior locations within forest stands. Our results demonstrate that P. cinereus individuals show consistent differences in movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment. Moreover, we show that movement behaviour can be spatially structured within fragmented landscapes, but that behavioural divergence among populations depends on spatial scale. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","amphibian; behavioural syndrome; dispersal; environmental change; forestry; habitat fragmentation; landscape change; movement; personality; repeatability","behavioral response; divergence; environmental change; environmental gradient; habitat fragmentation; landscape change; lizard; movement; spatial variation; woodland; New York [United States]; United States; Amphibia; Plethodon; Plethodon cinereus","Cosentino, B.J.; Department of Biology, Hobart and William Smith CollegesUnited States; email: cosentino@hws.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

When these behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted within the “coping style” framework. As studying inter-individual variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second, explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters were highly repeatable across seasons, indicating that the individual stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was considerable covariation among the stress response parameters, describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level. Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food acquisition tactics and demographic performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Body mass; Capture; Coping styles; Repeatability; Roe deer","behavioral response; bioenergetics; body mass; deer; geographical variation; herbivore; metabolism; phenotype; physiological response; acute stress; coping behavior; energy metabolism; herbivore; nonhuman; physiology; quantitative study; roe deer; season; adaptive behavior; animal; animal behavior; body temperature; body weight; deer; female; hematocrit; herbivory; individuality; leukocyte count; male; mental stress; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; reproducibility; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Deer; Female; Hematocrit; Herbivory; Individuality; Leukocyte Count; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons; Stress, Psychological","Monestier, C.; CEFS, Université de Toulouse, INRAFrance; email: monestier.chloe@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"27646701","English","Behav.

However, the general relationship between individuals’ body state and various personality metrics/average behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals’ body condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals’ average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A. studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A. studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial effects on individuals’ average personality type and the correlations between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust positive relationship between food availability and the signature of consistent individual differences in behavior. Significance statement: Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and boldness but not correlations between these traits. This work highlights the importance of state variables such as hunger in eroding behavioral repeatability, the defining trait of personality. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Araneae; Behavioral syndromes; Food stress; Personality; Temperament","aggression; behavioral ecology; body condition; feeding behavior; food availability; spider; spider web; Agelenopsis aperta; Anelosimus studiosus; Araneae; Latrodectus hesperus","Lichtenstein, J.L.L.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of PittsburghUnited States; email: jll134@pitt.edu",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

In many animals, male and female behaviour often diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring the very strong possibility that key components of personality, behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that explains the delicate skink’s successful invasion history via accidental introductions. We found that females were more social than males and showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were consistently more active explored environments faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade. Significance statement: Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual’s personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome. Our results suggest limited behavioural variation between the sexes and that both sexes may have an equal invasion potential. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioural type; Dispersal; Invasion syndrome; Life history; Repeatability","behavioral response; biological invasion; dispersal; evolutionarily stable strategy; evolutionary biology; invasive species; life history trait; lizard; sex-related difference; social behavior; Animalia; Lampropholis delicata; Scincidae; Squamata","Michelangeli, M.; School of Biological Sciences, Monash UniversityAustralia; email: marcus.michelangeli@monash.edu",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Environmental variation can lead to divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish, Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours, the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world could serve as a valuable conservation tool. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","activity; aggression; behavioural syndrome; boldness; exploration; personality; poeciliid fish; predation; sociability","activity pattern; adaptive radiation; aggression; behavioral ecology; cyprinid; divergence; environmental conditions; eusociality; exploration; predation; predation risk; prediction; Bahamas; Animalia; Gambusia affinis; Gambusia hubbsi; Poeciliidae","Heinen-Kay, J.L.; Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior, University of MinnesotaUnited States; email: justa.heinenkay@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Regarding the coping style of individuals, recent studies on personality-dependent space use within a habitat indicate that ‘proactive’ individuals are wider ranging than ‘reactive’ ones. However, such studies are still scarce and cover limited taxonomic diversity, and thus, more research is needed to explore whether this pattern generalises across species. We examined the link between coping style and space use in a population of crows (Corvus corone) freely inhabiting the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria. We used a binary docility rating (struggle during handling vs. no struggle) and a tonic immobility test to quantify individual coping style. Individual space use was quantified as the number of different sites at which each crow was observed, and we controlled for different number of sightings per individual by creating a space use index. Only the binary docility rating showed repeatability over time, and significantly predicted space use. In contrast to previous studies, we found that reactive crows (no struggle during handling) showed wider ranging space use within the study site than proactive individuals (who struggled during handling). The discrepancy from previous results suggests that the relationship between behavioural type and space use may vary between species, potentially reflecting differences in socioecology. © 2016 The Authors Ethology Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH","antipredator; coping style; docility; personality; space use; tonic immobility","antipredator defense; behavioral response; dispersal; fitness; habitat use; immobilization; passerine; survival; wild population; zoo; Austria; Vienna; Corvidae; Corvus corone","Deventer, S.A.; Department of Cognitive Biology, University of ViennaAustria; email: Sarah.Deventer@univie.ac.at",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990938405

This variation will probably have broad biological and methodological implications to the study of trait variation in labile traits, such as behaviour and physiology, though we currently need studies to quantify variation in rIIV, using more standardized and powerful methodology. Focusing on activity rates in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we provide a model example, from sampling design to data analysis, in how to quantify rIIV in labile traits. Building on the doubly hierarchical generalized linear model recently used to quantify individual differences in rIIV, we extend the model to evaluate the covariance between individual mean values and their rIIV. After accounting for time-related change in behaviour, our guppies substantially differed in rIIV, and it was the active individuals that tended to be more consistent (lower rIIV). We provide annotated data analysis code to implement these complex models, and discuss how to further generalize the model to evaluate covariances with other aspects of phenotypic variation. © 2016 The Authors.","Behavioural plasticity; Behavioural predictability; Behavioural syndrome; Multiple burst; Repeatability; Residual model",,"Mitchell, D.J.; Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life and Environmental Science, Deakin UniversityAustralia; email: david.mitchell@deakin.edu.au",,"Royal Society Publishing",20545703,,,,"English","R.

Hence, alterations to endocrine factors may dramatically affect individual behavior that has subsequent fitness consequences. Yet it is unclear how hormonal or behavioral traits change with environmental stressors or over multiple reproductive opportunities, particularly for biparental fauna. To simulate an environmental stressor, we exposed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs to novel coyote odor attractants (i.e. commercial scent lures) mid-gestation to influence territorial behaviors, fecal glucocorticoid (FGMs) and fecal androgen metabolites (FAMs). In addition, we observed coyote pairs as first-time and experienced breeders to assess the influence of parity on our measures. Treatment pairs received the odors four times over a 20-day period, while control pairs received water. Odor-treated pairs scent-marked (e.g. urinated, ground scratched) and investigated odors more frequently than control pairs, and had higher FAMs when odors were provided. Pairs had higher FAMs as first-time versus experienced breeders, indicating that parity also affected androgen production during gestation. Moreover, repeatability in scent-marking behaviors corresponded with FGMs and FAMs, implying that coyote territoriality during gestation is underpinned by individually-specific hormone profiles. Our results suggest coyote androgens during gestation are sensitive to conspecific olfactory stimuli and prior breeding experience. Consequently, fluctuations in social or other environmental stimuli as well as increasing parity may acutely affect coyote traits essential to reproductive success. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Androgens; Coyotes; Glucocorticoids; Parity; Personality; Repeatability","androgen; glucocorticoid; androgen; fragrance; glucocorticoid; androgen synthesis; Article; breeding; concentration (parameters); controlled study; coyote; female; male; nonhuman; odor; parity; pregnancy; priority journal; smelling; territoriality; aggression; animal; chemistry; coyote; exploratory behavior; feces; mental stress; metabolism; motor activity; parity; physiology; reproducibility; sexual development; social behavior; Aggression; Androgens; Animals; Coyotes; Exploratory Behavior; Feces; Female; Glucocorticoids; Male; Motor Activity; Odorants; Parity; Pregnancy; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics; Social Behavior; Stress, Psychological; Territoriality","Schell, C.J.; USDA/APHIS/WS/NWRC, 4101 LaPorte Avenue, United States; email: cjschell@colostate.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",00319384,,PHBHA,"27378509","English","Physiol.

In response to nest predation, many bird species produce specific sounds, such as the hissing calls in incubating great tits (Parus major), that may provoke an acoustic startle response in the predator. However, it is still unclear whether the propensity of incubating females to produce hissing calls towards nest predators depends on the reproductive investment. With our 3-year study, we show that response type (females that do not hiss versus females giving hissing calls) to a potential nest predator, the woodpecker, is a repeatable trait. We found no differences in the studied reproductive traits between hissing and non-hissing birds. Interestingly, among hissing birds, fast-responding females started egg-laying earlier than slow-responding ones. Among non-hissing birds, heavier birds initiated clutches earlier. We also revealed that hissing birds breed in areas with decreased nest-box occupancy, suggesting either that they potentially select different areas to breed or that territory size is larger as a result of hissing birds being more aggressive. These findings demonstrate that response type is not related to the early reproductive value of the brood across distinct behavioural groups. However, our results do suggest that non-hissing and hissing females differ in terms of individual quality or dominance or personality related aspects. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.","Anti-predator behaviour; Lay-date; Nest defence; Nesting density; Parus major; Repeatability",,"Koosa, K.; Department of Zoology, Institute of Ecology and Earth Sciences, Tartu University, Vanemuise 46, Estonia; email: kaarin.koosa@ut.ee",,"Springer Verlag",08739749,,AECTD,,"English","Acta Ethol.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978153658

This wild rodent is expanding its original distribution to disturbed areas in the Atlantic Forest biome in response to anthropogenic impacts, acting as an invasive species (broad sense). In order to evaluate personality, we performed three behavioural assays as follows: open field, aversive open field and holeboard field. We extracted three personality domains—activity, exploration, and neophilia—using principal component analysis.

Levels of social support and posttraumatic stress may change and affect each other over time, but there are also stable time-invariant individual differences in both constructs. The present study aimed to determine the amount of variance explained by stable individual differences in levels of social support and posttraumatic stress across three years, and to determine whether and to what extent social support and posttraumatic stress may affect one another when these stable individual differences are controlled for. Methods: We used data from ministerial employees present in the Governmental district during the 2011 Oslo bombing attack (N=255). Data was collected ten months, two years, and three years after the terror attack. Using a random intercept cross lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we tested the possible directional effects between social support and posttraumatic stress within persons when variance between persons was taken into account. Results: The intraclass correlations of the three measures of posttraumatic stress and social support were.83 and.74, respectively. The remaining variation within persons could not be explained by change in either of these constructs. Limitation: We have no information on the processes that might have occurred before 10 months after the incident. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the long-term longitudinal linkage between social support and posttraumatic stress may be best explained by stable individual differences rather than causal processes operating within persons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-lagged; Longitudinal; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; Social support","adult; Article; controlled study; disease association; employee; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Norway; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; social support; terrorism; coping behavior; explosion; health service; individuality; middle aged; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; terrorism; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Explosions; Female; Health Services; Humans; Individuality; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Norway; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Terrorism","Birkeland, M.S.; Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Postbox 181 Nydalen, Norway; email: marianne.s.birkeland@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",01650327,,JADID,"27267295","English","J.

In contrast, some studies of social mole rats (including naked mole rats, Heterocephalus glaber, and Damaraland mole rats, Fukomys damarensis) suggest that individual differences in cooperative behavior are the result of divergent developmental pathways, leading to discrete and permanent functional categories of helpers that resemble the caste systems found in eusocial insects. Here we show that, in Damaraland mole rats, individual contributions to cooperative behavior increase with age and are higher in fast-growing individuals. Individual contributions to different cooperative tasks are intercorrelated and repeatability of cooperative behavior is similar to that found in other cooperatively breeding vertebrates. Our data provide no evidence that nonreproductive individuals show divergent developmental pathways or specialize in particular tasks. Instead of representing a caste system, variation in the behavior of nonreproductive individuals in Damaraland mole rats closely resembles that found in other cooperatively breeding mammals and appears to be a consequence of age-related polyethism.","Caste; Cooperative breeding; Division of labor; Eusociality; Social mole rats","age distribution; animal behavior; animal experiment; body mass; Conference Paper; cooperation; female; male; mole rat; nesting; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; progeny; rat; task performance; aging; animal; body weight; breeding; genetics; mole rat; physiology; sexual behavior; social behavior; Aging; Animals; Body Weight; Breeding; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Male; Mole Rats; Rats; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Behavior","Zöttl, M.; Department of Zoology, University of CambridgeUnited Kingdom; email: mz338@cam.ac.uk",,"National Academy of Sciences",00278424,,PNASA,"27588902","English","Proc.

Under this hypothesis, individuals with consistently high levels of behavioral activity should also have high resting metabolic rate (RMR) as it can reflect capacity to process food and generate energy. We tested for the predicted positive covariance between RMR and three behaviors that differ in energy demands in 30 male guppies, using multivariate mixed models; we repeatedly measured their activity (10 times each), courtship displays (nine times), voracity (10 times), and metabolism (four-times). Resting metabolic rate (measured overnight in respirometry trials) did not consistently differ among males, whereas initial peak metabolism measured during those same trials (R = 0.42), and all behaviors were repeatable (R = 0.33–0.51). RMR declined over time suggesting habituation to the protocol, whereas peak metabolism did not. Initial peak metabolism was negatively correlated with courtship display intensity, and voracity was positively correlated with activity, but all other among-individual correlations were not significant. We conclude that RMR does not provide a proximate explanation for consistent individual differences in behavior in male guppies, and therefore the potential for independent evolution of these physiological and behavioral traits seems possible. Finally, we identify peak metabolism as a potential measure of the stress response to confinement, which highlights the value of considering various aspects of metabolic rates recording during respirometry trials. © 2016 The Authors.

However, evidence for whether behavior correlates across asocial and social settings is mixed, and no study has linked observed trends with underlying mechanisms. Consistent differences between individuals in boldness, which describes willingness to accept reward over risk, are likely to be under strong selection pressure. By testing three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in a risky foraging task alone and repeatedly in shoals, we demonstrate that the expression of boldness in groups is context-specific. Whereas personality is repeatable in a low-risk behavior (leaving a refuge), the collectively made consensus decision to then cross the arena outweighs leadership by bolder individuals, explaining the suppression of personality in this context. However, despite this social coordination, bolder individuals were still more likely to feed. Habituation and satiation over repeated trials degrade the effect of personality on leaving the refuge and also whether crossing the arena is a collective decision. The suppression of personality in groups suggests that individual risk-taking tendency may rarely represent actual risk in social settings, with implications for the evolution and ecology of personality variation. © 2016 The Authors.",,"Collective behavior; Collective decision; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Individual behavior; Selection pressures; Social coordination; Three-spined sticklebacks; Willingness to accept; Risk management; animal; animal behavior; ecology; evolution; personality; physiology; predation; risk; Smegmamorpha; social behavior; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Personality; Predatory Behavior; Risk; Smegmamorpha; Social Behavior","Ioannou, C.C.; School of Biological Sciences, University of BristolUnited Kingdom; email: c.c.ioannou@bristol.ac.uk",,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",23752548,,,"27652342","English","Sci.

Swimming velocity during the test was higher in fish infected with glochidia, suggesting that high activity could increase their exposure to glochidia. Potentially, as metabolism rate and ventilation rate typically increase with activity, elevated activity may lead to an increased likelihood of glochidia passing over the gills. This novel finding suggests that glochidia infestation is non-random and that the behaviour of the host fish can influence the likelihood of glochidia infestation. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","animal personality; behavioural repeatability; glochidia; mussel conservation; parasites; reintroduction","activity pattern; behavioral response; bivalve; conservation planning; encystment; freshwater environment; metabolism; parasite infestation; salmonid; tagging; ventilation; Sweden; Animalia; Margaritifera margaritifera; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae","Wengström, N.; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of GothenburgSweden; email: niklas.wengstrom@bioenv.gu.se",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983003958

Besides answering questions about work schedules in all waves, the nurses completed the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS), assessing workaholism, both in the 2012 and the 2014 waves. In the 2012 wave, personality was measured by the Mini-International Personality Item Pool (Mini-IPIP). Intraclass correlation analysis showed a high stability of workaholism across the 24-month follow-up period, although a small but significant increase over time was found. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted in order to identify factors that could explain change in workaholism across the follow-up period. The results showed that Neuroticism was positively associated with an increase in workaholism. Starting to have at least one child in the household during the same period was negatively associated with an increase in workaholism. Those categorized as stable non-workaholics had lower scores on Neuroticism compared to all other nurses.

The Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) is a widely used self-report measurement of resilience. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of a Brazilian Portuguese version of the CD-RISC. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional validation study carried out in the outpatient clinics of a public university hospital. METHODS: The cross-cultural adaptation followed established guidelines and involved interviews with 65 adults in psychiatric and non-psychiatric outpatient clinics at a teaching hospital. Validation was assessed through concurrent application of the Lipp Brazilian Stress Symptom Inventory (ISSL), Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ), Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS) and Chronic Pain Grade (CPG) to 575 patients at the same setting. Temporal stability was verified through a second application to 123 participants. RESULTS: Factor analysis identified four factors, named tenacity, adaptability-tolerance, reliance on support from outside and intuition. The alpha coefficient of 0.93 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.84 indicated good internal consistency and temporal stability. Significant correlations between this version of the CD-RISC and the ISSL, SRQ, SDS and CPG were noted. The patients at the outpatient clinic for borderline personality had resilience scores that were significantly lower than those of the patients at the general anxiety or post-traumatic stress outpatient clinics. CONCLUSION: This Brazilian Portuguese version of the Connor-Davidson resilience scale exhibited adequate reliability and validity among a sample of Brazilian adult patients. © 2016, Sao Paulo Medical Journal.

Additionally, the correlation between differences in individual boldness and stress reactivity was examined, exploring indications of individual coping styles. Heterodontus portusjacksoni demonstrated highly repeatable individual differences in boldness and stress reactivity. Individual boldness scores were highly repeatable across four trials such that individuals that were the fastest to emerge in the first trial were also the fastest to emerge in subsequent trials. Additionally, individuals that were the most reactive to a handling stressor in the first trial were also the most reactive in a second trial. The strong link between boldness and stress response commonly found in teleosts was also evident in this study, providing evidence of proactive-reactive coping styles in H. portusjacksoni. These results demonstrate the presence of individual personality differences in sharks for the first time.

Such measurements have been then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context. Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts. Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same individuals show under natural conditions. Significance statement: Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects the variation that the same individuals would show if the same measurements were taken directly in their natural habitat. Here, we used wild African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. Using similar protocols, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context and then compared measurements across the two different contexts. We showed that personality measures from standardized laboratory conditions are consistent with field measurements for all personality traits considered. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Context-dependent behavioural syndrome; Dyadic encounter; Novel object; Open field; Rhabdomys pumilio","aggression; environmental factor; fitness; laboratory method; life history trait; rodent; survival; Animalia; Mus; Rhabdomys pumilio","Yuen, C.H.; School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandSouth Africa; email: bt8205@yahoo.co.uk",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

(ii) What are the contributions of genetic and plastic effects to this behavioural divergence? (iii) And to what extent are responses to predation and parasitism repeatable across independent evolutionary lineages? We addressed these questions using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (i) varying in their exposure to dangerous fish predators and Gyrodactylus ectoparasites for (ii) both wild-caught F0 and laboratory-reared F2 individuals and coming from (iii) multiple independent evolutionary lineages (i.e. independent drainages). Several key findings emerged. First, a population's history of predation and parasitism influenced behavioural profiles, but to different extent depending on the behaviour considered (activity, shoaling or boldness). Second, we had evidence for some genetic effects of predation regime on behaviour, with differences in activity of F2 laboratory-reared individuals, but not for parasitism, which had only plastic effects on the boldness of wild-caught F0 individuals. Third, the two lineages showed a mixture of parallel and nonparallel responses to predation/parasitism, with parallel responses being stronger for predation than for parasitism and for activity and boldness than for shoaling. These findings suggest that different sets of behaviours provide different pay-offs in alternative predation/parasitism environments and that parasitism has more transient effects in shaping intraspecific variation of behaviour than does predation. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

It is unclear, however, whether and how increased environmental variability – and thus reduced predictability of resources – due to global climate change will affect individual specialization. We determined the within- and among-individual components of the trophic niche and the within-individual repeatability of δ13C and δ15N in feathers and red blood cells of individual female southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) across 7 years. We also investigated the effect of environmental variables (Southern Annular Mode, Southern Oscillation Index, and local sea surface temperature anomaly) on the isotopic values, as well as the link between stable isotopes and female body mass, clutch initiation dates, and total clutch mass. We observed consistent red blood cell δ13C and δ15N values within individuals among years, suggesting a moderate degree of within-individual specialization in C and N during the prebreeding period. However, the total niche width was reduced and individual specialization not present during the premolt period. Despite significant interannual differences in isotope values of C and N and environmental conditions, none of the environmental variables were linked to stable isotope values and thus able to explain phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, neither the within-individual nor among-individual effects of stable isotopes were found to be related to female body mass, clutch initiation date, or total clutch mass. In conclusion, our results emphasize that the degree of specialization within generalist populations can vary over the course of 1 year, even when being consistent within the same season across years. We were unable to confirm that environmental variability counteracts individual specialization in foraging behavior, as phenotypic plasticity in δ13C and δ15N was not linked to any of the environmental variables studied. © 2016 The Authors.

(2006) proposed a new approach to classify specific sub-types of non-melancholic depression caused by various stress factors and premorbid personality styles: The Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P). The current study aim was to develop the Japanese version of the T&P and evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods We studied 114 patients with non-melancholic depression. Reliability was assessed using the test-retest method. Convergent validity of the T&P was compared with the clinician ratings of each patient for the eight personality traits. We also assessed the impact of depressive state on the T&P. Results The test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients among eight constructs of the T&P ranged from 0.77 to 0.89, indicating good-to-excellent reliability. Anxious Worrying (rho=0.29), Perfectionism (rho=0.17), Personal Reserve (rho=0.18), Irritability (rho=0.38), and Social Avoidance (rho=0.32) showed adequate levels of convergent validity; Rejection Sensitivity (rho=0.16), Self-criticism (rho=-0.02), and Self-focus (rho=0.07) showed relatively weak convergent validity. Perfectionism (rho=-0.06), Social Avoidance (rho=0.17), Anxious Worrying (rho=0.40), Personal Reserve (rho=0.30), Irritability (rho=0.28), Rejection Sensitivity (rho=0.35), Self-criticism (rho=0.49), and Self-focus (rho=0.24) showed minimal sensitivity to mood state effects. Limitations Only one site was used. While a Likert scale was used, the clinician-rated personality trait measure had not been validated. Conclusions The J-T&P is a reliable and valid measure for assessing temperament and personality in Japanese patients with non-melancholic depression. © 2016 The Authors.

If acoustic signals are consistent and related to an individual's personality, these consistent individual differences in signalling may be an important driver in social interactions. However, few studies in non-human mammals have investigated the relationship between acoustic signalling and personality. Here we show that acoustic signalling rate is repeatable and strongly related to personality in a highly social mammal, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica). Furthermore, acoustic signalling varied between environments of differing quality, with males from a poor-quality environment having a reduced vocalization rate compared with females and males from an enriched environment. Such differences may be mediated by personality with pigs from a poor-quality environment having more reactive and more extreme personality scores compared with pigs from an enriched environment. Our results add to the evidence that acoustic signalling reflects personality in a non-human mammal. Signals reflecting personalities may have far reaching consequences in shaping the evolution of social behaviours as acoustic communication forms an integral part of animal societies. © 2016 The Authors.","Acoustic signalling; Animal personality; Environmental enrichment; Pig",,"Collins, L.M.; School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, United Kingdom; email: lcollins@lincoln.ac.uk",,"Royal Society Publishing",20545703,,,,"English","R.

Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation, and whether or not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs, and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system. Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of 'novel object exploration', 'boldness' and 'activity in an unknown area' to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females' strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared when the size difference between the stimulus males was small. Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating decisions, respectively. © 2016 The Author(s).","Animal personality; Assortative mating; Ecological speciation; Local adaptation; Mate choice; Premating isolation","body size; conspecific; cyprinid; decision making; hybridization; hydrogen sulfide; isolated population; local adaptation; mate choice; phenotypic plasticity; preference behavior; reproductive strategy; Animalia; Poecilia mexicana; animal; body size; ecosystem; female; genetics; hybridization; male; mate choice; personality; phenotype; physiology; Poecilia; reproduction; reproductive isolation; sexual behavior; Animals; Body Size; Ecosystem; Female; Hybridization, Genetic; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Personality; Phenotype; Poecilia; Reproduction; Reproductive Isolation; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Sommer-Trembo, C.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest AandF UniversityChina; email: sommercarolin@gmx.net",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712148,,,"27338278","English","BMC Evol.

In particular, according to the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis, individual variation in metabolic expenditure and stress physiology should be linked with exploration, aggression, or risk-taking behaviors. Previous studies have uncovered stable individual differences in metabolic expenditure and circulating glucorticoids in common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). We tested the correlations between standard metabolic rates (SMR), glucorticoid stress response, and behavioral traits (activity, aggressiveness, risk taking, and sociability) in males. In ectotherms, the thermal dependence of SMR should be included in the POLS hypothesis; we therefore measured SMR at three temperatures from rest to preferred body temperature. Activity, aggressiveness, and risk taking, but not sociability, exhibited significant, short-term repeatability, and little correlation was found between behavioral traits. The SMR of lizards with a low metabolism at rest increased faster with body temperature. The SMR at rest was negatively correlated with behavioral variation in sociability and activity but not with risk-taking behavior. In addition, the plasma corticosterone level after an acute handling stress increased slightly but not significantly with aggressiveness. We discuss alternative interpretations for these relationships and conclude that the link between inter-individual variation in physiology and behavior is trait-dependent in the common lizard. Significance statement: Selection better promotes the evolution of consistent differences in behavior, or personalities, when they are coupled with differences in physiology. In adult common lizards, inter-individual differences in metabolic expenditure and glucocorticoid stress response are consistent and could play a crucial role in the maintenance of personalities. This study supported partially this hypothesis. We found that more sociable and active personality types had a lower metabolic expenditure, while more aggressive personality types tended to have a higher physiological stress response. At the same time, physiology was not correlated with individual differences in risk-taking behavior and drove little part of behavioral variation. The coupling between personalities and physiology appears to be trait-dependent, suggesting that behaviors may be relatively free to evolve independently from physiology. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Corticosterone; Locomotion; Metabolism; Personality; Reptiles; Temperament","adult; aggregation behavior; bioenergetics; body temperature; environmental stress; evolutionary theory; interspecific variation; lizard; metabolism; risk perception; steroid; temperature effect; Reptilia; Squamata; Zootoca vivipara","Le Galliard, J.-F.; iEES Paris, UMR 7618 Université Pierre et Marie Curie, CNRS, 7 Quai St. Bernard, France; email: galliard@biologie.ens.fr",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

To address this issue, we investigated whether the disparity in territorial aggression of urban and rural male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, is individually consistent within a breeding period. Additionally, to better understand the physiological and ecological factors underlying this behavioural difference, we examined whether territoriality was associated with plasma testosterone, a hormone that contributes to elevated aggression in vertebrates, and/or conspecific density, a factor often positively related to aggression. The urbanization-related difference in territoriality was individually consistent within a breeding period. However, the elevated territorial aggression of urban birds was not associated with plasma testosterone and, counter to our predictions, conspecific density was lower in urban compared with rural areas. We suggest that other aspects of testosterone signalling and features of the socio-ecological environment, such as the availability of breeding sites, may underlie increased territorial aggression in urban birds. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We found that personality traits (exploration, boldness, activity) of P. wingei males were highly repeatable across long time spans, but they were not correlated (formed no behavioural syndrome). Male age and social environment had no effect on any personality trait, despite their effects on alternative mating behaviour. Young males with higher activity levels were more likely to attempt sneaking. In older fish, there was an association between orange coloration, courtship and boldness, but this was not observed in young males.

Although empirical studies have investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different levels (between-partner, or partner 'personality', and within-partner levels, or partner 'plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test whether partners represent a component of the social environment affecting the expression of labile traits. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Interaction coefficient; Same-sex sexual behaviour; Trait-based approach; Variance-partitioning approach; Water strider","insect; intraspecific interaction; life history trait; male behavior; multivariate analysis; phenotype; sexual behavior; variance analysis; Gerridae; Gerris lacustris","Han, C.S.; Behavioural Ecology, Department of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of MunichGermany; email: hcspol@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Thus, prey species should be able to discriminate between different predator types and adjust their response to the imminent predation risk. In our current study, we evaluated the relative importance of innate versus learned components of predator recognition and avoidance in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). We used a feral guppy population occurring in Germany and compared avoidance reactions of each focal individual towards both coevolved piscine predators from their original distribution range and novel, presently co-occurring predator species. Wild-caught, predator-experienced as well as laboratory-reared, predator-naïve individuals showed strong avoidance responses towards all predator animations. Avoidance was stronger in small-bodied than in large-bodied individuals in both cohorts; however, this effect was significant only in predator-naïve fish. Moreover, wild-caught individuals showed a significantly higher within-individual variance (across the six predator species) along with a lower among-individual variance in predator avoidance, which resulted in a lower behavioral repeatability in this cohort. Our results suggest that consistent individual differences in risk-taking behavior (also referred to as the personality trait ‘boldness’) are modified by predator exposure and learning about predators. © 2016, Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan.","Animal personality; Computer animation; Learning; Poecilia reticulata; Predator recognition; Risk-taking behavior",,"Sommer-Trembo, C.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F UniversityChina; email: sommercarolin@gmx.net",,"Springer Tokyo",02890771,,JOETE,,"English","J.

However, the presence of consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural plasticity; Context-dependent behaviour; Gambusia; Ontogeny; Personality; Repeatability; Size scaling; Temperament","behavioral ecology; cyprinid; hypothesis testing; individual variation; juvenile; ontogeny; vulnerability; Animalia; Gambusia; Gambusia affinis; Gambusia holbrooki","Polverino, G.; Department of Biology and Ecology of Fishes, Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Müggelseedamm 310, Germany; email: polverino@igb-berlin.de",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We examined here the behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge). We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies. Significance statement: We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage, and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important, because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on differences between males and females, probably indicating on differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging. Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Activity; Behavioral consistency; Centrophobism; Dispersal; Movement; Tenebrionidae; Tribolium castaneum","activity pattern; age structure; aging; beetle; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; dispersal; metamorphosis; ontogeny; phenotype; sex-related difference; Amphibia; Animalia; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Tenebrionidae; Tribolium castaneum","Scharf, I.; Department of Zoology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv UniversityIsrael; email: scharfi@post.tau.ac.il",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

However, studies examining whether these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare. Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014 we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of personality on reproductive success differed between changing environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Feeding experiment; Individual quality; Life history strategy; Litter size; Silver spoon effect","adult; aggression; body mass; environmental conditions; feeding; food availability; heterogeneity; juvenile; life history; litter size; mortality; phenotype; pig; reproductive success; wild population; Animalia; Sus scrofa","Vetter, S.G.; Department of Integrative Biology and Evolution, Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Savoyenstraße 1, Austria; email: sebastian.vetter@vetmeduni.ac.at",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

It has been suggested that CIDs in the behavior of fish might explain individual differences in vulnerability to fishing. If so, fishing could impose selection on fish behavior. In this study, we assessed boldness-indicating behaviors of Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis using individually conducted experiments measuring the time taken to explore a novel arena containing predator (burbot, Lota lota) cues. We studied if individual differences in boldness would explain vulnerability of individually tagged perch to experimental angling in outdoor ponds, or if fishing would impose selection on boldness-indicating behavior. Perch expressed repeatable individual differences in boldness-indicating behavior but the individual boldness-score (the first principal component) obtained using principal component analysis combining all the measured behavioral responses did not explain vulnerability to experimental angling. Instead, large body size appeared as the only statistically significant predictor of capture probability. Our results suggest that angling is selective for large size, but not always selective for high boldness. © The Author (2016).

Individual variation in baseline hormone levels or hormonal similarity within a breeding pair may be related to reproductive success, as suggested by the corticosterone-fitness hypothesis and the hormonal similarity hypothesis, respectively. In a population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) with repeatable behavioral expression and coordination of behavior within pairs, we tested if baseline androgen and corticosterone levels are related to behavioral expression, if coordination in behavior within pairs is facilitated by hormonal coordination, and if baseline hormone levels are related to fledging success at the individual or pair level. We found no significant relationship between hormone levels and nest visit rate or nest defense for either sex. Androgen and corticosterone levels were not correlated within pairs, but pairs in which males exhibited more aggressive nest defense behavior than females were also more different in androgen levels. Females with higher baseline corticosterone levels fledged more young, but hormonal similarity within pairs was not related to fledging success.

Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks, Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects' participation and success were consistent within the same problems and across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise from inherent motivational differences alone and hence be achieved without inferring more complex cognitive processes. © 2016 The Authors.","Cognition; Foraging innovations; Phasianus colchicus; Pheasants; Problem solving","body condition; cognition; foraging behavior; gamebird; individual variation; physiological response; Phasianidae; Phasianus colchicus","Madden, J.R.; Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, Washington Singer Laboratories, Psychology, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of ExeterUnited Kingdom; email: j.r.madden@exeter.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Although natural selection acts on an individual’s phenotype, research on habitat selection often pools inter-individual patterns to provide inferences on the population scale. Here, we expanded a traditional approach of quantifying habitat selection at the individual level to explore the potential for consistent individual differences of habitat selection. We used random coefficients in resource selection functions (RSFs) and repeatability estimates to test for variability in habitat selection. We applied our method to a detailed dataset of GPS relocations of brown bears (Ursus arctos) taken over a period of 6 years, and assessed whether they displayed repeatable individual differences in habitat selection toward two habitat types: bogs and recent timber-harvest cut blocks. In our analyses, we controlled for the availability of habitat, i.e. the functional response in habitat selection. Repeatability estimates of habitat selection toward bogs and cut blocks were 0.304 and 0.420, respectively. Therefore, 30.4 and 42.0 % of the population-scale habitat selection variability for bogs and cut blocks, respectively, was due to differences among individuals, suggesting that consistent individual variation in habitat selection exists in brown bears.

In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed to estimate the individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for marsh harriers. This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for marsh harriers (corridor migration) and a higher degree of repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among marsh harriers, while individual ospreys were more flexible. Our findings suggest that individuality in space and time is not a shared trait complex among migrants, but may show adaptive variation depending on the species' life history and ecology. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bird migration; Consistency; Individual variation; Marsh harrier; Osprey; Satellite telemetry","biotelemetry; environmental change; individual variation; life history; migration route; migratory behavior; raptor; satellite altimetry; stopover; travel time; Animalia; Aves; Circus aeruginosus; Pandion; Pandion haliaetus; Raptores","Vardanis, Y.; Department of Biology, Lund University, Ecology Building, Sweden; email: yannis.vardanis@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Underlying this concept is the assumption that individuals will display consistent levels of performance in fitness-related traits and interest has focused on individual variation and broad sense repeatability in a range of behavioural and physiological traits. Despite playing a central role in maintenance and growth, and with considerable inter-individual variation documented, broad sense repeatability in rates of protein synthesis has not been assessed. In this study we show for the first time that juvenile flounder Platichthys flesus reared under controlled environmental conditions on the same plane of nutrition for 46 days maintain consistent whole-animal absolute rates of protein synthesis (As). By feeding meals containing 15N-labelled protein and using a stochastic end-point model, two non-terminal measures of protein synthesis were made 32 days apart (d14 and d46). As values (mass-corrected to a standard mass of 12 g) showed 2- to 3-fold variation between individuals on d14 and d46 but individuals showed similar As values on both days with a broad sense repeatability estimate of 0.684 indicating significant consistency in physiological performance under controlled experimental conditions. The use of non-terminal methodologies in studies of animal ecophysiology to make repeat measures of physiological performance enables known individuals to be tracked across changing conditions. Adopting this approach, repeat measures of protein synthesis under controlled conditions will allow individual ontogenetic changes in protein metabolism to be assessed to better understand the ageing process and to determine individual physiological adaptive capacity, and associated energetic costs of adaptation, to global environmental change. © 2016 McCarthy et al.

Yet, almost nothing is known of the plasticity of the metabolic response under dynamically changing conditions that are representative of the natural environment. This is surprising since the capacity for animals to cope with rapidly changing environments depends on phenotypic variation and plasticity among members of the population. We measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) of 60 juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) under acclimation conditions (35 ppt salinity, 29 °C, normoxia) and when the fish were sequentially faced with low salinity (10 ppt), high temperature (35 °C) and hypoxia (45% air saturation) with each treatment separated by ∼12 days. The overall degree of interindividual variation in body-mass-standardised SMR, MMR and AS changed with environmental conditions, and a metabolic coupling was revealed between SMR and MMR when the fish were faced with the environmental changes. The metabolic response to environmental change differed widely and predictably at an individual level. Individuals that had elevated metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions showed little change in SMR, MMR or AS in response to low salinity and high temperature, but MMR and AS were greatly depressed by hypoxia. In contrast, individuals with low-metabolic attributes under acclimation conditions displayed a substantial increase in SMR, MMR and AS in response to high temperature and (to a lesser extent) low salinity, but hypoxia had very little effect. These findings reveal how phenotypic diversity in key physiological traits can create differential plasticity towards environmental change within a population by showing how individual fish can remain metabolically insensitive to one environmental stressor at the cost of being highly sensitive to another. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Barramundi; Climate change; Food intake; Growth rate; Interindividual variation; Intraspecific variation; Repeatability","acclimation; age structure; body mass; climate change; environmental change; food intake; growth rate; high temperature; interspecific variation; life history trait; metabolism; phenotypic plasticity; tropical environment; Animalia; Lates calcarifer","Norin, T.; Australian Institute of Marine Science, PMB 3, Australia; email: tommy.norin@biology.au.dk",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02698463,,FECOE,,"English","Funct.

Therefore, even individuals of the same species experiencing similar environmental conditions can exhibit different behavioural responses, as these responses can be highly repeatable within individuals. Here, we investigated the nocturnal movement behaviour of a territorial species, by radiotracking 26 eagle owls Bubo bubo in order to analyze within and between individual variation with respect to movement parameters and route choice. Owls showed a considerable individual consistency in all movement parameters and made repeated use of similar routes while moving within fixed home ranges. Thus, movement parameters varied much less between repeated nightly trajectories than between different individuals. Furthermore, when we compared different individuals inhabiting the same territory in different years, within-group repeatability was low or non-significant suggesting that the spatial configuration of habitat does not always represents one of the main drivers in animal movement behaviour. Similarly, male individuals appeared to exhibit greater repeatability than females. The overall pattern of repeatability we found seems to identify such consistent movement behaviour not only as the expression of individual response to external/internal inputs but also as an additional trait to include in the broad definition of animal personality. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.","Bubo bubo; Animal movement; Between-individual variation; Individual consistency; Long-lived species; Repeatability","behavioral response; environmental conditions; environmental effect; home range; individual variation; locomotion; longevity; raptor; territory; Animalia; Bubo bubo; Strigiformes","Campioni, L.Rua Jardim do Tabaco 34, Portugal; email: etiziacampioni@hotmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09528369,,JOZOE,,"English","J.

Urbanized areas possess a range of novel stressors such as increased human disturbance, different suites of predators, new food types and altered habitats and complexity. Species may need to adjust aspects of their behaviour to cope with these novel stressors and persist in areas following urbanization. Sydney, Australia's largest city, has undergone rapid population and geographic expansion over two centuries, but remains a mosaic of natural and heavily urbanized habitats. We adopted a behavioural syndrome approach to investigate whether urbanization has influenced the behaviour of the delicate skink Lampropholis delicata in the Sydney region. Lizards from one of the urban populations were more active, and more likely to forage for food, than individuals from the other three populations, but there was no difference in activity or foraging behaviour between urban and non-urban populations overall. Skinks from urban and non-urban habitats did not differ in their exploratory or basking behaviours. Activity, exploratory behaviour and foraging behaviour were all repeatable, and a behavioural syndrome linking high activity with increased exploration was evident. Our study documents the impact of urbanization on an understudied taxonomic group in the Southern Hemisphere, where urbanization has occurred relatively recently, and suggests that the influence on behaviour might be related to the degree of urbanization that has occurred. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.","Activity; Basking site selection; Behavioural syndromes; Exploratory behaviour; Lizard; Urbanization","activity pattern; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; foraging behavior; human activity; lizard; site selection; taxonomy; urban population; urbanization; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Lampropholis delicata; Scincidae; Squamata","Chapple, D.G.; School of Biological Sciences, Monash UniversityAustralia; email: David.Chapple@monash.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09528369,,JOZOE,,"English","J.

In order to investigate how inter-school differences in risk behaviours can be explained by a positive school environment, measured via school bonding at the individual and school level, and how risk behaviour differences relate to a negative family environment, a multilevel analysis of individual, family and school factors was conducted. A survey was carried out with a random sample of 20 % of all students from 30 secondary schools in Croatia. The questionnaire used consisted of scales for assessing (1) risk behaviours, (2) socio-demographics, (3) adverse family relations, (4) school bonding and (5) school level variables. Intraclass correlations of 0.094 and 0.101 for risk behaviours and school bonding, respectively, were found. Upon fitting a multilevel model with individual and contextual variables, 94.3 % of the school level variance for risk behaviours was explained. Results indicate that, when the compositional effects of age, gender, family background and student’s own level of school attachment and commitment were held constant, attending a school where students tended to exhibit better school bonding was associated with fewer reported risk behaviours both for students from high and low levels of adverse family relationships. These findings support the notion that a whole school approach targeted towards students, families and schools may be helpful in the prevention of risk behaviours. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adverse family relations; Multilevel analysis; Risk behaviours; School bonding; School context",,"Rovis, D.; Teaching Institute for Public Health of Primorsko-Goranska County, Kresimirova 52A, Croatia; email: darko.rovis@zzjzpgz.hr",,"Springer New York LLC",10621024,,,,"English","J.

Deliberate introductions of non-native species offer opportunities to investigate how such genes differ between native and introduced populations and how polymorphisms in the genes are related to variation in behaviour. Here, we compared the genetic variation of the two 'personality' genes, DRD4 and SERT, between a native (United Kingdom, UK) and an introduced (New Zealand, NZ) population of dunnocks, Prunella modularis. The NZ population showed a significantly lower number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the UK population. Standardized F'st estimates of the personality genes and neutral microsatellites indicate that selection (anthropogenic and natural) probably occurred during and post the introduction event. Notably, the largest genetic differentiation was found in the intronic regions of the genes. In the NZ population, we also examined the association between polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT and two highly repeatable behavioural traits: flight-initiation distance and mating status (promiscuous females and cobreeding males). We found 38 significant associations (for different allele effect models) between the two behavioural traits and the studied genes. Further, 22 of the tested associations showed antagonistic allele effects for males and females. Our findings illustrate how introduction events and accompanying ecological changes could influence the genetic diversity of behaviour-related genes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","animal personality; boldness; dopamine receptor D4; introduced population; serotonin transporter; sex differences","dopamine 4 receptor; microsatellite DNA; serotonin transporter; allele; animal; animal behavior; biological model; DNA sequence; female; flying; genetics; Great Britain; haplotype; indel mutation; introduced species; male; New Zealand; Passeriformes; personality; phenotype; sex difference; sexual behavior; single nucleotide polymorphism; Alleles; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Flight, Animal; Great Britain; Haplotypes; INDEL Mutation; Introduced Species; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; New Zealand; Passeriformes; Personality; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Dopamine D4; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Holtmann, B.; Department of Zoology, University of Otago, 340 Great King Street, New Zealand; email: benedikt.holtmann@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09621083,,MOECE,"26669286","English","Mol.

However, little attention has been paid to possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial. These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role of social carryover effects. © 2015 The Authors.","Animal personality; Boldness; Consistency; Housing; Isolation; Repeatability; Three-spined stickleback","coastal water; experimental study; freshwater environment; individual variation; social behavior; teleost; Animalia; Gasterosteus aculeatus","Jolles, J.W.; Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, United Kingdom; email: j.w.jolles@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Being inverted is challenging and stressful for animals, as the position leaves them vulnerable to predators and desiccation. Although sea star self-righting was first studied in the 19th century, efforts to quantify patterns of within-individual consistency and among-individual differences are limited. Here we examined the performance and repeatability of righting behaviour in the Caribbean sea star (Oreaster reticulatus). Oreaster reticulatus were wild caught and transported to a nearby facility where they were inverted up to five times. Most animals improved their righting times and exhibited within-individual consistency and among individual differences in righting method. We posit that it may be favourable to employ a consistent righting method to effectively achieve an upright position. Predation pressure and stress physiology are hypothesized to shape individual differences in righting behaviour. Moreover, these results provide preliminary evidence of personality in sea stars. © 2016 Copyright 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","invertebrate behaviour; personality; self-righting; starfish; stress physiology",,"Gutowsky, L.F.G.; Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory, Department of Biology, Carleton UniversityCanada; email: lee.gutowsky@carleton.ca",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993965202

In addition to active 'fight-flight' defence responses, a passive 'freeze-hide' response is adaptive in some contexts. However, the physiological mechanisms determining which individuals choose a given defence response remain poorly understood. We examined the relationships among personality, metabolic performance and physiological stress responses across an environmental gradient in the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. We employed four behavioural assays to document the existence of two distinct behavioural types ('bold' and 'shy') in this species. We found consistent metabolic differences between individuals of a given behavioural type across an environmental gradient: shy individuals had overall lower aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and standard metabolic rate than bold individuals in both high (25 ppt) and low (3 ppt) salinity. These behavioural and metabolic differences translated into divergent physiological responses during acute stress: shy individuals adopted a passive 'freeze-hide' response by reducing their oxygen consumption rates (akin to shallow breathing) whereas bold individuals adopted an active 'fight-flight' response by increasing their rates of respiration. These distinct defence strategies were repeatable within individuals between salinity treatments. Although it has been suggested theoretically, this is the first empirical evidence that the metabolic response to stressful situations differs between bold and shy individuals. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating physiological measures to understand the mechanisms driving persistent inter-individual differences in animals. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Acute stress; Behavioural syndrome; Coping style; Intraspecific variation; Japanese flounder; Respirometry; Temperament","behavioral response; bioassay; environmental gradient; environmental stress; flatfish; intraspecific variation; oxygen consumption; phenotype; physiological response; salinity; temperature effect; aerobic metabolism; aggression; animal; animal behavior; basal metabolic rate; flounder; metabolism; personality; physiological stress; physiology; Aerobiosis; Aggression; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Behavior, Animal; Flounder; Personality; Stress, Physiological; Animalia; Paralichthys olivaceus; Pleuronectiformes","Lu, W.email: wqlv@shou.edu.cn",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00218790,,JAECA,"27044558","English","J.

Recently, it has been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result, certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications - from the way we conduct ecological research to the management and conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable? Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing) in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5 behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of animals to novelty. © 2015 The Author 2015.

Genes are expected to contribute to repeatable between-individual differences in sleep behaviors, which may be associated with individual fitness. We identified and genotyped polymorphisms in nine candidate genes for sleep, and measured five repeatable sleep behaviors in free-living great tits (Parus major), partly replicating a previous study in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Microsatellites in the CLOCK and NPAS2 clock genes exhibited an association with sleep duration relative to night length, and morning latency to exit the nest box, respectively. Furthermore, microsatellites in the NPSR1 and PCSK2 genes associated with relative sleep duration and proportion of time spent awake at night, respectively. Given the detection rate of associations in the same models run with random markers instead of candidate genes, we expected two associations to arise by chance. The detection of four associations between candidate genes and sleep, however, suggests that clock genes, a clock-related gene, or a gene involved in the melanocortin system, could play key roles in maintaining phenotypic variation in sleep behavior in avian populations. Knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying sleep behavior in the wild is important because it will enable ecologists to assess the evolution of sleep in response to selection. © 2016 Stuber et al.","Candidate gene; Circadian rhythm; Genotype-phenotype association; Repeatability; Sleep","melanocortin; microsatellite DNA; AANAT gene; ADCYAP1 gene; allele; animal experiment; Article; CACNA1c gene; CLOCK gene; controlled study; CREB1 gene; gene; gene frequency; genetic correlation; genetic polymorphism; genotype; genotype phenotype correlation; GRIA3 gene; heterozygosity; microsatellite marker; night; nonhuman; NPAS2 clock gene; NPSR1 gene; Parus major; PCSK2 gene; phenotypic variation; population structure; sleep; sleep time; wakefulness; animal; animal behavior; circadian rhythm; genetic association study; genetics; Passeriformes; phenotype; population genetics; sleep; Alleles; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Circadian Rhythm; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Microsatellite Repeats; Passeriformes; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Sleep","Stuber, E.F.; University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 509 Hardin Hall, United States; email: efstuber@gmail.com",,"Genetics Society of America",21601836,,,"26739645","English","G3 Genes Genome Genet.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959490866

CIDs are individual differences in phenotype that are maintained over time (e.g. as measured by repeatability) and across contexts. Many previous studies showed that there is a potential link between standard metabolic rate (SMR) and other physiological traits, and animal personality exists in a diverse array of animal taxa. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the SMR and metabolic characteristics after exhaustive exercise, and behavior, as well as the individual differences in these phenotypes in the juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus), a widely distributed and medium-sized Cyprinid species. To fulfill our aim, the SMR of 80 fish individuals was first measured at (25.0±0.5)℃, after which 40 individuals out of the total were selected to serve as the experimental fish. These 40 fish included 20 higher-SMR individuals and 20 lower-SMR individuals. Secondly, after chasing individual fish until they reached the point of exercise exhaustion within 5 min, the maximum aerobic metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope (AS=MMR-SMR), factorial aerobic scope (FAS=MMR/SMR), and magnitude of EPOC of each individual were examined during a 30 min period of metabolism recovery. Thirdly, the response time (RT), maximum linear speed (Umax), maximum linear acceleration speed (Amax), and distance travelled in 120 ms (S120) during a fast-start escape response were measured. Lastly, indicators of animal personality, including boldness and activity were also studied in each of the 40 individuals. This study demonstrated that the SMR of the experimental fish correlated negatively and the MMR correlated positively with AS, FAS, and the magnitude of EPOC. Individuals with high SMRs exhibited the same recovery rate as those individuals with smaller SMRs. The SMR of the experimental fish correlated negatively with Amax but correlated positively with RT. Neither Umax nor S120 showed any relationship with SMR. Correlations within components of the fast-start response found that Umax was positively correlated with the Amax and S120, while RT was negatively correlated with Umax, Amax, and S120, among the individual fish. Neither boldness (as indicated by latency, exposed time, and appearance frequency) nor activity (as indicated by percent time spent moving and frequency of hit wall) showed any correlation with SMR in the juvenile crucian carp; however the percent time spent moving correlated positively with exposed time and frequency of hit wall. This study suggests that the juvenile crucian carp raised under laboratory conditions exhibit remarkably CIDs in metabolism, the fast-start response, and personality. Trade-offs exist among these phenotypic traits, as the adaptive and ecological consequences were the result of the interaction of physiology, behavior, and the species' natural environment. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

We tested this idea by examining the repeatability and cross-context consistency of aggressive behaviours associated with foraging and mating in the raft spider, Dolomedes fimbriatus, in which some, highly voracious females reportedly kill approaching males and thus remain unmated. We failed to find support for a maladaptive spillover of voracious female personality. While females exhibited consistent interindividual differences in voracity towards prey, voracity did not correlate with female aggressiveness towards males. Instead, we show that female D. fimbriatus adjusted their tendency to attack courting males according to their size relative to the male. Females commonly attacked males during or after copulation, but sexual cannibalism depended on relative mate size difference, with mating success tending to be compromised in females with lower body weight. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggressive spillover; Mate size difference; Mating; Personality; Sexual cannibalism; Voracity","aggression; body mass; cannibalism; copulation; foraging behavior; mate choice; mating success; sexual dimorphism; spider; weight; Araneae; Dolomedes","Kralj-Fišer, S.; Evolutionary Zoology Laboratory, Biological Institute ZRC SAZU, Novi trg 2, Slovenia; email: simonakf@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

These stable differences are usually termed 'animal personality'. Parasitism is known to significantly influence the evolution of animal personality at least in part because more explorative individuals may meet parasites more frequently than less explorative ones. Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and exploration) were repeatable. Furthermore, firebugs with a stronger immune response behaved more boldly but also less actively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Firebug; Immune response; Parasitism; Personality","behavioral response; ectoparasite; immune response; infectivity; insect; mite; parasitism; wild population; animal behavior; Article; controlled study; encapsulation; exploratory behavior; female; Hemipteroseius adleri; immune response; immunity; male; mite; nonhuman; parasitism; personality; personality test; Pyrrhocoris apterus; sex difference; animal; animal behavior; ectoparasitosis; Heteroptera; host parasite interaction; mite; parasitology; personality; physiology; Acari; Animalia; Hemipteroseius; Pyrrhocoris apterus; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ectoparasitic Infestations; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Heteroptera; Host-Parasite Interactions; Male; Mites; Personality","Gyuris, E.; MTA-DE Lendület Behavioural Ecology Research Group, Department of Evolutionary Zoology, University of Debrecen, Egyetem tér 1, Hungary; email: eniko.gyuris@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03766357,,BPROD,"26569455","English","Behav.

However, much research to date has focused on moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, and in particular dynamic work, with the effect of low-intensity isometric exercise (<4 METs) on substrate utilization yet to be explored. Here we investigate the effects of such exercise on respiratory quotient (RQ) and determine the extent of intra- and inter-individual variability in response. Energy expenditure, RQ, and substrate oxidation were measured by ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry at rest and in response to standardized, intermittent, low-level isometric leg-press exercises at 5 loads (+5, +10, +15, +20, +25 kg) in 26 healthy, young adults. Nine participants repeated the experiment on 3 separate days to assess within-subject, between-day variability. There was no significant difference in energy cost and heart rate responses to low-intensity isometric exercise (<2 METs) between men and women. However, a sex difference was apparent in terms of substrate oxidation – with men increasing both fat and carbohydrate oxidation, and women only increasing fat oxidation while maintaining carbohydrate oxidation at baseline, resting levels. This sex difference was repeatable and persisted when substrate oxidation was adjusted for differences in body weight or body composition. Individual variability in RQ was relatively low, with both intra- and inter-individual coefficients of variation in the range of 3%–6% in both sexes. These results suggest that women preferentially increase fat oxidation during low-level isometric exercise. Whether such physical activity could be incorporated into treatment/prevention strategies aimed at optimizing fat oxidation in women warrants further investigation. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

These ""opponent - or indirect - effects are often repeatable, for example, certain opponents consistently elicit more or less aggressiveness in others. ""Personality"" (repeatable among-individual variation in behavior) has been proposed as an important source of indirect effects. Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity, exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects. Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology and evolution of behavior. © 2016 The Author.","Aggression; animal personality; behavioral syndrome; crickets; indirect effects; social behavior","aggression; behavioral response; conspecific; cricket; natural enemy; phenotype; social behavior; Animalia; Gryllidae; Gryllinae; Gryllus campestris","Santostefano, F.; Research Group Evolutionary Ecology of Variation, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Eberhard-Gwinner-Str., Germany; email: fsantostefano@orn.mpg.de",,"Oxford University Press",10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

The possible causes of this decline include habitat fragmentation factors such as dams and weirs. In some cases, these obstacles are equipped with fish friendly passage devices that may select young eels according to their climbing behaviour. We tested how individual climbing tendency was related to the event of fishway passage experienced in the field and classified fish climbing profiles as climbing ‘leaders’, ‘followers’, ‘finishers’ and ‘no climbers’. Moreover, we analysed the brain transcription level of genes related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and compared it to climbing profiles. We found that fish from the upstream segments of an impounded river had a higher climbing propensity. Their behaviour was also more repeatable throughout the whole test than the obstacle-naive fish from the downstream segment. Moreover, we found that boldly climbing ‘leaders’ had lower levels of transcription of synapse-related genes than the climbing ‘followers’. These differences could be related to coping styles of fish, where proactive ‘leaders’ express a routine and risky behaviour, whereas reactive fish need an environmental assessment before exploratory behaviour. Our study showed that differences in climbing propensity exist in glass eels separated by water obstacles. Moreover, eels could adopt climbing different strategies according to the way they deal with environmental stress and to the cognitive abilities they possess. © 2016 The Authors.","Behaviour; Brain; Cognition; Dams; Eel",,"Podgorniak, T.; Irstea Bordeaux, UR EABX, HYNES (Irstea—EDF RandD), 50 Avenue de Verdun, France; email: tomasz_podgorniak@hotmail.fr",,"Royal Society",20545703,,,,"English","R.

Almost all of this work has been done in the context of evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability) and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia, flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural traits. © The Author 2016.","Environmental effects; Intraclass correlation; Personality; Phenotypic plasticity; Reaction norm; Temperature",,"Killen, S.S.; Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Graham Kerr Building, United Kingdom; email: shaun.killen@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Oxford University Press",20511434,,,,"English","Conserv.

This study is the first attempt to examine the longitudinal relationship between study addiction and work addiction. Methods: The Bergen Study Addiction Scale (BStAS), the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS), and the Ten-Item Personality Inventory were administered online together with questions concerning demographics and study-related variables in two waves. In Wave 1, a total of 2,559 students in Norway and 2,177 students in Poland participated. A year later, in Wave 2, 379 Norwegians and 401 Polish who began to work professionally completed the survey. Results: The intraclass correlation between BStAS and BWAS revealed that the scores were somewhat related; however, the relationship was slightly weaker than the temporal stability of both constructs. In the Norwegian sample, scoring higher on neuroticism and lower on learning time outside educational classes in Wave 1 was positively related to work addiction in Wave 2, whereas gender was unrelated to work addiction in Wave 2 when controlling for other studied variables in either samples. Conclusion: Study addiction and work addiction appear to be closely related suggesting that the former may be a precursor for (or an early form of) the latter. © 2016 The Author(s).","Longitudinal study; Personality; Study addiction; Work addiction; Workaholism","addiction; adult; Article; behavior disorder assessment; Bergen study addiction scale; Bergen work addiction scale; female; human; learning; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neurosis; Norway; Norwegian (people); personality test; Poland; Polish citizen; rating scale; scoring system; student; work addiction; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Addictive; comparative study; cultural factor; psychological rating scale; psychology; regression analysis; sex difference; statistics and numerical data; time factor; work; young adult; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Humans; Learning; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Norway; Personality Inventory; Poland; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Regression Analysis; Sex Factors; Students; Time Factors; Work; Young Adult","Atroszko, P.A.; Institute of Psychology, University of Gdansk, Bazyńskiego 4, Poland; email: p.atroszko@ug.edu.pl",,"Akademiai Kiado Rt.",20625871,,,"27842448","English","J.

Sleep reactivity has been termed a ""trait-like"" vulnerability; however, evidence of its long-term stability is lacking. The main objective of the current psychometric study was to investigate the temporal stability of the FIRST over two 6-mo intervals in a populationbased sample of adults with and without insomnia. The temporal stability of the FIRST was also compared with the temporal stability of other scales associated with insomnia (trait-anxiety, arousability). Methods: Participants included 1,122 adults (mean age = 49.9 y, standard deviation = 14.8; 38.8% male) presenting with an insomnia syndrome (n = 159), insomnia symptoms (n = 152), or good sleep (n = 811). Participants completed the FIRST, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait-anxiety), and the Arousal Predisposition Scale (arousability) on three different occasions: baseline and at 6- and 12-mo follow-up. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed for all scales (baseline to 6 mo and 6 to 12 mo). Results: The FIRST yielded strong temporal stability from baseline to 6 mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.81), symptoms (ICC = 0.78), and good sleep (ICC = 0.81). Similar results were observed for 6 to 12 mo among those with insomnia syndrome (ICC = 0.74), insomnia symptoms (ICC = 0.82), and good sleep (ICC = 0.84). The stability of the FIRST was not comparable with the stability of trait-anxiety, but was somewhat comparable with the stability of arousability. Conclusions: Overall, the FIRST is a temporally reliable stable scale over 6-mo intervals. Future research is needed to corroborate the stability and trait-like measures of sleep reactivity with physiological, behavioural and personality measures.","Insomnia; Psychometrics; Reliability; Sleep reactivity; Temporal stability","adult; arousal; Article; behavior; clinical assessment tool; confidence interval; controlled study; correlation coefficient; exercise test; female; ford insomnia response to stress test; human; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; middle aged; personality; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; psychometry; self report; sleep quality; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stress; coping behavior; follow up; insomnia; mental stress; psychology; questionnaire; self report; standards; time; Adaptation, Psychological; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Self Report; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time","Morin, C.M.; École de Psychologie, Université Laval, 2325, rue des Bibliothèques, Canada; email: cmorin@psy.ulaval.ca",,"American Academy of Sleep Medicine",15509389,,,"27568895","English","J.

Individuals that differ consistently in their behaviours from others of the same population are considered to exhibit different personalities. Personality can be easily quantified with repeat tests on animals held in captivity. However, captive-based tests may not always be possible for logistical reasons and tests conducted in captivity can alter naturally occurring behaviours. Development of methods to assess personality in the field over short-term capture is an important alternative to long-term captive tests. Aims To develop and refine field-based tests that can be used to easily define personality traits of wild common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), eliminating the need to bring individuals into captivity for an extended period of time. Methods We developed a series of short-term capture protocols to quantify personality traits of the common brushtail possum in the field, using handling-bag tests, modified open-field tests, trap-behaviour tests and release tests. Key results Personality traits of brushtail possums could be measured in several different ways, but refining methods was crucial to reveal traits efficiently. Behaviours related to several personality traits (boldness, docility and activity/exploration) could be measured rapidly in the field with our methods, and were repeatable over time. Conclusions Rapid, reliable and easy-to-perform quantification of personality of brushtail possums in the field is possible. This may sometimes be the only available option, and has advantages over long captive trials in terms of animal welfare and cost. Implications The present study provides a baseline for future research on the personality of common brushtail possums and its application to management and control strategies for the species. © The authors 2016.","activity; boldness; docility; exploration","animal welfare; captivity; marsupial; nature conservation; numerical method; research work; testing method; Animalia; Phalangeridae; Trichosurus vulpecula","Mella, V.S.A.; School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Heydon Laurence Building A08, University of SydneyAustralia; email: valentina.mella@sydney.edu.au",,"CSIRO",10353712,,WRESE,,"English","Wildl.

These skills must be acquired beforehand and retained through the mission lifetime, which is commonly done today through staged simulation campaigns. They provide a successful way to train operators and maintain the team knowledge; however they requisition many key personnel and so are particularly costly. This is due to a number of limitations. In the first part of this paper, we will describe these limitations. First, the training scenarios can only be manually orchestrated, usually by a simulation officer and his team controlling the simulator, following a procedure and injecting system failures or specific requests during the campaign. Second, because the simulation campaigns have to be as realistic as possible, all operators must be present in the control centre, making it impossible for trainees to practice off-line, on their own. Finally, only systems are simulated (spacecraft, ground stations, etc.); yet, just as the systems they work with, human operators can fail. They can also make mistakes and they are driven by their personal behaviour and personality. Within today's simulation campaigns, these aspects are neither repeatable nor controllable. Our work in CGI in Darmstadt, Germany, focuses on the ground systems and the operations of space missions, for both public actors like ESA/ESOC and commercial organisations. To overcome some of the limitations in operator training, CGI decided to create MATES. The second part of the paper will present this new tool, its features and the status of its development. MATES will provide a scenario planning tool for the simulation officer, a scenario library and a scenario execution engine, giving the possibility to pre-configure any kind of scenario and to run it autonomously: independently of any simulation or the availability of a simulation officer. MATES will also introduce virtual operators, and automate their behaviour as part of the scenario execution, using proven concepts and technologies such as the Belief-Desire-Intention model and the AgentSpeak language, which allow the computational representation of human behaviour. Finally, the last part of the paper will give an overview of its benefits. With MATES, virtual training simulations can complement real training simulations, allowing operators to engage in custom simulations at any time of their choosing. Virtual scenarios can easily be repeated, which can support the operator certification process. To summarise, MATES will offer hands-on practice beside classical 'large-scale' simulation campaigns, improving the operational training and reduce its cost.

Some 14054 records of maternal behaviour score (MBS, 1 ≤ good, 5 ≤ poor) were collected at lamb tagging from 32 breeds of sheep over several years in a variety of environments. Records for two objectively scored temperament traits, flight time from a weighing crate (FT) and agitation score in an isolation box test (IBT) were available on 19151 and 17159 animals, respectively. These data were pooled from three sources, which included research and commercial ram breeding flocks. The combined data were also split into three subsets based on breed groups (Merino, Maternal and Terminal) for analyses. Records of weights and number of lambs weaned (NLW), as well as pedigree information was available from the national genetic evaluation database. The heritability estimates from the combined analyses were 0.20 ± 0.02 for MBS, 0.18 ± 0.02 for FT and 0.26 ± 0.02 for IBT, with a repeatability of 0.24 ± 0.01 for MBS. There were some small differences between the breed groups in the heritability estimates. The genetic correlations between FT and MBS were negative (favourable) and consistent across the datasets (-0.47 ± 0.12, combined analysis). The genetic correlations between IBT and MBS were positive (favourable) but not significant (0.12 ± 0.11, combined analysis). The genetic correlations between IBT and FT were also favourable, but small and generally not significant. There were small favourable genetic correlations between MBS and various bodyweights (-0.17 ± 0.07, yearling) and NLW (-0.25 ± 0.07). However, there were no significant genetic relationships between the temperament and production traits. The moderate heritability and repeatability of MBS indicate maternal behaviour could be improved by selection, and that it could be a useful additional trait in breeding programs for improved reproduction. © CSIRO 2016.","lamb production; maternal behaviour; sheep; temperament","behavioral response; body mass; female behavior; genetic analysis; group behavior; heritability; selective breeding; sheep; survival; tagging; Animalia; Ovis aries","Fogarty, N.M.; Animal Genetics and Breeding Unit, University of New EnglandAustralia; email: neal.fogarty@dpi.nsw.gov.au",,"CSIRO",18360939,,,,"English","Ani.

But are larger individuals bolder? We assessed this question by measuring time to emerge from a shelter in repeated trials on hatchling keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii). Estimates of repeatability of emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions. Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as well as morphology. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.","Behavioural assay; Natricine; Risk aversion; Shelter emergence",,"Brown, G.P.; School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Heydon-Laurence Building A08, University of SydneyAustralia; email: gregory.brown@sydney.edu.au",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962438794

Urban animals are often less wary of humans than their non-urban counterparts, which could be explained by habituation, adaptation or local site selection. Under local site selection, individuals that are less tolerant of humans are less likely to settle in urban areas. However, there is little evidence for such temperament-based site selection, and even less is known about its underlying genetic basis. We tested whether site selection in urban and non-urban habitats by black swans (Cygnus atratus) was associated with polymorphisms in two genes linked to fear in animals, the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and serotonin transporter (SERT) genes. Results: Wariness in swans was highly repeatable between disturbance events (repeatability = 0.61) and non-urban swans initiated escape from humans earlier than urban swans. We found no inter-individual variation in the SERT gene, but identified five DRD4 genotypes and an association between DRD4 genotype and wariness. Individuals possessing the most common DRD4 genotype were less wary than individuals possessing rarer genotypes. As predicted by the local site selection hypothesis, genotypes associated with wary behaviour were over three times more frequent at the non-urban site. This resulted in moderate population differentiation at DRD4 (FST = 0.080), despite the sites being separated by only 30 km, a short distance for this highly-mobile species. Low population differentiation at neutrally-selected microsatellite loci and the likely occasional migration of swans between the populations reduces the likelihood of local site adaptations. Conclusion: Our results suggest that wariness in swans is partly genetically-determined and that wary swans settle in less-disturbed areas. More generally, our findings suggest that site-specific management strategies may be necessary that consider the temperament of local animals. © 2015 van Dongen et al.","Black swan; DRD4; Flight initiation distance; Habitat selection; SERT; Urbanisation","adaptation; flight activity; flight behavior; gene expression; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; genotype; polymorphism; site selection; urbanization; waterfowl; Animalia; Cygnus; Cygnus atratus; avian protein; dopamine 4 receptor; amino acid sequence; animal; chemistry; escape behavior; genetic polymorphism; genetics; human activities; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; physiology; sequence alignment; waterfowl; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anseriformes; Avian Proteins; Base Sequence; Escape Reaction; Human Activities; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymorphism, Genetic; Receptors, Dopamine D4; Sequence Alignment","Van Dongen, W.F.D.; Applied Ecology Research Group, Institute for Sustainability and Innovation, College of Engineering and Science, Victoria University-Footscray Park Campus, PO Box 14428, Australia; email: wouter.v.dongen@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712148,,,"26653173","English","BMC Evol.

For instance, direct environmental effects during ontogeny (phenotypic plasticity) as the proximate mechanism behind the emergence of consistent individual differences in behavior are usually overlooked compared to environmental effects operating across generations (genetic adaptation). Here, we tested the effects of sociality and perceived predation risk during ontogeny on the strength of behavioral consistency in agile frog (Rana dalmatina) tadpoles in a factorial common garden experiment. Tadpoles reared alone and without predatory cues showed zero repeatability within (i.e., lack of personality) and zero correlation between (i.e., lack of syndrome) activity and risk-taking. On the other hand, cues from predators alone induced both activity and risk-taking personalities, while cues from predators and conspecifics together resulted in an activity - risk-taking behavioral syndrome. Our results show that individual experience has an unequivocal role in the emergence of behavioral consistency. In this particular case, the development of behavioral consistency was most likely the result of genotype × environment interactions, or with other words, individual variation in behavioral plasticity. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Animal personality; Behavioral syndrome; Environment; Evolution; Plasticity",,"Urszán, T.J.; Behavioural Ecology Group, Department of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, Eötvös Loránd University, Pazmany Péter sétány, 1/c, Hungary; email: reconciliator@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",20457758,,,,"English","Ecology and Evolution",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956821344

Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acheta domesticus; Behavioural syndrome; Fitness trade-off; House cricket; Pace-of-life hypothesis; Personality; Phenotypic modularity; Trait covariance","behavioral response; body mass; covariance analysis; empirical analysis; fitness; hypothesis testing; individual variation; life history trait; metabolism; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; Acheta domesticus; Gryllidae; Orthoptera","Dochtermann, N.A.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State UniversityUnited States",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We conducted experiments to determine whether checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may underlie the behaviours and performance tested. © 2015.","Coping; Cortisol; Movement; Sphoeroides testudineus; Swimming performance","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; psychotropic agent; animal behavior; Article; controlled study; exhaustion; hydrocortisone blood level; locomotion; nonhuman; personality; physiological stress; predation; priority journal; puffer fish; startle reflex; stress; swimming; adaptive behavior; animal; animal housing; Bahamas; drug effects; environment; mental stress; motor activity; pathophysiology; personality; physiology; psychology; survival analysis; swimming; Tetraodontiformes; validation study; wild animal; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Animals, Wild; Bahamas; Environment; Housing, Animal; Hydrocortisone; Motor Activity; Personality; Psychotropic Drugs; Stress, Psychological; Survival Analysis; Swimming; Tetraodontiformes","Pleizier, N.; Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory, Department of Biology and Institute of Environmental Science, Carleton University, 1125 Colonel By Dr., Canada; email: naomipleizier@cmail.carleton.ca",,"Elsevier Inc.",00319384,,PHBHA,"26375573","English","Physiol.

Individual consistency in behavioural responses to challenge has been documented across the animal kingdom. Comparatively few studies, however, have examined inter-individual variation in the physiological response, namely glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels, the stress hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively. Variation in coping styles between individuals may be explained in part by differences in social rank and sex. Using 20 Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrofa) we: (1) investigated the existence of consistent inter-individual variation in exploratory behaviour and the hormonal stress response, and tested for correlations as predicted by the coping styles hypothesis; and (2) evaluated whether inter-individual behavioural and hormonal variation is related to social rank and sex. Salivary stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase, chromogranin A) were assessed in the presence and absence of a stressor consisting of social isolation in a crate for 10 min. Principal components analysis on a set of behavioural variables revealed two traits, which we labelled exploratory tendency and neophobia. Neither exploratory tendency nor neophobia predicted the physiological stress response. Subordinate pigs exhibited higher catecholamine levels compared to dominant conspecifics. We observed sex differences in the repeatability of salivary stress markers and reactivity of the stress systems. The results do not provide support for the existence of behavioural-physiological coping styles in pigs.

One way to understand the evolution of such a group-level phenomenon is to compare horizontally patterns of correlations among populations (or species) or follow longitudinally the same population over years in the light of parallel differences in the environment. We applied the longitudinal approach to 8-year field data and analyzed phenotypic correlations, and their within- and between-individual components, among three behaviors (novelty avoidance, aggression, and risk-taking) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, in a meta-analytic framework. The phenotypic correlation between novelty avoidance and aggression varied heterogeneously (it was positive in some years, while it was negative in other years), while the other pair-wise correlations were consistently positive over the study period. We investigated four potential socio-ecological factors, and found evidence that the among-year alterations in the demographic structure of the population (density, age composition) can be responsible for the heterogeneous effect sizes. Comparing within- and between-individual correlations across pairs of traits, we found that the correlation between aggression and risk-taking at the among-individual level was the strongest suggesting that this relationship has the highest potential to form a behavioral syndrome. Within-year repeatabilities varied among traits, but were systematically higher than between-year repeatabilities. Our study highlights on an empirical basis that there can be several biological and statistical reasons behind detecting a phenotypic correlation in a study, but only few of these imply that fixed behavioral syndromes are maintained in a natural population. In fact, some correlations seem to be shaped by environmental fluctuations. © 2015, The Author(s).","Boldness; Effect size; Flight initiation distance; Personality; Phenotypic correlation; Temperament","aggression; avoidance reaction; behavioral ecology; correlation; flight activity; individual variation; interspecific variation; male behavior; meta-analysis; passerine; phenotype; population structure; Ficedula albicollis","Garamszegi, L.Z.; Department of Evolutionary Ecology, Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC, c/Americo Vespucio s/n, Spain; email: laszlo.garamszegi@ebd.csic.es",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Salivary cortisol was sampled at four time points during the day (waking, 30-min post-waking, afternoon, and evening) across three days in a sample of 36 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 27 typically developing (TD) peers. Between-group comparisons on both mean levels and featural components of diurnal cortisol indicated elevated evening cortisol and a dampened linear decline across the day in the ASD group. No differences were evident on the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Group-based trajectory modeling indicated that a subgroup (25%) of ASD children demonstrated an attenuated linear decline while the cortisol trajectory of the second subgroup was indistinguishable from that of the TD group. Intraclass correlations indicated that, when aggregated across days, cortisol measures were generally stable over the interval assessed. There were few significant relations between cortisol measures or sub-groups and measures of stress, temperament, and symptoms.

Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30. min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural flexibility; Learning; Mallards; Maze; Personality","cognition; fitness; food availability; habituation; hormone; passerine; social behavior; Anas platyrhynchos; Animalia; Aves","Bousquet, C.A.H.; Evolutionary Ethology, Department of Ecology, Physiology and Ethology, IPHC - UMR 7178, CNRS-UDS, 23 rue Becquerel, France",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report here. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Capreolus capreolus; Capture; Individual differences; Mammal; Personality; Repeatability","age class; behavioral response; capture method; deer; individual variation; life history trait; sex-related difference; social behavior; wild population; Europe; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Mammalia","Vanpé, C.; Laboratoire Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive, UMR CNRS 5558, UCB Lyon 1, Bât.

Although older, experienced individuals often occupy keystone roles such as leader or dominant individual, few studies have performed manipulations to study their impact. Here, we investigate how juvenile collective foraging behaviour is influenced by adult presence in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. Our manipulation of age demography revealed that the presence of a few mature females drastically increased a groups' foraging aggressiveness, demonstrating that adults indeed act as keystone individuals in juvenile spider groups. Interestingly, the magnitude of their positive impact on collective foraging was mediated by group size: adult presence shortened latency to attack prey more strongly in large groups than in small groups. Conversely, adult presence increased the number of attackers only in small groups. Surprisingly, intergroup variation in collective foraging, which is known to be consistent in mature social spiders, was not repeatable in juvenile groups. Thus, juvenile groups seem to behave more erratically or need more time to develop collective personalities. Together, our results suggest that adult presence can have profound, catalytic effects on juvenile collective foraging behaviour, and that these effects are modulated by group size. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Age demography; Collective behaviour; Foraging; Group size; Keystone individual; Social spider","age structure; demographic survey; foraging behavior; group behavior; group size; keystone species; social insect; spider; Animalia; Araneae; Stegodyphus dumicola","Modlmeier, A.P.; University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biological Sciences, 4249 Fifth Avenue, United States",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here, we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals. Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their social-foraging associates. © 2015 The Authors.","Animal personality; Parus major; Repeatability; Social behaviour; Socixal network analysis","age; decision making; fitness; foraging behavior; individual variation; passerine; phenotype; population density; sex ratio; social behavior; social network; spatiotemporal analysis; wild population; Animalia; Parus major","Aplin, L.M.; Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Purposes: This study aimed (1) to re-establish the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers; (2) to evaluate the pain experience of adults with IDD by caregivers' proxy report; and (3) to assess the sensitivity of the Non-Communicating Adult Pain Checklist (NCAPC) as a pain scale for chronic pain (CP) in individuals with IDD. Method: Frothy-three caregivers, working for more than 3 years with adults with IDD, performed pain assessments of 187 individuals living in a residential facility. Two caregivers evaluated whether each resident suffers from pain and assessed the intensity, causes and duration of pain experience. Furthermore, 52/187 residents [26 with CP and 26 pain free (PF) based on medical record and caregiver reports] were evaluated by an additional seven caregivers using the NCAPC in order to establish the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers. Results: According to caregivers' report, 48% of adults with IDD suffer from pain at a mean level of 6/10, with more than 10% suffering from high levels of pain on a constant basis. Inter-rater agreement was found mostly high with intraclass correlation values ranging between 0.73 and 0.93. Using the NCAPC, we were able to identify CP and PF individuals with a significant score difference (P=0.003). Conclusions: The results support the use of the NCAPC as a scale to evaluate CP in adults with IDD. The findings reiterate the reliability of caregivers as proxy observers and the importance of involving them in identifying pain behaviours of their protégées. Our findings reiterate the need for an immediate action for appropriate pain management protocols for adult with IDD.

Methods: The data were collected from 363 general Japanese individuals aged 16–88 years living in Kumamoto prefecture. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire designed for this study with self-reported weight and height values. Measured weight and height were measured immediately after questionnaire completion. Paired t-tests identified differences between self-reported and measured values by sex. Multiple-stepwise regression analysis examined the independent variables’ effects on the differences between self-reported and measured weights. Results: Significant differences were found between self-reported and measured values for both sexes (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative relationship between the difference in an individual’s self-reported and measured weight in each sex, with higher measured weight individuals more likely to underestimate their weight. Multiple-stepwise regression analysis models explained 12.1 % (p < 0.01), 11.3 % (p < 0.01), and 5.6 % (p < 0.01) of the variance in all participants, men, and women, respectively. Significant effects were found for age, weight measurement frequency, and measured weight in total participants, weight measurement frequency, and measured weight for men, and age for women. Conclusions: In this study, the mean absolute value of the weight and height variances proved the unreliability of self-reported weight and height values. This study’s findings suggest self-reported weight inaccuracy especially for obese populations.

Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as 'breeders' and 'nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and 'escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. © 2015.","Banded mongoose; Cooperation; Repeatability; Reproduction; Social niche hypothesis","behavioral response; carnivore; cooperative behavior; felid; mate guarding; parental care; reintroduction; reproductive behavior; reproductive cost; social conflict; specialization; wild population; Animalia; Mungos mungo","Cant, M.A.; Centre of Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, United Kingdom",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

This practice produces a readily available clumped resource for many scavengers such as seabirds, but in the face of declining stocks and via policy change, the amount of discards produced is set to decline in the future. To understand how discards have influenced seabird foraging in the past and how birds may respond to future change requires studies examining consistent individual foraging choices. There is increasing evidence that populations may be made up of generalist or specialist foragers and this is key to the population's ability to adapt to change. Here we test for consistent individual foraging behaviour of northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to fishing vessels and examine consequences of scavenging behaviour in terms of foraging effort and body condition. Using a combination of bird-borne bio-logging devices (GPS and Time Depth Recorders) with high resolution GPS data acquired through vessel monitoring systems on fishing boats, we examined the overlap between birds and fisheries. We found that during repeat foraging trips in the same breeding season, gannets regularly foraged at fishing boats but there were also clear among individual differences in the extent of fisheries overlap. Furthermore, we show for the first time that these differences represent consistent strategies - individual differences in scavenging were highly repeatable across multiple trips within a period of several weeks. However, despite this finding, we found no differences in foraging effort or body condition between scavengers and non-scavengers. Moreover, scavenging strategy did not appear to influence diving behaviour or vary by sex. Scavenging on discards appears to be a strategy employed consistently by a subsection of the population and future work should examine whether these specialisations persist throughout and between years and what causes these individual differences, exploring possible demographic and fitness consequences in light of global changes to fish stocks and fisheries management. © 2015 Nordic Society Oikos.",,"body condition; demographic method; fishery discard; fitness; foraging behavior; GPS; prediction; scavenging (feeding); seabird; sex-related difference; Aves; Morus bassanus; Sulidae",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09088857,,JAVBE,,"English","J.

Three main hypotheses have been suggested to explain the evolution of behavioral syndromes. The constraint hypothesis suggests that behaviors originate from a shared mechanism with a strong genetic or physiological basis. In contrast, according to the adaptive hypothesis, behavioral syndromes depend on specific selective pressures in each environment, and thus should evolve when specific behavioral combinations are advantageous. Finally, behavioral syndromes can also arise owing to neutral stochastic processes. We tested here for variation in the foraging syndromes of pit-building antlions originating from different populations along a climatic gradient. Although inter-population variation existed in some traits, foraging syndromes were similar across populations, supporting the constraint hypothesis. These findings suggest that stabilizing selection, acting on the foraging behavior of antlions during their larval phase, outweighs local selection pressures, resulting in “constraint syndromes.” We also explored behavioral repeatability of foraging-related traits within and among habitats (natural, novel and disturbed habitats), and detected different levels of repeatability: pit diameter was more repeatable than response time to prey, followed by prey exploitation efficiency. Behavioral repeatability of the same trait differed according to context, suggesting that repeatability is a trait in itself and should not be considered identical even when studying the same behavioral trait. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioral syndrome; Climate gradient; Natural selection; Repeatability; Trap-building predators","adaptation; climate effect; environmental response; evolutionary biology; foraging behavior; habitat type; insect; interpopulation variation; larva; natural selection; prey selection; stochasticity; Myrmeleontidae; animal; ecosystem; environment; evolution; feeding behavior; genetic selection; insect; larva; phenotype; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Environment; Feeding Behavior; Insects; Larva; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic","Alcalay, Y.; Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the NegevIsrael",,"Springer Verlag",00298549,,OECOB,"25764505","English","Oecologia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937971653

Here we explore the possibility to integrate offspring separation (distress) calls into the study of consistent individual differences in behaviour in two species of mammals, the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) and the mound-building mouse (Mus spicilegus). Such vocal responses in young mammals are a potentially useful test option as they represent an important element of mother-offspring communication with strong implications for offspring survival. In addition, the neural control of vocalisation is closely associated with emotional state. Results: We found marked similarities in the pattern of individual responses of the young of both species to separation from their mother and littermates. In the domestic cat as well as in the mound-building mouse, individual differences in the frequency of calls and to a lesser extent in locomotor activity were repeatable across age, indicating the existence of personality types. Such consistencies across age were also apparent when only considering relative individual differences among litter siblings. In both species, however, individual patterns of vocalisation and locomotor activity were unrelated. This suggests that these two forms of behavioural responses to isolation represent different domains of personality, presumably based on different underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Conclusions: Brief separation experiments in young mammals, and particularly the measurement of separation calls, provide a promising approach to study the ontogeny of personality traits. Future long-term studies are needed to investigate the association of these traits with biologically meaningful and potentially repeatable elements of behaviour during later life. © 2015 Hudson et al.","Development; Felis silvestris catus; Locomotion; Mus spicilegus; Open field test; Personality; Siblings; Vocalization",,"Hudson, R.; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones BiomédicasMexico; email: rhudson@biomedicas.unam.mx",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17429994,,,,"English","Front.

Stable, repeatable traits imply reduced plasticity and this is particularly interesting in the case of behaviour, which is the most flexible trait of an animal in its interaction with the biotic and abiotic environment. While the importance of consistent individual differences has been widely acknowledged, the lifetime development of these differences and their potentially adaptive or maladaptive consequences for individuals only recently came into the focus of research [1,2]. As a result, widespread evidence for the existence of changes in behaviour and behavioural plasticity over the lifetime of individuals begins to accumulate [3]. This has raised novel questions concerning the overwhelming importance of ontogenetic and trans-generational influences on the development and fitness of behavioural phenotypes and the mechanisms influencing changes during an individual's lifetime. © 2015 Trillmich et al.",,,"Trillmich, F.; Bielefeld University, Animal Behaviour, Morgenbreede 45, Germany; email: fritz.trillmich@uni-bielefeld.de",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17429994,,,,"English","Front.

We performed such a longitudinal test across three life stages in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), representing about 15-20% of their life span in captivity, and found repeatabilities ranging from 0.03 to 0.67. Fearlessness and exploration were the most repeatable traits both within and across life stages. Activity and aggression were repeatable across, but not or only partly within life stages. Boldness was not repeatable. Furthermore, we found no evidence for a consistent behavioural syndrome structure across ontogeny.

The presence of age-related plasticity in behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of study in many systems. Empirical work aimed at understanding IxA and GxA in behavior is needed in order to understand whether patterns predicted by theory on plasticity indeed occur for age-related plasticity of behavior. © 2015 Brommer et al.","Animal personality; Behavior; Behavioral syndrome; Evolutionary quantitative genetics; G matrix; Heritability; Senescence",,"Brommer, J.E.; University Hill, 20014 University of Turku, Department of BiologyFinland; email: jon.brommer@utu.fi",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17429994,,,,"English","Front.

Such within-individual behavioral variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual's phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate on among-individual variation and present examples for how variation in corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness, and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to environments. In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm approaches might be a fruitful way forward. We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the functional implications and the evolution of hormone-behavior relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals. This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust hormonally-mediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions. © 2015 Hau et al.","Behavior; Corticosterone; Environmental gradient; Hormone; Quantitative relationship; Reaction norm; Testosterone",,"Hau, M.; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Eberhard-Gwinner-Str., Germany; email: mhau@orn.mpg.de",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17429994,,,,"English","Front.

Vulnerability to harvest varies among individuals within species according to behavioural phenotypes, but we lack fundamental information regarding the physiological mechanisms underlying harvest-induced selection. It is unknown, for example, what physiological traits make some individual fish more susceptible to capture by commercial fisheries. Active fishing methods such as trawling pursue fish during harvest attempts, causing fish to use both aerobic steady-state swimming and anaerobic burst-type swimming to evade capture. Using simulated trawling procedures with schools of wild minnows Phoxinus phoxinus, we investigate two key questions to the study of fisheries-induced evolution that have been impossible to address using large-scale trawls: (i) are some individuals within a fish shoal consistently more susceptible to capture by trawling than others?; and (ii) if so, is this related to individual differences in swimming performance and metabolism? Results provide the first evidence of repeatable variation in susceptibility to trawling that is strongly related to anaerobic capacity and swimming ability. Maximum aerobic swim speed was also negatively correlated with vulnerability to trawling. Standard metabolic rate was highest among fish that were least vulnerable to trawling, but this relationship probably arose through correlations with anaerobic capacity. These results indicate that vulnerability to trawling is linked to anaerobic swimming performance and metabolic demand, drawing parallels with factors influencing susceptibility to natural predators. Selection on these traits by fisheries could induce shifts in the fundamental physiological makeup and function of descendent populations. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

First, individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activitychamber) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activitymesocosm) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activitymesocosm and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activitychamber. After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activitymesocosm, supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves. We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional relationships between individual behavior and energetics. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Animal personality; Anti-predator; Behavioral type/syndrome; Boldness; Crassostrea virginica; Oyster reef","activity pattern; behavioral response; bioenergetics; chemical cue; conspecific; crab; environmental conditions; fish; functional morphology; life history trait; metabolism; mimicry; Animalia; Batrachoididae gen. sp.; Crassostrea virginica; Decapoda (Crustacea); Opsanus tau; Ostreidae; Panopeus herbstii","Toscano, B.J.; Department of BioSciences, Rice UniversityUnited States; email: benjamin.toscano@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

The first steps have been taken to characterize sleep in free-living birds, but it is unclear to what extent these results can be generalized between species. To describe sleep behaviour in the wild, we videorecorded great tits, Parus major, in their roosting boxes during two consecutive winters and individuals in captivity for comparison. Here, we examined endogenous and exogenous correlates of sleep behaviour in free-living great tits and addressed the potential confounding issues of studying avian sleep in captivity. Like that in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, sleep behaviour in great tits was strongly related to season, and was affected by sex, age and the environment. Although literature suggests relationships between sleep and risk-taking behaviours, possibly arising from stable differences in physiological state, sleep behaviour appeared to be plastic in great tits, and was not predicted by between-individual variation in exploratory tendencies. Captive tits initiated sleep later than wild individuals, even under natural photoperiodic conditions, suggesting that captivity alters timing and duration of sleep in great tits. Long-term repeatability in sleep behaviour was low for all variables, except morning latency (high repeatability) and evening box entry time, evening latency and frequency of awakenings (no detectable repeatability). Variation in sleep behaviour may largely represent within-individual differences in daily sleep requirements. Our study describes how different observable components of sleep are intercorrelated by providing evidence for significant within-individual correlations between sleep behaviours, which represent the integration of plasticity between traits. Consistent with low repeatability, low between-individual correlations suggest substantial behavioural plasticity in sleep, rather than a correlational structure leading to clear sleep 'syndromes'. Our study provides quantitative evidence for the factors producing phenotypic plasticity in behavioural sleep in an ecological context. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Exploration; Great tit; Repeatability; Sleep behaviour; Sleep timing; Ultradian rhythm","captivity; intraspecific variation; passerine; photoperiod; physiological response; sleep; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Cyanistes caeruleus; Parus major","Stuber, E.F.; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Eberhard-Gwinner-Straße, House 7, Germany",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

The current study examined the relationship between undifferentiated negative affect and impulsivity. Participants with a current BPD (n = 67) or depressive disorder (DD; n = 38) diagnosis carried an electronic diary for 28 days, reporting on emotions and impulsivity when randomly prompted (up to 6 times per day). Undifferentiated negative affect was quantified using momentary intraclass correlation coefficients, which indicated how consistently negative emotion items were rated across fear, hostility, and sadness subscales. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion-level, day-level, and across 28 days was used to predict occasion-level impulsivity. Multilevel modeling was used to test the hypothesis that undifferentiated negative emotion would be a significant predictor of momentary impulsivity above and beyond levels of overall negative affect. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion and day levels were significant predictors of occasion-level impulsivity, but undifferentiated negative affect across the 28-day study period was only marginally significant. Results did not differ depending on BPD or DD status, though individuals with BPD did report significantly greater momentary impulsivity and undifferentiated negative affect. Undifferentiated negative affect may increase risk for impulsivity among individuals with BPD and depressive disorders, and the current data suggest that this process can be relatively immediate as well as cumulative over the course of a day. This research supports the consideration of undifferentiated negative affect as a transdiagnostic construct, but one that may be particularly relevant for those with BPD. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Borderline personality disorder; Depressive disorder; Ecological momentary assessment; Emotion differentiation; Emotional granularity; Impulsivity","adult; aged; Article; borderline state; controlled study; depression; disease association; DSM-IV-TR; emotional disorder; fear; female; high risk patient; hostility; human; impulsiveness; major clinical study; male; prediction; risk assessment; sadness; undifferentiated negative affect; affect; borderline state; depression; impulsiveness; middle aged; physiology; psychology; young adult; Adult; Affect; Borderline Personality Disorder; Depressive Disorder; Fear; Female; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult","Trull, T.J.; Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, 210 McAlester Hall, United States; email: trullt@missouri.edu",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",0021843X,,JAPCA,"26147324","English","J.

A general relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild populations, which raises the question as to how variation in personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we investigated the relationship between individual personality differences and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated trappability - the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps - using capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a 1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability. Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to maintaining variation in boldness in the study population. © The Author 2015.

The behavioural phenotype of a conspecific is likely to affect the outcome of a social interaction, so an individual must be able to accurately assess behavioural phenotypes in order to optimize behavioural responses during mate choice, cooperative relationships and agonistic interactions. However, behavioural assessment based on dyadic interactions in different contexts can be costly because it may require significant time, increase the risk of predation and often necessitates special cognitive abilities. Different colour cues are associated with different life history strategies in many species, so coloration might also correlate with behavioural phenotype. Thus, conspecifics could use coloration as a single cue for the mediation of social interactions. We investigated the relationship between personality and coloration in the monogamous, biparental convict cichlid. This species has black melanin-based stripes with interindividual variation in the intensity of these stripes. In addition, females have bright orange spots on their abdomens. Using repeatable measures of boldness, exploration and aggressiveness, we were able to define a behavioural syndrome and quantified the behavioural type of each individual. Behavioural types were predicted by colour traits. In particular, proactive individuals (more aggressive, bolder and quicker to resume behaviour after being startled) were more likely to be dark and, among females, have smaller orange areas. Our results support the hypothesis that coloration in the convict cichlid is related to personality. Thus, coloration could play an important role in mediating social interactions, allowing a quick and reliable assessment of conspecifics' behavioural types. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Amatitlania siquia; Behavioural syndrome; Behavioural type; Coloration; Fish; Personality","agonistic behavior; behavioral response; cichlid; color; color morph; conspecific; life history trait; mate choice; phenotype; predation risk; reproductive success; Archocentrus nigrofasciatus","Schweitzer, C.; UMR CNRS 6282 Biogéosciences, Equipe Ecologie Evolutive, Université de Bourgogne, 6 bd Gabriel, France",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability). However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power. Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability, and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies. Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile traits are 'repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R>. 0), we suggest a shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time (if present). © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural syndromes; Metabolism; Mixed models; Personality; Plasticity",,"Biro, P.A.; Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life and Environmental Science, Deakin UniversityAustralia",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Studies aiming to do this typically assay personality in captivity and rely on the assumption that measures of traits in the laboratory reflect their expression in nature. We examined this rarely tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity.We focused on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies: shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly context-specific.

Here, I explore the consistency of individual differences in physiology and behaviour of n=53 shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) by repeatedly measuring haemolymph density (HD) and the crabs’ responses to a novel environment. In crustaceans, HD is directly proportional to protein concentrations, and thus indicative of physiological condition. HD was highly repeatable, and crabs showed consistent individual differences in their behavioural responses to a novel environment, thus indicating individual consistency in both physiology and behaviour. Furthermore, HD was significantly correlated with the crabs’ risk propensity, i.e. individuals with higher HD spent more time near shelter. Overall, this provides the first evidence for consistency in an endogenous physiological trait in an invertebrate. The link between consistent physiology and behaviour, i.e. coping styles, analogous to those found in vertebrates, suggests metabolic and/or immunological correlates of personality which offer great potential for future studies. ©2015 The Authors.","Coping styles; Crustaceans; Haemolymph density; Invertebrates; Personality; Physiology",,"Fürtbauer, I.; Department of Biosciences, College of Science, Swansea UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: i.fuertbauer@swansea.ac.uk",,"Royal Society Publishing",20545703,,,,"English","R.

Food availability is a known driver of body mass and reproductive investment in birds, but these traits may also depend on individual effects. Penguins show extreme intra-annual body mass variation and rely on accumulated body reserves for successful breeding. However, no study so far has tested individual consistency and phenotypic responses in body mass and reproductive investment in this taxon. Using a unique dataset on individually marked female and male southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) across six years, we investigated 1) the individual consistency in body mass (measured at egg laying), body condition and reproductive investment across years, subsequently 2) identified the bestexplanatory temperature-related environmental variables for female and male body mass, and 3) tested the effect of female and male body mass on reproductive investment. Body mass, body condition and reproductive investment were all highly repeatable. As body condition should control for the structural size of the birds, the similarly high repeatability estimates for body mass and body condition suggested that the consistent between-individual body mass differences were independent of structural size. This supported the use of body mass for the subsequent analyses. Body mass was higher under colder environmental conditions (positive Southern Annular Mode), but the overall phenotypic response appeared limited. Reproductive investment increased with female but not male body mass. While environmental effects on body mass in our study period were rather small, one can expect that ongoing global climate change will lead to a deterioration of food availability and we might therefore in the long-term expect a phenotypical decline in body mass and reproductive investment. © 2015 Dehnhard et al.",,"adult; animal experiment; Article; body constitution; body mass; body size; body temperature; climate change; controlled study; egg laying; egg production; environmental temperature; Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome; female; male; nonhuman; penguin; phenotypic plasticity; reproduction; seasonal variation; sex difference; animal; body mass; breeding; ecosystem; environment; nesting; physiology; procedures; reproduction; Aves; Eudyptes chrysocome; Spheniscidae; Animals; Body Mass Index; Breeding; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environment; Female; Male; Nesting Behavior; Oviposition; Reproduction; Spheniscidae",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"26030824","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934963327

Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r = 0.38–0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be related to either of two measures of public information use. While the personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious avenue for further research. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioural syndrome; Bold-shy; Innovation; Producer-scrounger; Social learning strategies; Temperament",,"Webster, M.M.; School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Harold Mitchell Building, United Kingdom",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

A reliable and useful method for rating personality pathology in adolescent patients has the potential to enhance conceptualization, dissemination, and treatment effectiveness. The aim of this study is to examine the clinical validity of a prototype matching approach (derived from the Shedler Westen Assessment Procedure-Adolescent Version) for quantifying personality pathology in an adolescent inpatient sample. Sixty-six adolescent inpatients and their parents or legal guardians completed forms of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) assessing emotional and behavioral problems. Clinical criterion variables including suicide history, substance use, and fights with peers were also assessed. Patients' individual and group therapists on the inpatient unit completed personality prototype ratings. Prototype diagnoses demonstrated substantial reliability (median intraclass correlation coefficient = .75) across independent ratings from individual and group therapists. Personality prototype ratings correlated with the CBCL scales and clinical criterion variables in anticipated and meaningful ways. As seen in prior research with adult samples, prototype personality ratings show clinical validity across independent clinician raters previously unfamiliar with the approach, and they are meaningfully related to clinical symptoms, behavioral problems, and adaptive functioning.

Similarly, it is poorly understood how consistent individual differences in decision making are influenced by their social context. Here we investigated whether zebrafish, Danio rerio, show individual consistency ('personality') in speed-accuracy trade-offs based on a colour discrimination task, and how pairs of fish with distinct personalities make consensus choices. The results showed that zebrafish exhibit between-individual speed-accuracy trade-offs: some fish made 'careful', slow but accurate decisions, while others made swift but less accurate choices. We also found that these decision-making strategies were constant over time: fish retained the same strategy for 3 days. When testing pairs of careful and fast-and-inaccurate individuals, the combined choice strategy was intermediate in speed, but statistically indistinguishable from the careful individual, whereas accuracy of the dyad decision was moderately higher than that of each individual when tested singly, although this was again not significantly different from the more careful individual. For the first time, our study thus demonstrates that two individuals influence one another's speed-accuracy trade-off in decision making. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural variation; Danio rerio; Decision making; Foraging; Repeatability; Social experience","accuracy assessment; behavioral ecology; color; cyprinid; decision making; foraging behavior; social behavior; trade-off; Animalia; Danio rerio","Chittka, L.; Biological and Experimental Psychology, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of LondonUnited Kingdom",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Nevertheless, the repeatability of foraging behaviour remains poorly understood. In particular, whether individuals differ in their respective degrees of repeatability still remains to be determined. Here, we estimated foraging behaviour repeatability in the great cormorant, at both the population and the individual levels, and assessed the effect of repeatability on individual foraging performance. At the population level, we found that some foraging variables were more repeatable (e.g. departure angle and trip duration) than others (e.g. time spent underwater per trip). At the individual level, we found differences in the degree of repeatability for each foraging variable, highlighting the presence of both highly flexible and highly consistent individuals in the population. The effect of repeatability on individual performance depended on the considered timescale: individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per dive was negatively related to foraging efficiency while individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per trip was positively related to foraging efficiency.

Objective: To examine construct validity, convergent validity, internal consistency and interrater reliability of the PSP in a sample of Mexican adolescents with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 40 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were evaluated with PSP, CGAS, PANSS and the MATRICS battery. Construct and convergent validity were determined by the correlation between PSP with PANSS factors, MATRICS dimensions and CGAS. In addition, reliability was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: PSP scores correlated with negative, excitement and cognitive factors of PANSS, CGAS as well as MATRICS domains. The PSP also showed high internal consistency and interrater reliability. Conclusions: The PSP is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of adolescent patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adolescents; Cognition; PSP; Rating scales; Social functioning; Spanish; Validity","adolescent; Article; Children Global Assessment Scale; clinical article; construct validity; convergent validity; female; human; internal consistency; interrater reliability; male; MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery; Mexican; neuropsychological test; Personal and Social Performance scale; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; priority journal; psychologic test; psychometry; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; child; human relation; personality; psychological rating scale; psychology; reproducibility; schizophrenia; social behavior; standards; translating (language); Adolescent; Child; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Personality; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Social Behavior; Translating","Ulloa, R.-E.; Child Psychiatric Hospital Dr. Juan N Navarro, San Buenaventura 86, Mexico",,"Elsevier",09209964,,SCRSE,"25728908","English","Schizophr.

The results indicate that bold males are likely to have a stronger shoaling propensity than shy males for unfamiliar conspecifics. Conversely, bold females are more likely to shoal than shy females, but only when presented with heterospecific individuals. Additionally, aggression does not correlate with boldness or shoaling propensity for either sex.

The original theory suggested that temperament traits were under genetic influences, whereas character traits were gradually built by an interaction between temperaments and environment until early adulthood. This study attempted to evaluate TCI by examining the genetic and environmental contributions to personality with particular attention to spousal effects. From 687 families, a total of 3459 Korean adult individuals completed the survey. Among them, there were 542 Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 122 Dizygotic twin pairs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and heritability were calculated to examine the genetic and shared environmental contributions to personality. Moderate genetic contributions (0.17-0.43) were found for all TCI traits along with the evidence of shared environment (0.11-0.31) for harm avoidance (HA) and all characters. The ICCs of TCI in MZ pairs ranged 0.36-0.46. Spouses' had little resemblance for temperament, whereas for character dimensions, spouses (0.27-0.38) were more similar than first degree relatives (0.10-0.29). Resemblance between spouses increased with duration of marriage for most characters and HA. When the growing similarities between spouses were compared with their MZ cotwins' for subgroup of 81 trios, self-directedness (SD) of character showed even more similarities toward their spouses than cotwins as partnership duration increased (r=0.32). Our findings with regard to change in SD into late adulthood support the psychobiological theory of temperament and character, which suggests that both personality domains have distinct developmental trajectories despite equally large genetic influences. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Heritability; Personality; Temperament and character inventory; Twin-family study","adult; adulthood; Article; avoidance behavior; character; correlation coefficient; dizygotic twins; environmental factor; female; health survey; heredity; heritability; human; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; marriage; monozygotic twins; personality; personality test; priority journal; spouse; temperament; Temperament and Character Inventory; character; environment; genetics; genotype environment interaction; longitudinal study; middle aged; personality; personality test; temperament; twins; Adult; Character; Environment; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Personality; Personality Inventory; Temperament; Twins","Sung, J.; Complex Disease and Genome Epidemiology Branch, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Seoul National University, #704, Bldg 220 1st GwanAk-Ro, South Korea; email: jsung@snu.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",00223956,,JPYRA,"25748752","English","J.

Typically these behavioural types are composed of bold, aggressive, dominant individuals and shy, less aggressive, subordinate individuals. Mountain chickadees living in varying climatic conditions across a montane environment appear to exhibit consistent behavioural types, such that high elevation birds, which experience harsher winter conditions and rely more heavily on spatial memory to retrieve food caches to survive winter, explore a novel environment at a slower rate (i.e., shy) and are socially subordinate to low elevation birds. Dominance is typically expressed in individual pairwise interactions, but it is not always clear which traits predispose an individual to become a dominant in such interactions. Aggression is frequently suggested to be associated with higher dominance status, yet the data are equivocal. Here we aimed to test whether previously described elevation related differences in social dominance might be associated with elevation related differences in aggression levels in mountain chickadees by using the mirror test. The mirror test can address potential differences in reactive and proactive aggression, although caution should be taken when using the mirror test as some species are able to self-recognize. Low elevation birds responded more aggressively to their mirror image than high elevation birds, suggesting that elevation related differences in aggression may be partially responsible for previously found differences in social dominance status. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","aggression; mirror test; mountain chickadee","Aves; Parus gambeli","Branch, C.L.; Department of Biology, Graduate Program in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology, University of Nevada, 1664 N.

Explorative and bold behaviours often covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence that the structure of these 'behavioural syndromes' can change across situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of fighting and of personality, we suggest that longitudinal studies of contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, would be a useful context for the study of animal personalities. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In territorial species, individuals often have to balance signalling towards unfamiliar potential competitors (to solely broadcast territory ownership) with signalling towards familiar immediate neighbours (to also maintain so-called ""dear enemy"" relations). Hence, to understand how signals evolve due to these multilevel relationships, it is important to understand how general signal traits vary in relation to the overall social environment. For many territorial songbirds dawn is a key signalling period, with several neighbouring individuals singing simultaneously without immediate conflict. In this study we tested whether sharing a territory boundary, rather than spatial proximity, is related to similarity in dawn song traits between territorial great tits (Parus major) in a wild personality-typed population. We collected a large dataset of automatized dawn song recordings from 72 unique male great tits, during the fertile period of their mate, and compared specific song traits between neighbours and nonneighbours. We show here that both song rate and start time of dawn song were repeatable song traits. Moreover, neighbours were significantly more dissimilar in song rate compared to non-neighbours, while there was no effect of proximity on song rate similarity. Additionally, similarity in start time of dawn song was unrelated to sharing a territory boundary, but birds were significantly more similar in start time of dawn song when they were breeding in close proximity of each other. We suggest that the dissimilarity in dawn song rate between neighbours is either the result of neighbouring great tits actively avoiding similar song rates to possibly prevent interference, or a passive consequence of territory settlement preferences relative to the types of neighbours. Neighbourhood structuring is therefore likely to be a relevant selection pressure shaping variation in territorial birdsong.

As cognitive remediation (CR) has recently been found to improve cognition in younger patients with schizophrenia, we investigated the efficacy, feasibility, and fidelity of a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program in youth with 22q11DS. METHODS: A longitudinal design was implemented in which 21 participants served as their own controls. Following an eight month baseline period in which no interventions were provided, cognitive coaches met with participants remotely for CR via video conferencing three times a week over a targeted 8month timeframe and facilitated their progress through the intervention, offering task-specific strategies. A subset of strategies were examined for fidelity. Outcomes were evaluated using a neurocognitive test battery at baseline, pre-treatment and post-treatment. RESULTS: All participants adhered to the intervention. The mean length of the treatment phase was 7.96months. A moderately high correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.73) was found for amount and type of strategies offered by coaches. Participants exhibited significant improvements (ES=.36-.55, p ≤.009) in working memory, shifting attention and cognitive flexibility. All significant models were driven by improvements in pre to post-treatment scores. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our preliminary investigation, a remote, hybrid strategy, computerized CR program can be implemented with 22q11DS youth despite geographic location, health, and cognitive deficits. It appears effective in enhancing cognitive skills during the developmental period of adolescence, making this type of CR delivery useful for youth with 22q11DS transitioning into post-school environments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) are the two main rs-fcMRI approaches to assess alterations in brain networks associated with individual differences, behavior and psychopathology. While the BOLD signal is stronger with a higher temporal resolution, ASL provides quantitative, direct measures of the physiology and metabolism of specific networks. This study systematically investigated the similarity and reliability of resting brain networks (RBNs) in BOLD and ASL. A 2. ×. 2. ×. 2 factorial design was employed where each subject underwent repeated BOLD and ASL rs-fcMRI scans on two occasions on two MRI scanners respectively. Both independent and joint FC analyses revealed common RBNs in ASL and BOLD rs-fcMRI with a moderate to high level of spatial overlap, verified by Dice Similarity Coefficients. Test-retest analyses indicated more reliable spatial network patterns in BOLD (average modal Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 0.905. ±. 0.033 between-sessions; 0.885. ±. 0.052 between-scanners) than ASL (0.545. ±. 0.048; 0.575. ±. 0.059). Nevertheless, ASL provided highly reproducible (0.955. ±. 0.021; 0.970. ±. 0.011) network-specific CBF measurements.

The evolutionary costs and benefits of certain personality traits are frequently assumed to fluctuate across different life history stages. However, little is still known about survival consequences of personality during juvenile life. We predicted survival costs of exploration tendency in juvenile European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which we studied under quasi-natural conditions. In addition, consistencies between exploration and the animal’s behavioral responses in other contexts were tested. Early exploratory behavior was assessed in two annual cohorts, either observationally by quantifying the time course of exploring the area around the nursery burrow shortly after emergence above ground or experimentally by conducting open-field tests shortly before emergence. In both years, the study revealed consistent results: more exploratory individuals had a lower chance of survival until the end of the vegetation period, presumably due to a higher predation risk. Fast explorers, as assessed by their exploration of the burrow environment, were also less sociable and tended to be more aggressive toward conspecifics as subadults. Sociability was repeatable across time. Furthermore, fast explorers, as assessed by their open-field behavior, were bolder in a handling test before emergence. These consistencies across context and time suggest the existence of personality. In conclusion, the results provide evidence for survival costs of fast exploration during juvenile life. The findings are in line with predictions on personality-related life history variation. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Animal personality; Early development; European rabbits; Individual differences; Oryctolagus cuniculus","behavioral response; burrow; emergence; fitness; juvenile; lagomorph; life history trait; natural selection; reproductive cost; small mammal; survival; exploration; life history theory; predation risk; Europe; Animalia; Mammalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus","Rödel, H.G.; Laboratoire d’Ethologie Expérimentale et Comparée E.A. 4443 (LEEC), Université Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cité, France",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Although there is some evidence that differences in personality among individuals within populations can be genetically based and adaptive, when and how individual personality differences emerge in a population is not well understood, but of considerable general interest. Here, using juveniles of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) as a model system, we investigated in the laboratory whether individuals consistently differ in their personalities and whether behavioral syndromes are apparent at an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality traits are heritable. Under standardized laboratory conditions and using sibling analysis, we quantified interindividual differences in their boldness behavior under potential predation threat and their exploratory activity in a novel environment, 2 ecologically important behaviors, as our focal personality traits and estimated their respective repeatability and heritability. We report for the first time consistent (repeatable) and heritable individual differences in boldness and exploratory behaviors, and a boldness-exploration behavioral syndrome, in young convict cichlids. Bolder fish were more exploratory than relatively timid ones. These results provide novel evidence for the emergence in early life history of consistent individual differences in personality traits and behavioral syndromes in this species and suggest that genetic variation for boldness and exploratory behaviors, and thus potential for selection on these traits, exists in our study population. © The Author 2014.

While the calls that aid in group cohesion are commonly used, some bats rarely or never produce them. Here, we examine whether the differences observed in the contact calling behaviour of T. tricolor are repeatable; that is, whether individual differences are consistent. We recorded contact calls of individuals in the field and rates and patterns of vocalization. To determine whether measured variables were consistent within individuals, we estimated repeatability (R), which compares within-individual to among-individual variance in behavioural traits. Our results show that repeatability for call variables was moderate but significant, and that repeatability was highest for the average number of calls produced (R=0.46–0.49). Our results demonstrate important individual differences in the contact calling behaviour of T. tricolor; we discuss how these could be the result of mechanisms such as frequency-dependent selection that favour groups composed of individuals with diverse vocal strategies.

Risk is likely perceived differently by individuals in relation to among-individual differences in correlated behavioral traits, that is, syndromes or personalities. Given that animals can avoid the risk of predation/disturbance through modification of their habitat use, we might expect individuals of differing behavioral types to adopt contrasting tactics of habitat use when faced with risky or stressful situations. We studied the relationship between habitat use and among-individual variation in behavioral profile in a population of roe deer. We hypothesized that an individual's habitat use tactics should be related to their capacity to cope with risky situations. In particular, we predicted that more reactive (risk-averse) roe deer, with relatively high behavioral response and high body temperature at capture, long flight distances and which were more vigilant during feeding, should use riskier open habitat less, particularly when risk is high. We found that although the use of open habitat during the day was negatively correlated with the indices of reactivity at capture, it was also positively correlated with indices of reactivity while foraging in open habitat. Furthermore, most of the behavioral parameters we measured were intercorrelated and moderately repeatable, potentially indexing personality traits. We conclude that there is substantial interindividual variability in how individuals manage risky situations which imposes constraints on how they are able to exploit high-risk habitats, suggesting the existence of a risk management syndrome in this large herbivore. © The Author 2014.","Behavior at capture; Behavioral syndrome; Body temperature; Flight distance; Risk-taking; Vigilance","behavioral response; body temperature; deer; habitat use; individual variation; predation risk; risk assessment; Animalia; Capreolus","Bonnot, N.; INRA, UR35 Comportement et Ecologie de la Faune Sauvage, CS 52627France",,"Oxford University Press",10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Although sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post- exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23% lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial alteration of personality differences even in absence of a population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations, exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on non-targeted fauna. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Animal personality; Anthropogenic disturbance; Behavioural syndromes; Consistent individual variation; Contaminants; Multivariate mixed models; Pesticides","adaptation; agricultural ecosystem; behavioral response; individual variation; multivariate analysis; organophosphorus pesticide; pollution tolerance; prey capture; spider; sublethal effect; toxicity; Animalia; Araneae; Arthropoda; Eris militaris; Salticidae","Royauté, R.; Department of Natural Resource Sciences, McGill University, Macdonald Campus, Canada",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02698463,,FECOE,,"English","Funct.

Indeed, few authors have investigated the role of other important spatial traits such as home range, movement distance, vertical activity, and site fidelity, and it is not clear whether these behaviors are correlated with dispersal. In this study, we investigated individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior: repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable, cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range, movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast, behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from ""resident"" individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity, and minimal movement to ""mobile"" individuals with large home ranges, high movement rates, and little site fidelity. Our findings suggest animal personality can play a key role in shaping the space use of individuals, and this diversity in spatial behaviors may be too complex to be captured by often used simple linear measures of dispersal. © 2014 The Author 2014.","Bayesian mixed models burbot; home range; movement; site fidelity; telemetry; temperament","activity pattern; array; behavioral ecology; biotelemetry; data set; dispersal; ecological modeling; gadoid; heterogeneity; home range; movement; site fidelity; space use; spatial analysis; wild population; Animalia; Lota; Lota lota","Harrison, P.M.; Department of Biology, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Canada",,"Oxford University Press",10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals: tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results, such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality assays that test individuals alone. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Aggressiveness; Personality assays; Social behaviour","aggression; behavioral response; bird; body size; dominance; empirical analysis; group behavior; individual variation; passerine; testing method; Animalia; Aves; Estrilda astrild","Funghi, C.; CIBIO-Centro de Investigação em Biodiversidade e Recursos Genáticos, Universidade do Porto, Campus Agrario de Vairão, Rua P. de Armando Quintas, Portugal",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925802401

This interchangeable usage of terminology has contributed to confusion within the field of animal behavior and limits the study of the phenomenon. Here we use a rapid, non-exhaustive and repeatable search strategy literature review to investigate where there were unique distinctions between these three terms and where there was an overlap in their usage. We identified three main areas of confusion in terminology: historical usage which is not updated; a lack of precision between different fields of study; and a lack of precision between different levels of variation. We propose a framework with which to understand and define the terms based on the levels of variation ethologists are interested in.

With organisms being increasingly exposed to rapid environmental changes, there is growing interest in understanding individual phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in predation pressure. Behavioural and physiological responses to predator exposure are of particular interest as differences in predation pressure are often reflected in correlated suites of behavioural and hormonal profiles across populations. Within populations, the association between endocrine profiles and behaviour is less understood and often lacking. Adopting a reaction norm approach and a repeated measures design, we assessed within-population effects of changes in perceived predation risk on endocrinology and behaviour in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly exposed subjects to a robotic model predator and assessed their behavioural response. The fish showed consistent behavioural profiles and were less active and shyer when predation risk was higher. Using non-invasive waterborne hormone analysis, we assessed basal cortisol as well as the cortisol response to changes in predation risk. Individuals showed significantly higher cortisol levels following exposure to the model predator. Individual post-predator exposure cortisol was repeatable but unrelated to behavioural responses. Accounting for between versus within-subject effects, we found that basal cortisol and shyness were positively related within individuals, that is individuals overall were shyer on days they had higher cortisol levels. We also tested if basal testosterone predicted risky behaviour and found no evidence for this hypothesis. No individual differences in hormonal or behavioural responses to changes in predation risk were found, suggesting that individuals are not constrained by their personalities in their ability to cope with a potentially harmful threat. Overall, we show that individuals of different personalities are equally 'flexible' in their response to changes in predation pressure. Our study offers novel insight into consistent individual differences and plasticity in hormones and behaviour as well as their interplay within populations. Future studies should assess the applicability of these findings to other changes in the environment, as well as the effects of social context on endocrine and behavioural reaction norms. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Anti-predator response; Coping styles; Cortisol; Individual differences; Shyness; Stress; Testosterone; Waterborne hormone analysis","adaptation; antipredator defense; behavioral response; endocrinology; environmental change; fish; individual variation; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; testosterone; Gasterosteus aculeatus","Fürtbauer, I.; Department of Biosciences, College of Science, Swansea UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02698463,,FECOE,,"English","Funct.

We addressed this influential hypothesis by combining behavioral studies with fine-scale positional scoring in nature, estimating how individual movement strategies in brown trout (Salmo trutta) associate with fitness correlates (growth and survival) in the wild. Initial dispersal in the wild was positively related to the laboratory activity. Moreover, the growth of individuals with high laboratory activity decreased with increasing home range size, whereas the growth of individuals with lower laboratory activity increased slightly with increasing home range size. Survival in the wild was not associated with laboratory activity. Our results do not support the original pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. As an alternative explanation, we suggest that the growth of individuals adopting a high-activity strategy is more sensitive to variation in resource abundance (indicated by home range size) than the fitness individuals adopting a more passive strategy. © The Author 2014.

An understanding of this inter-individual variation is essential to improve our knowledge of the adaptive value of behaviour. Coping styles may have implications in diverse fields, so the development of appropriate screening methods for each species appears to be the most effective way to extend our knowledge and to incorporate behavioural responses into selection-based breeding programmes, to improve the domestication and welfare of farmed fish. We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation, aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact. By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and long-term). These tests therefore appeared to be the most relevant for the characterisation of coping style in European seabass. Furthermore, the results of these tests were also predictive of cortisol stress response. These tests are simple to perform and can be used to screen large numbers of fish, the first step in selection programmes including behavioural profiles. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioural plasticity; Dicentrarchus labrax; Life stages; Repeatability","behavioral response; coping strategy; domestication; fish; juvenile; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; Europe; Dicentrarchus labrax","Ferrari, S.; IFREMER, Laboratoire Ressources Halieutiques, Place Gaby Coll, BP7, France",,"Elsevier",01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

Here we attempted to measure five key behavioural traits (aggression, boldness, exploration, activity and sociability) in a native Australian social skink, Egernia whitii. Specifically, we documented the temporal consistency of trait structural definition, the temporal consistency of trait expression and the relationships between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We found (1) that the structural consistency of some traits (boldness), but not others (aggressiveness and exploration), changed across time and according to sex (i.e. the relationship between the raw behaviours that were measured in the boldness assay was different for males and females); (2) that three of the five behavioural traits exhibited moderate-to-high adjusted repeatability while two were not repeatable; (3) covariances between behavioural traits were weak to non-existent and did not support the presence of any behavioural syndromes. These results indicate that structural consistency of traits or the behavioural 'definition' of an aggregate score is potentially variable over time. This may limit inference on any subsequent estimates of repeatability of behavioural traits, as well as estimates of potential syndromes. Repeatability of behavioural traits may reflect underlying ecological importance, or measurement processes, and lack of behavioural syndromes may reflect lack of selection pressure for trait covariance. Studies examining multiple behavioural traits under a measurement as well as an ecological framework are crucial to make meaningful inferences regarding the ecological and evolutionary significance of behavioural traits. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.","Animal personality; Behavioural plasticity; Behavioural syndromes; Correlated behaviours; Reptiles","behavioral response; ecological approach; lizard; phenotypic plasticity; selection; temporal analysis; Australia; Animalia; Egernia whitii; Reptilia; Squamata","Mcevoy, J.; School of Biological Science, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 55, Australia",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09528369,,JOZOE,,"English","J.

The presence and conservation of a behavioural syndrome throughout evolutionary times suggests it confers various advantages at a population level. In eels, such as the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), activity and aggressiveness are important factors in their life history, since both traits influence dispersal and territoriality. In the present study we investigated whether these behavioural traits were consistent at both the nychtemeral scale (24 h) and over a long time period (7 months). In addition, we investigated if aggressiveness and activity were positively correlated. Both activity and aggressiveness were significantly repeatable, indicating that both behavioural traits could be considered as personality traits. Interestingly, nocturnal activity was correlated to diurnal activity, indicating that this personality trait was highly stable at the circadian scale. Both aggressiveness and activity were correlated in the course of the experiment, underlining the presence of a behavioural syndrome. The detection of two behaviourally distinct groups in juvenile eels: aggressive and active individuals versus their counterpart have implications in the understanding of the colonization profile of the watershed.We discuss these findings in relation to the ecology of this species. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","activity; aggressiveness; behavioural syndrome; eel; fish; migration","Anguilla anguilla; Animalia","Geffroy, B.; Universidade Ferderal Do Mato Grosso UFMT, SINOP, Avenida Alexandre Ferronato 1200 Setor industrial, Brazil",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924028647

If such a model is valid, then stress response traits should be repeatable and physiological and behavioral responses should also change in an integrated manner along a major axis of among-individual variation. While there is some evidence of association between endocrine and behavioral stress response traits, few studies incorporate repeated observations of both. To test this model, we use a multivariate, repeated measures approach in a captive-bred population of Xiphophorus birchmanni. We quantify among-individual variation in behavioral stress response to an open field trial (OFT) with simulated predator attack (SPA) and measure waterborne steroid hormone levels (cortisol, 11-ketotestosterone) before and after exposure. Under the mild stress stimulus (OFT), (multivariate) behavioral variation among individuals was consistent with a strong axis of personality (shy-bold) or coping style (reactive-proactive) variation. However, behavioral responses to a moderate stressor (SPA) were less repeatable, and robust statistical support for repeatable endocrine state over the full sampling period was limited to 11-ketotestosterone. Although post hoc analysis suggested cortisol expression was repeatable over short time periods, qualitative relationships between behavior and glucocorticoid levels were counter to our a priori expectations. Thus, while our results clearly show among-individual differences in behavioral and endocrine traits associated with stress response, the correlation structure between these is not consistent with a simple proactive-reactive axis of integrated stress-coping style. Additionally, the low repeatability of cortisol suggests caution is warranted if single observations (or indeed repeat measures over short sampling periods) of glucocorticoid traits are used in ecological or evolutionary studies focussed at the individual level. © 2015 The Authors.","11-ketotestosterone; Boldness; Cortisol; Multivariate behavior; Repeatability; Waterborne steroid collection",,"Wilson, A.J.; College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Treliever Road, United Kingdom",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",20457758,,,,"English","Ecology and Evolution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922819300

Different combinations of personality traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in physiology. For example, 'fast' (bold, active, fast exploring) individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than 'slow' animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative stress. Thus, the 'extended pace of life theory' predicts that 'fast' individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than 'slow' ones. Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in 'slow' individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage vs. after 15 min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Antioxidant defences; Exploratory tendency; Neophobia; Pace of life; Reactive oxygen metabolites","body condition; captivity; fitness; hormone; metabolism; metabolite; oxidation; passerine; physiology; prediction; standardization; wild population; Animalia; Aves","Arnold, K.E.; Environment Department, University of YorkUnited Kingdom",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02698463,,FECOE,,"English","Funct.

We tested the hypothesis that exploration, boldness, and defensive behaviours are related to body size, sex, and reproductive status in eastern garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis. We also tested whether the measured behavioural traits were consistent through time (i.e., whether eastern garter snakes could have personalities) and whether the measured behavioural traits were related to one another (i.e., whether behavioural syndromes could be present in eastern garter snakes). Males and non-gravid females were more likely to flee than gravid females when faced with an attack. Males and non-gravid females were also more active after the attack than before the attack, whereas gravid females were more active before the attack. Furthermore, longer females explored less than smaller females, with a more precipitous decline of exploration as a function of size in gravid females than in non-gravid females. In contrast, longer males explored more than smaller males.

Four different measures of urbanization have been proposed: (1) year when a rural population became urbanized, as judged by direct observations of the first reproducing individuals in the urban habitat; (2) the difference in population density between urban and rural habitats with higher density in urban habitats reflecting more ancient and hence more advanced urbanization; (3) at least one urban population having higher population density in urban than in nearby rural populations of the same species; and (4) records of reproduction in city centers. The three largest mean effect sizes (Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient) reflecting likelihood of urbanization of birds were 0.47 for predation-related factors, 0.46 for geographic range and population density, and 0.29 for body size. The year of urbanization for different populations of the same bird species had a repeatability of 0.44 among sites. The difference in population density between nearby urban and rural habitats had a repeatability of 0.26 among the same sites. Selection for adaptation to the novel urban environment included (1) a reduction in dispersal propensity and hence a reduction in morphology associated with efficient flight or movement; (2) changes in vocalizations of birds and other organisms to cope with altered urban noise; (3) changes in songs and positions in the vegetation used for song related to changes in a predator community between rural and urban habitats; (4) changes in flight distance due to change in predator community; and (5) a change in flight behavior in response to the proximity of humans toward perpendicular flights away from the walking direction of humans to avoid human disturbance. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Dispersal; Flight initiation distance; Heat island effect; Indicator ability; Selection; Spatial scale; Temporal scale; Urbanization",,"Møller, A.P.; Université Paris-Sud, CNRS UMR 8079, Bâtiment 362, France",,"Springer Netherlands",,9789401794992; 9789401794985,,,"English","Environmental Indicators",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943598404

Lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus (Linnaeus 1758) are dietary generalists, foraging in both terrestrial and marine habitats during breeding. We investigate what affects the gulls' propensity to forage at sea or on land. We assess the importance of terrestrial foraging to gulls in the Baltic Sea (sub. sp. L. f. fuscus), looking especially at their use of agricultural fields. Results: Through the GPS tracking of 19 individuals across 3 years we tracked 1038 foraging trips and found that 21.2 % of foraging trips were predominantly terrestrial, 9.0 % were a mix of terrestrial and marine, and 68.5 % were exclusively marine. Terrestrial trips were (1) more frequent when departing around sunrise, whereas marine trips occurred throughout the day. Additionally, trips with mostly land-based foraging decreased as the breeding season progressed, suggesting dietary switching coincident with the onset of chick provisioning. (2) During cloudy and cold conditions terrestrial foraging trips were more likely. (3) We found no differences between sexes in their land-based foraging strategy. (4) Gull individuals showed great variation in foraging strategy. Using observations of agricultural fields, carried out for one year, we found that (5) gulls preferentially foraged on fields with short vegetation, and there was a positive association with occurrence of waders and other species of gulls. (6) The availability and use of these preferred fields decreased through the breeding period. Conclusions: This study found high prevalence of terrestrial foraging during early breeding as well as support for dietary switching early in the breeding season. The overall tendency for marine or terrestrial foraging was consistent within individuals, with gull identity accounting for much of the variation observed in foraging trips. Our results suggest that anthropogenic terrestrial food sources may play a role in the low breeding success of these gulls through either variation in quantity and/or quality. Finally, our study demonstrates the potential of combining data from GPS-tracking of individual animals with the 'ground-truthing' of habitat visited to elucidate the otherwise nebulous behavior of a generalist predator. © 2016 Isaksson et al.","Behavioral plasticity; Foraging ecology; Generalist foraging; GPS tracking; Ground-truthing; Habitat use; Individual repeatability; Larus fuscus; Lesser black-backed gull",,"Isaksson, N.; Centre for Animal Movement Research, Department of Biology, Lund University, Ecology Building, Sweden; email: natalie.isaksson@biol.lu.se",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",20513933,,,,"English","Mov.

Although the relationships between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and personality traits have been recently tested several times, we still do not know whether personality is related to the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of free-living individuals in their natural habitat. The objectives of this study were to assess the links between RMR, DEE, and two personality traits (exploration in an open-field and docility during handling) in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Using a multivariate mixed model, we found that exploration and docility were significantly correlated at the among-individual level, confirming the presence of a behavioral syndrome within our population. We also found that exploration, but not docility, was negatively correlated with DEE. Hence, fast explorers show lower DEE levels than slow explorers, independently of RMR and docility.

Newly-settled fish were observed in aquaria and in the field on replicated patches of natural habitat cleared of resident fishes. Seven behavioral traits representing aspects of boldness, activity and aggression were monitored directly and via video camera over short (minutes), medium (hours), and long (3 days) time scales. With the exception of aggression, these behaviors were found to be moderately or highly consistent over all time scales in both laboratory and field settings, implying that these fish show stable personalities within various settings.

Evidence for selection acting on personality is biased toward species where behavioral and life-history information can readily be collected in the wild, such as ungulates and passerine birds. Here, we report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow, flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed. Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance. Our findings, therefore, forcefully demonstrate that personality variation exists in wild insects and that it is associated with components of fitness. © The Author 2014.

Although widely described as ""reliable and valid"" in research reports, several recent field studies have suggested that PCL-R scores provided by examiners in forensic cases are significantly less reliable than the interrater reliability values reported in research studies. Most of these field studies, however, have had small samples and only examined SVP civil commitment cases. This study builds on existing research by examining the reliability of PCL-R scores provided by forensic examiners in a much more extensive sample of Canadian criminal cases. Using the LexisNexis database, we identified 102 cases in which at least 2 scores were reported (of 257 total PCL-R scores). The single-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC<inf>A1</inf>) was .59, indicating that a large percentage of the variance in individual scores was attributable to some form of error. ICC values were somewhat higher for sexual offending cases (.66) than they were for nonsexual offending cases (46), indicating that poor interrater reliability was not restricted specifically to the assessment of sexual offenders. These and earlier findings concerning field reliability in legal cases suggest that the standard error of measurement for PCL-R scores that are provided to the courts is likely to be much larger than the value of 2.90 reported in the instrument's manual. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Criminals; Field reliability; Forensic assessment; Interrater reliability; Psychopathy checklist-revised","Article; Canada; case study; controlled study; criminal behavior; criminal justice; criminal law; forensic science; human; medicolegal aspect; Psychopathy Checklist Revised score; reliability; scoring system; sexual crime; adult; antisocial personality disorder; checklist; forensic psychiatry; male; middle aged; observer variation; personality assessment; prisoner; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; validation study; violence; Adult; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Canada; Checklist; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Dangerous Behavior; Forensic Psychiatry; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Personality Assessment; Prisoners; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Sex Offenses; Violence","Edens, J.F.; Department of Psychology, Texas A and M University, TAMU 4235, United States",,"American Psychological Association Inc.",10403590,,PYASE,"25486503","English","Psychol.

As part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993) suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus, referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample of domestic piglets (n=3555). By using a statistical resampling analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26 days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably represents a unimodal distribution with a 'ceiling-effect'. The intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation (r<inf>S</inf>) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r<inf>S</inf>=0.19-0.45, p<0.001; R=0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum from active to passive coping behaviour.

We captured wild zebra finches around 2 breeding colonies and assayed their exploratory behavior with a novel environment test. The birds' foraging behavior in the wild was also measured with the use of a passive integrated transponder tag system to monitor their use of feeders that were periodically moved around the colonies to assess exploratory behavior and sociality. During the same period, individuals' reproductive success was monitored at the nest-boxes being used in this area. We found that our measures of sociality, wild, and captive exploration were repeatable, but contrary to our predictions, exploration in the novel environment test was not significantly correlated with exploration of feeders in the wild. We failed to find a predicted negative relationship between exploration and sociality, instead finding a significant positive correlation between exploration in the novel environment and sociality. Finally, we found little evidence that any of our measured personality traits influenced reproductive success at the colony, either individually or when the interactions between the personalities of both members of the pair were taken into account. The only exception was that highly exploratory males (assayed with wild feeder behavior) were more likely to make breeding attempts than less exploratory males. Our results suggest that researchers should use caution when using tests such as the classic novel environment test to make inferences about personality in wild populations. © The Author 2014.

Although courtship display is generally consistent in terms of behavioural sequence and structure, there is also commonly important variation in the intensity of courtship display between and within males of a given species. Indeed, not all males have the same ability to perform courtship display (variation between males), and each male can potentially adjust his courtship effort in response to the environment (variation within a male). Although the study of male courtship display has received considerable attention in recent years, it is still unclear which part of the variation can be explained by male ability or motivation. We investigated this issue on two phases of the complex courtship display of the palmate newt Lissotriton helveticus. Overall, we found that both male and female identities affected courtship behaviour, but the relative influence of each sex depended on the courtship phase. Male identity explained variation in fan and creep-quiver display, whereas female identity explained variation in creep-quiver only. Interestingly, we did not find any link between the expression of courtship display and male or female morphological traits. Our study showed consistency of male courtship display in newts and successfully dissects the different sources of variation that can affect behavioural repeatability/consistency of courtship display. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Behavioural consistency; Behavioural type; Lissotriton helveticus; Mate choice; Palmate newt; Personality; Repeatability; Sexual selection","amphibian; behavioral response; courtship; display behavior; environmental gradient; gender identity; morphology; sexual selection; Salamandridae; Triturus helveticus","Cornuau, J.H.Terroïko, 2 rue Clémence Isaure, France",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921478496

Aggression is a complex trait that can be difficult to accurately measure. The literature on fish behavior describes many different methodologies to examine aggression, which, we believe, have not been compared in a formal manner. In this study we observed 19 individual zebrafish (Danio rerio) and quantified bites, lateral displays, charges, darts, and time near the stimulus in six common assays used to measure aggression. The methodologies included an inclined mirror assay, two flat mirror assays with different acclimation periods, a live conspecific assay, a clay model stimulus assay, and a video recording assay. Our results indicate high repeatability in most aggressive behaviors over time, which confirms the value of each assay to measure personality. However, our results also indicate significant differences between the assays. Specifically, assays using a flat mirror or live conspecific as a stimulus for aggression elicited more attempted bites than an inclined mirror, a clay model stimulus, or a video recording stimulus. Furthermore, the inclined mirror stimulus provoked more darts than any other assay. The results suggest the need for researchers to consider specific research goals when selecting the appropriate stimulus to provoke aggression in zebrafish. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Danio rerio; aggression; animal; animal behavior; physiology; reproducibility; videorecording; zebra fish; Aggression; Aggression; Animals; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Behavior, Animal; Reproducibility of Results; Reproducibility of Results; Video Recording; Video Recording; Zebrafish; Zebrafish","McRobert, S.P.; Department of Biology, Saint Joseph's UniversityUnited States",,"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",15458547,,,"25621988","English","Zebrafish",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925325822

Behavioral syndromes, on the other hand, appear as consistent individual variation in behavior that is both repeatable for individuals within a functional context (e.g., consistent voracity toward prey) and correlated across contexts (e.g., high voracity toward prey and high levels of boldness toward enemies). Thus, adaptive plasticity and syndromes represent two extremes of a behavioral plasticity continuum upon which most behavioral phenotypes fall. We tested for both adaptive plasticity and behavioral syndromes in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. We measured behavior in three contexts: startle, startle + prey, and startle + mate, and found (1) classic behaviorally plastic responses to predation risk, (2) high repeatability of behavior within contexts, and (3) evidence of a correlation between startle + prey and startle + mate contexts, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. As relative behavioral plasticity may vary across populations, we also compared urban and desert populations to test whether spiders from these habitats exhibit different behaviors and/or behavioral syndromes. While we found that urban males used in mating trials courted urban females significantly more than desert females, we found no other differences in the behavior of urban and desert black widows. Thus, black widows, regardless of habitat, are characterized by both context-specific behavioral plasticity and across-context correlations, presenting a phenotypic complexity that is likely exhibited, to varying degrees, by most organisms. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Latrodectus hesperus; Behavioral plasticity; Behavioral syndromes; Human-induced rapid environmental change","Latrodectus; Latrodectus hesperus","Halpin, R.N.16185 West Lincoln Street, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027936746

Many factors, including temperament, contribute to those reproductive parameters. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of temperament on reproductive performance of beef cows. In Experiment 1, Angus and Angus-cross beef cows (n = 1546) from eight locations were assigned a body condition score (BCS; 1 = emaciated; 9 = obese) and chute exit and gait score (1 = slow exit, walk; calm temperament; 2 = jump, trot or run; excitable temperament). Cows were grouped with bulls (1 : 25 to 1 : 30; with satisfactory breeding potential and free of venereal disease) for an 85-day breeding season. Pregnancy status and stage of gestation were determined (transrectal palpation) 35 days after the end of the breeding season. Controlling for BCS (p < 0.01) and handling facility (p < 0.0001) and handling facility by temperament score interaction (p < 0.001), breeding season pregnancy rate was lower in excited versus calm cows [88.6% (798/901) vs 94.1% (607/645); p < 0.001]. Cows with an excitable temperament took 24 more days to become pregnant compared to calm cows (median days to pregnancy, 35 vs 59 days; p < 0.0001). In Experiment 2, Angus and Angus-cross beef cows (n = 1407) from 8 locations were assigned scores for body condition and chute exit and gait (as described in Experiment 1) and assigned to bulls (breeding sound and free of venereal disease; 1 : 25 to 1 : 30) for 85 days. Pregnancy status was determined by transrectal palpation at 2 and 6 months after the onset of the breeding season. Controlling for BCS (p < 0.05), pregnancy loss was higher in excited versus calm cows [5.5% (36/651) vs 3.2% (20/623), p < 0.0001]. In conclusion, beef cows with an excitable temperament had significantly lower reproductive performance than calmer cows. The modified two-point chute exit-gait scoring method was repeatable and identified cattle with an excitable temperament. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"animal; animal behavior; body composition; bovine; female; physiological stress; physiology; pregnancy; reproduction; temperament; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Composition; Cattle; Female; Pregnancy; Reproduction; Stress, Physiological; Temperament",,,,14390531,,,"25293406","English","Reprod.

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects—including parental and epigenetic contributors—and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Additive genetic variation; Among-individual variation; Personality","animal; environmental effect; evolutionary biology; genetic variation; heritability; phenotype; animal; biological model; genetic variability; genetics; invertebrate; meta analysis; personality; physiology; quantitative trait; vertebrate; Animals; Genetic Variation; genetics; genetics; genetics; Invertebrates; Models, Genetic; Personality; physiology; physiology; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Vertebrates","Dochtermann, N.A.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State UniversityUnited States",,"Royal Society of London",09628452,,PRLBA,"25392476","English","Proc.

We address this question by modeling individual differences in behavioral developmental trajectories on the basis of two assumptions: (1) differences among individuals in the behavior expressed at birth or hatching are based on information from their ancestors (via genes, epigenes, and prenatal maternal effects), and (2) information from ancestors is combined with information from personal experiences over ontogeny via Bayesian updating. The model predicts relationships between the means and the variability of the behavior expressed by neonates and the subsequent developmental trajectories of their behavior when every individual is reared under the same environmental conditions. Several predictions of the model are supported by data from previous studies of behavioral development, for example, that the temporal stability of personality will increase with age and that the intercepts and slopes of developmental trajectories for boldness will be negatively correlated across individuals or genotypes when subjects are raised in safe environments. We describe how other specific predictions of the model can be used to test the hypothesis that information from ancestors and information from personal experiences are combined via nonadditive, Bayesian-like processes. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

Two critical predictions of this concept are individual consistency of neurophysiological and behavioral responses (relative to population variability) and a negative relationship between aggression/proactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity. Recent studies failed to provide strong support for these predictions, especially outside of strictly controlled conditions, and long-term measures to test the first prediction are rare. Here, we demonstrate individual repeatability across 2-3years of maximum circulating corticosterone concentration [CORT] and area under the [CORT] response curve (AUCI) during a standard capture-restraint test in wild, free-living adult Nazca boobies (Sula granti). We also show that the stress response predicts the personality traits aggression and anxiety in these birds (measured in the wild); however, the strength of these results was weak. Maximum [CORT] and AUCI showed higher repeatability between years than baseline [CORT]. After controlling breeding status, sex, mass, date sampled, and their interactions, baseline [CORT] was most closely related to personality traits, followed by AUCI, and then maximum [CORT]. The direction of these relationships depended on whether the testing context was social or non-social. [CORT] parameters had little to no relationship with cross-context plasticity in personality traits. Our results generally affirm two critical predictions of coping styles, but match the emerging trend that these relationships are weak in the wild, and may depend on testing context. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Coping style; Glucocorticoid; Personality; Plasticity; Stress response","corticosterone; corticosterone; adult; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; anxiety; Article; body weight; breeding; coping behavior; displacement behavior; female; field study; gardening; male; mark recapture; nonhuman; personality; personality test; phenotypic plasticity; priority journal; seabird; sex; shaking; social aggression; social gardening; social shaking; stress; Sula granti; wild animal; animal; animal behavior; bird; blood; hypothalamus hypophysis system; physiological stress; physiology; reproducibility; statistical model; time; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Birds; Body Weight; Breeding; Corticosterone; Female; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Linear Models; Male; Personality; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Physiological; Time Factors","Grace, J.K.; Dept. of Biology, Wake Forest UniversityUnited States",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,"25220912","English","Gen.

Horses, as other group-living polygynous mammals, form stable linear dominance hierarchies based on agonistic interactions. Higher dominance positions are believed to be connected, in both sexes, to better condition and higher reproductive success. Many variables play a role in forming the dominant-submissive relationships between horses; however, the maternal effect on the dominance position of the offspring still remains unclear, as do the possible mechanisms of transference (“inheritance”). We hypothesized that the maternal dominance position, plus differences in suckling parameters or maternal style, may be responsible for later outcome of the offspring’s dominance position, characterized by 2 variables: index of fighting success (CB); and rate of winning encounters (RW). Our study animals were 8 groups of Kladruby horses, loose-housed lactating mares with foals (n = 66 mare-foal pairs); and subsequently 4 groups of the same foals at 3 yr of age. Our results revealed the impact of age on the dominance position of the young horses (P < 0.001 for CB, and P < 0.01 for RW), and residence in the group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, respectively); not the maternal dominance position. Older foals reached higher dominance positions, independent of the dominance position, age, or experience of the mother; therefore, we did not find support for direct inheritance of maternal rank. Nevertheless, the foals born to the same mare in 2 consecutive seasons (n = 16 mares) revealed fair repeatability in the dominance position they obtained at 3 yr of age (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.46). This suggests an important constant effect of the mother on the social success of her progeny; however, we did not find a significant effect of any of the tested variables describing maternal characteristics or maternal care. Dominance position depended significantly on the foal’s age at observation, and the residence in the herd formed via sequential introducing of later-weaned groups of foals.

It was also tested if individually assessed personality predicts fish behaviour in groups, in the presence of natural predators. Perca fluviatilis showed individually repeatable behaviour both in individual and in group tests. Capture order, capture method, condition factor or past growth rate did not explain variation in individual behaviour. Individually determined boldness as well as fish size, however, were positively associated with first entrance to the predator zone (i.e. initial risk taking) in group behaviour tests. Individually determined boldness also explained long-term activity and total time spent in the vicinity of predators in the group. These findings suggest that individual and laboratory-based boldness tests predict boldness of P. fluviatilis in also ecologically relevant conditions, i.e. in shoals and in the presence of natural predators. The present results, however, also indicate that the above-mentioned two angling methods may not be selective for certain behavioural types in comparison to each other. © 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Behavioural type; Fisheries-induced evolution; Group behaviour; Growth; Personality; Selectivity","Perca fluviatilis; animal; animal behavior; ecosystem; Finland; human activities; lake; perch; personality; physiology; predation; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Finland; Human Activities; Lakes; Perches; Personality; Predatory Behavior","Kekäläinen, J.; Department of Biology, University of Eastern Finland, P.

Such adaptations include activity rhythms, orientation, zonation, burrowing, escape responses and feeding strategies, the first two being common adaptations to all mobile animals. The complex conditions of a particular beach environment may be integrated in a learning process enhancing the adaptation and survival of individuals and eventually of populations. Evidence exists of genetic determination of some behavioural features that are adaptive in the long term (throughout generations) by increasing individual survival and reproductive potential. The environmental features integrated with the life history of beach animals shape the individual behaviour through ontogenetic processes, as well as population behaviour through evolutionary processes. Thus, behavioural differences among individuals may reflect environmental variation at the local and small/medium temporal scales of beach processes, whereas within-population behavioural coherence and differences among populations may reflect variation at the geographic scale. The different foci stressed by different authors and the variety of evidence dependent upon local geographical and ecological conditions have often resulted in compartmentalised explanations, making generalizations and the repeatability of behavioural studies of beach ecology challenging. There was a need to developing a more synthetic paradigm for beach animal behaviour. This paper gives a brief overview of the theoretical background and keystone studies, which have contributed to our understanding of animal behaviour in sandy beach ecology, and proposes testable hypotheses to be integrated in the beach ecology paradigm. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Activity rhythms; Atlantic coasts; Behavioural adaptation; British Islands; California; Chile; Indian Ocean coasts; Italy; Mediterranean coasts; Mobile beach macrofauna; Orientation; Pacific coasts; Phenotypic plasticity; Sandy beaches; South Africa","adaptation; beach morphology; behavioral ecology; environmental change; evolutionary theory; learning; life history; mobility; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive potential; survival; temporal analysis","Scapini, F.; Department of Biology, University of Florence, Via Romana, 17, Italy",,"Academic Press",02727714,,ECSSD,,"English","Estuar.

However this stability has only been shown for male rats. Considering that anxiety disorders are most prevalent in women, it's crucial that females are tested in animal models. With this in mind, the stability over time of female rats in the free-exploratory paradigm was evaluated using a test-retest procedure. The behaviour of drug-naive, adult, female, Wistar rats was measured in the free-exploratory apparatus on two occasions two months apart. The following parameters were evaluated: percentage of distance travelled in the novel compartment; number of attempts to enter the novel compartment; percentage of time spent in the novel compartment; and percentage of time rearing in the novel compartment. Subsequently, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the kappa index (κ) were calculated for each of these parameters. The ""percentage of time spent in the novel compartment"" (ICC. = 0.727; κ= 0.457), the ""percentage of distance travelled in the novel compartment"" (ICC. = 0.680; κ= 0.370), and the ""percentage of time rearing in the novel compartment"" (ICC. = 0.648; κ= 0.309) were found to be stable over time. Analysis of these parameters indicated fair to substantial reliability over time in two-month inter-trial interval.

This is important because if targeted by selection, such individual differences present the opportunity for an evolutionary response to selection. It is therefore necessary to examine whether hormone traits are repeatable in natural populations. However, research in this area is complicated by the fact that different hormone traits can be correlated. The nature of these trait correlations (i.e., phenotypic, within-, or among-individual) is critically relevant in terms of the evolutionary implications, and these in turn, depend on the repeatability of each hormone trait. By decomposing phenotypic correlations between hormone traits into their within- and among-individual components it is possible to describe the multivariate nature of endocrine traits and generate inferences about their evolution. In the present study, we repeatedly captured individual great tits (. Parus major) from a wild population and measured plasma concentrations of corticosterone. Using a mixed-modeling approach, we estimated repeatabilities in both initial (cf. baseline; CORT0) and stress-induced concentrations (CORT30) and the correlations between those traits among- and within-individuals. We found a lack of repeatability in both CORT0 and CORT30. Moreover, we found a strong phenotypic correlation between CORT0 and CORT30, and due to the lack of repeatability for both traits, there was no among-individual correlation between these two traits-i.e., an individual's average concentration of CORT0 was not correlated with its average concentration of CORT30. Instead, the phenotypic correlation was the result of a strong within-individual correlation, which implies that an underlying environmental factor co-modulates changes in initial and stress-induced concentrations within the same individual over time. These results demonstrate that (i) a phenotypic correlation between two hormone traits does not imply that the traits are correlated among individuals; (ii) the importance of repeated sampling to partition within- and among-individual variances and correlations among labile physiological traits; and (iii) that environmental factors explain a considerable fraction of the variation and co-variation in hormone concentrations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corticosterone; Endocrine stress response; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Multi-level variation; Repeatability; Variance partitioning","glucocorticoid; corticosterone; glucocorticoid; animal behavior; Article; behavior change; blood level; controlled study; coping behavior; ecological genetics; environmental factor; environmental stress; female; genetic trait; genotype environment interaction; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; nonhuman; Parus major; phenotype; stress; animal; biological model; blood; physiological stress; physiology; reproducibility; songbird; Animals; Corticosterone; Glucocorticoids; Models, Biological; Passeriformes; Phenotype; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Physiological","Baugh, A.T.; Swarthmore College, Martin Biological Laboratory, 500 College Avenue, United States",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,"25218170","English","Gen.

Spinal cord transection model is an ideal choice at present. Nevertheless, the operation is diverse, so therapeutic effects have great differences, and the research results lack of comparability. OBJECTIVE: To compare and analyze behavioral changes and pathological features of rat hindlimb after spinal cord transection by establishing standardized model of transected spinal cord in rats. METHODS: A total of 60 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham surgery group (n=12), conventional spinal cord transection group (n=24) and microscopic spinal cord transection group (n=24). Each group was randomly assigned to 7-day, 14-day and 28-day groups according to time points after model establishment. T9 vertebrae were considered as a center. Sham surgery group underwent laminectomy. Other groups underwent spinal cord transection. Thus, models of acute spinal cord injury were induced. Models in the conventional spinal cord transection group were established by conventional surgical methods. Models in the microscopic spinal cord transection group were established by standardization micromanipulation technique. At 7, 14 and 28 days after model establishment, motor function of hindlimb was evaluated using Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system. Histopathology of transected spinal cord was observed. The thickness of the glial scar, the longitudinal distance between the two stumps, the transverse diameter of the spinal cord cavity and cerebrospinal fluid cyst formation were measured at the transected site of the spinal cord. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In the sham surgery group, preoperative and postoperative BBB scores and pathology of the spinal cord did not clearly change. In the conventional spinal cord transection group and microscopic spinal cord transection group, complete paralysis of hindlimb was detected after model establishment. Hindlimb function did not recover in the conventional spinal cord transection group. At 1 to 2 weeks after model induction, spontaneous recovery of hindlimb function was visible in rats of the microscopic spinal cord transection group. Spinal pathology index value was significantly lower in the microscopic spinal cord transection group than in the conventional spinal cord transection group (P < 0.01). Pathological observations were not correlated with BBB scores in each group. These data indicated that standardized spinal cord transection method helps to eliminate individual differences and to quantitatively analyze and to compare studies addressing therapeutic effects. © 2014, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Age, sex, and morphological characteristics of birds may have an influence on their winter condition by affecting their foraging and competitive abilities. Winter body condition could have long-term consequences on the reproductive success of migratory birds during the subsequent breeding season. Using 3 yr of data from Collared Flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), we examined the characteristics of winter-grown tail feathers, as indicators of winter body condition, in relation to sex, age, morphological traits, and future breeding variables. Tail feather mass was highly repeatable between years, but feather growth rate was not repeatable, which suggests that the latter trait mainly indicates environmental circumstances during molt, whereas feather mass may more strongly reflect genetic effects. Tail feathers of males and adults showed better quality than those of females and juveniles, possibly because of differences between age classes and sexes in individual quality and foraging skills or because of winter habitat segregation. Birds with longer wings produced better-quality tail feathers, which suggests that wing and tail feather characteristics are similarly affected, presumably by individual genetic quality. Smaller Collared Flycatchers grew their tail feathers faster during the winter molt, possibly because they had better foraging ability due to better flight maneuverability. Tail feather quality showed no relationship with laying date; however, females that had produced heavier tail feathers during winter laid larger clutches during the following breeding season, which suggests that tail feather mass potentially reflects intrinsic individual quality. © 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.","Body condition; Clutch size; Ficedula albicollis; Migratory passerine; Plumage quality; Ptilochronology; Winter molt","age structure; body condition; breeding population; clutch size; juvenile; migratory species; molt; morphology; passerine; plumage; reproductive behavior; winter; Ficedula albicollis; Passeriformes","Hargitai, R.; Behavioral Ecology Group, Department of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, Eötvös Loránd UniversityHungary",,"University of California Press",00048038,,AUKJA,,"English","Auk",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908606432

However, issues surrounding the measurement of implementation climate, or the extent to which organizational members perceive that innovation use is expected, supported and rewarded by their organization remain. Specifically, it is unclear whether implementation climate can be measured as a global construct, whether individual or group-referenced items should be used, and whether implementation climate can be assessed at the group or organizational level.Methods: This research includes two cross-sectional studies with data collected via surveys at the individual level. The first study assessed the implementation climate perceptions of physicians participating in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), and the second study assessed the perceptions of children's behavioral health clinicians implementing a treatment innovation. To address if implementation climate is a global construct, we used confirmatory factor analysis. To address how implementation climate should be measured and at what level, we followed a five-step framework outlined by van Mierlo and colleagues. This framework includes exploratory factor analysis and correlations to assess differences between individual and group-referenced items and intraclass correlations, interrater agreements, and exploratory factor analysis to determine if implementation climate can be assessed at the organizational level.Results: The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that implementation climate is a global construct consisting of items related to expectations, support and rewards. There are mixed results, however, as to whether implementation climate should be measured using individual or group-referenced items. In our first study, where physicians were geographically dispersed and practice independently, there were no differences based on the type of items used, and implementation climate was an individual level construct. However, in the second study, in which clinicians practice in a central location and interact more frequently, group-referenced items may be appropriate.

Here we investigated how IIV in boldness (estimated by flight initiation distances) changed across two seasons-the dry, non-breeding season and the wet, breeding season-in a wild population of the Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps. We found significant differences in IIV both between individuals and seasons, and IIV was higher in the wet season, suggesting plasticity in IIV. Further, IIV was highly repeatable (r = 0.61) between seasons and we found strong negative correlations between consistent individual differences in flight initiation distances, i.e. their boldness, and individuals' IIVs.

Animals often modify their behaviours according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also retain consistent individual differences across environmental change (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal personality; Antipredator behaviour; Behavioural plasticity; Ground squirrel; Multidimensional plasticity; Urocitellus beldingi","antipredator defense; complexity; environmental conditions; individual variation; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; rodent","Dosmann, A.; Stanford University, Sweet Hall, 590 Escondido Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: dosmann1@gmail.com",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Methods: In 2009, the project on abuse of elderly in Europe (ABUEL) was conducted in seven cities (Stuttgart, Germany; Ancona, Italy; Kaunas, Lithuania, Stockholm, Sweden; Porto, Portugal; Granada, Spain; Athens, Greece) comprising 4467 individuals aged 60-84. years. We used a 3-level hierarchical structure of data: 1) characteristics of participants; 2) mean of tertiary education of each city; and 3) country inequality indicator (Gini coefficient). Multilevel logistic regression was used and proportional changes in Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were inspected to assert explained variance between models. Results: The prevalence of elder abuse showed large variations across sites. Adding tertiary education to the regression model reduced the country level variance for psychological abuse (ICC. = 3.4%), with no significant decrease in the explained variance for the other types of abuse. When the Gini coefficient was considered, the highest drop in ICC was observed for financial abuse (from 9.5% to 4.3%). Conclusion: There is a societal and community level dimension that adds information to individual variability in explaining country differences in elder abuse, highlighting underlying socioeconomic inequalities leading to such behavior. •A community dimension contributed to explain country differences in elder abuse.•Psychological abuse prevalence increased with education level of each city studied.•The country inequalities further explained country differences in financial abuse.•These findings might be of great relevance for public health preventive efforts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Elder abuse; Inequalities; Multinational study; Violence","adult; aged; analysis of variance; article; behavior disorder; community; controlled study; developing country; educational status; elder abuse; elderly care; Europe; female; general condition; human; income; logistic regression analysis; male; middle aged; population; prevalence; priority journal; psychological aspect; sexual abuse; social status; social work; socioeconomics; very elderly; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; demography; elder abuse; epidemiology; health disparity; multicenter study; social class; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Elder Abuse; Europe; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Social Class","Fraga, S.; Institute of Public Health, University of Porto (ISPUP), Rua das Taipas 135, 4050-600 Porto, Portugal; email: silfraga@med.up.pt",,,00917435,,PVTMA,"24440160","English","Prev.

The social niche specialization hypothesis predicts that repeated social interactions among individuals may generate among-individual differences and reinforce within-individual consistency through positive feedback mechanisms. Here, we test this hypothesis using groups of the social spider Stegodyphus mimosarum that differ in their level of familiarity. In support of the social niche specialization hypothesis, individuals in groups of spiders that were more familiar with each other showed greater repeatable among-individual variation in behaviour. Additionally, individuals that were more familiar with each other exhibited lower withinindividual variation in behaviour, providing one of the first examples of how the social environment can influence behavioural consistency. Our study demonstrates the potential for the social environment to generate and reinforce consistent individual differences in behaviour and provides a potentially general mechanism to explain this type of behavioural variation in animals with stable social groups. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We surveyed individual refuge use of mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat, and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size, crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately important influences on behavior (e.g., hunger) and that (2) individual behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be more repeatable over time. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Anti-predator; Behavioral syndrome; Body size; Crassostrea virginica; Personality; Phenotypic plasticity",,"Toscano, B.

Many studies focus on intraindividual repeatability, but few note population-wide trends in personality change. In part, this results from the large sample size that is required to detect such trends. In the present study, we measured personality in a large sample (N= 293) of adult, mother-reared pigtailed macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over a period of 3 years. We looked at four personality components (sociability towards humans, cautiousness, aggressiveness and fearfulness) derived from behavioural observations at two to four time points per subject. We found these components to have repeatabilities similar to those reported elsewhere in the literature. We then analysed population-wide changes in personality components over time using a linear mixed effects model with three predictors: entry age at the current primate facility, tenure at the primate facility at the time of the first personality test and time elapsed since the first personality test. We found that adult personality changed with life experiences (here, tenure at the facility where tested) and age. Throughout adulthood, pigtailed macaques became less cautious and more aggressive. At the same time, subjects became less cautious and more sociable with increasing time in individual caging at the current primate research facility. We also found that individuals differed significantly in their personality consistency. Other researchers may benefit by applying similar methodology to that described here as they extrapolate about personality measures over time. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Change; Macaca nemestrina; Personality; Pigtailed macaque; Repeatability; Stability; Temperament","adult; age; aggression; captive breeding; population structure; primate; research work; social behavior; stabilization","Sussman, A.F.; Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Guthrie Hall, Box 351525, Seattle, WA 98195, United States; email: adris@u.washington.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

However there is much overlap between the two fields, both aiming to measure the causes and consequences of consistent individual behaviour. Here for the first time we use both a classic measure of personality, the response to a novel object, and an estimate of foraging strategy, derived from GPS data, to examine individual personality differences in black browed albatross and their consequences for fitness. First, we examine the repeatability of personality scores and link these to variation in foraging habitat. Bolder individuals forage nearer the colony, in shallower regions, whereas shyer birds travel further from the colony, and fed in deeper oceanic waters. Interestingly, neither personality score predicted a bird's overlap with fisheries. Second, we show that both personality scores are correlated with fitness consequences, dependent on sex and year quality. Our data suggest that shyer males and bolder females have higher fitness, but the strength of this relationship depends on year quality. Females who forage further from the colony have higher breeding success in poor quality years, whereas males foraging close to the colony always have higher fitness. Together these results highlight the potential importance of personality variation in seabirds and that the fitness consequences of boldness and foraging strategy may be highly sex dependent. © 2014 Patrick, Weimerskirch.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; article; breeding success; controlled study; deep sea species; female; fitness; foraging behavior; habitat selection; male; nonhuman; organism colony; personality; scoring system; seabird; sex difference; telemetry; Thalassarche melanophrys; animal; Antarctica; feeding behavior; geography; longevity; personality; physiology; principal component analysis; reproductive fitness; songbird; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Feeding Behavior; Female; Genetic Fitness; Geography; Longevity; Male; Passeriformes; Personality; Principal Component Analysis",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"24504180","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895134968

We collected observational data for 108 adult females living in three social groups in a free-ranging population via focal animal sampling. We applied principal component analysis to nine spontaneously occurring behaviors and identified six putative personality components, which we named Meek, Bold, Aggressive, Passive, Loner, and Nervous. All components were repeatable and heritable, with heritability estimates ranging from 0.14 to 0.35. We found no evidence of an association with reproductive output, measured either by infant survival or by interbirth interval, for any of the personality components. This finding suggests either that personality does not have fitness-related consequences in this population or that selection has acted to reduce fitness-associated variation in personality. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Additive genetic variance; Behavioral tendencies; Fitness; Quantitative genetics; Reproductive success",,"Brent, L.

However, at present rideability is evaluated rather subjectively in breeding horse performance tests. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role horse behaviour as well as degree and quality of rein tension might play in judges' evaluation of horses' rideability. Mares (n = 33) and stallions (n = 13) from two different mare- and one stallion-testing station were observed twice during their performance test dressage training. During these rides, rein tension was measured continuously, and frequency of behaviour patterns such as head-tossing, tail swishing, and snorting was recorded. Rein tension parameters showed reasonable repeatabilities within horse-rider pairs (e.g. mean rein tension: r2 = 0.61±0.11; variance of rein tension: r2 = 0.52±0.14). Regression analysis revealed that a larger proportion of variance in rideability scores could be explained by maximum (17%), mean (16%) and variance (15%) of rein tension compared to horses' or riders' behavioural parameters (tail-swishing: 5% and rider's use of hands: 5%, respectively). According to mixed model analysis, rideability scores dropped (all P&lt;0.05) with increasing mean, maximum and variability in rein tension (e.g. -0.37±0.14 scores per additional 10 Newton in mean tension). However, mean rein tension differed between testing stations (P&lt;0.0001) ranging between 9.1±1.6 N in one station and 21.7±1.3 N in another station. These results indicate that quantity and consistency of rein tension is either directly or indirectly an important factor for judges to derive rideability scores. Given the importance of rein tension parameters to both rider comfort and horse welfare, potentially, measurements of rein tension along with behaviour observations assessing the quality of rein contact (e.g. distinguishing a light contact from attempts to evade contact) might be used to make the assessment of rideability more impartial. © 2014 König von Borstel, Glißmann.",,"animal behavior; animal welfare; article; character; comfort; female; gait; horse; horse performance test; male; nonhuman; performance; personality; quality control; rein tension; rideability; scoring system; temperament; tension; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Handling (Psychology); Horses; Male; Recreation; Reproducibility of Results",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"24489890","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900314736

Whereas the first part describes the methodology in detail, this part proposes a thorough evaluation of the approach by applying it to a sample of laboratory sleep recordings. New method: The tested methodology is based on the alignment of time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels and is used for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive EEG. Results: Spindle propagation displays features that suggest wave displacements of global synaptic potential fields. Propagation patterns that are coherent (as opposed to random), laterally symmetrical, and highly repeatable within and between subjects were observed. Propagation was slower from posterior to anterior and from central to lateral brain regions than in the opposite directions. Propagation speeds varying between 2.3 and 7.0. m/s were obtained. A distinct grouping of propagation properties was noted for a small cluster of frontal electrodes. No propagation between distantly separated scalp locations was observed. The values of spindle characteristics such as average frequency, RMS amplitude, frequency slope, and duration, depend largely on propagation direction but are only mildly correlated with propagation delay. Comparison with existing method(s): Results obtained are in line with many results published in the literature and offer new measures for describing sleep spindle behavior. Conclusions: Propagation properties provide new information about sleep spindle behavior and thus allow more precise automated assessments of spindle-related functions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Amplitude; Duration; Electroencephalography; Frequency; Propagation; Sleep spindle; Time delay","adult; article; Beck Depression Inventory; brain region; electrocardiogram; electrode; electroencephalogram; electromagnetic radiation; electromyogram; electrooculogram; Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; female; human; male; nonREM sleep; normal human; priority journal; reliability; REM sleep; scalp; sleep spindle; sleep stage; synaptic potential; Toronto Alexithymia scale; Amplitude; Duration; Electroencephalography; Frequency; Propagation; Sleep spindle; Time delay; Adult; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sleep; Sleep Stages; Software; Young Adult","O'Reilly, C.; Dream and Nightmare Laboratory, Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, HÔpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, 5400 boulevard Gouin Ouest Montréal, QC H4J 1C5, Canada; email: christian.oreilly@umontreal.ca",,"Elsevier",01650270,,JNMED,"23999173","English","J.

Although theory is rapidly developing in this area, there are few empirical tests. There are at least two hypotheses to explain why individuals behave differently from one another in a dynamic social environment. The social niche specialization hypothesis proposes that repeated social interactions generate consistent individual differences in social behaviour. The behavioural type hypothesis proposes that an individual's social behaviour reflects its behavioural type. We tested these two hypotheses by manipulating the opportunity for repeated social interactions in groups of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and by measuring the behavioural types of the same individuals in three contexts: when in a novel environment, when presented with an opportunity to associate with conspecifics and when confronted by an intruder. We found no evidence that repeated social interactions increased between-individual variation in social foraging behaviour. Instead, individuals' social foraging behaviour was related to their behavioural type, specifically their shoaling behaviour. In addition, the behavioural types of the members of a group strongly influenced a group's average foraging behaviour. Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that social dynamics within groups generates individual differences in behaviour. Instead, they suggest the reverse: individual differences in behaviour drive group-level dynamics. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural type; Consistent individual differences; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Repeatability; Social niche; Social specialization; Threespine stickleback","behavioral ecology; conspecific; foraging behavior; individual variation; niche; social behavior; specialization; teleost","Laskowski, K.L.; Department of Biology and Ecology of Fishes, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; email: kate.laskowski@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Such differences are stable and trait-like, but it is not clear whether these findings generalize to physiologic responses to sleep loss. Here, we analyzed individual differences in behavioral and physiologic measures in healthy ethnic-Chinese male volunteers (n = 12; aged 22–30 years) who were kept awake for at least 26 h in a controlled laboratory environment on two separate occasions. Every 2 h, sustained attention performance was assessed using a 10-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and sleepiness was estimated objectively by determining percentage eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS) and blink rate. Between-subject differences in heart rate and its variability, and electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power were also analyzed during each PVT. To assess stability of individual differences, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were determined using variance components analysis. Consistent with previous work, individual differences in PVT performance were reproducible across study visits, as were baseline sleep measures prior to sleep deprivation. In addition, stable individual differences were observed during sleep deprivation for PERCLOS, blink rate, heart rate and its variability, and EEG spectral power in the alpha frequency band, even after adjusting for baseline differences in these measures (range, ICC = 0.67–0.91). These findings establish that changes in ocular, ECG, and EEG signals are highly reproducible across a night of sleep deprivation, hence raising the possibility that, similar to behavioral measures, physiologic responses to sleep loss are trait-like. © 2014 The Authors.","Circadian; EEG; Performance; Sleep","actimetry; adult; Article; behavior; body temperature monitoring; circadian rhythm; electrocardiogram; electroencephalogram; eyelid closure; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; male; normal human; physiology; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; psychomotor performance; pupillography; questionnaire; retrospective study; sleep deprivation; somnolence; spectroscopy; visual analog scale","Gooley, J.J.; Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, 8 College Road, Singapore; email: joshua.gooley@duke-nus.edu.sg",,"American Physiological Society",2051817X,,,,"English","Physiol.

We have little knowledge of the long-term (as opposed to short-term) consistency of personality and the relationships between personality and behavioural flexibility in wild, free-living animals. This study investigates personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour) and contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in behaviour between contexts) of these traits in the Nazca booby (Sula granti), a long-lived, free-living seabird. We tested birds for personality in the field, during incubation, using a human intruder test, two novel object tests, and a social stimulus test (mirror), and determined repeatability of behavioural traits both within-season (short-term) and between several years (long-term). We found high short- and long-term repeatability of aggressive and anxietyrelated behaviours when confronted with a nest intruder and novel objects, but lower repeatability during social stimulation. Contextual plasticity was highly repeatable across years for aggressive behaviours, and low for anxiety-related behaviours. Plasticity did not correlate across behaviours into a 'meta-personality' trait. Contextual plasticity in behavioural traits was highly correlated with the expression of those traits, suggesting that individuals are able to both react strongly and modify their behaviour depending on context, perhaps due to consistent differences in individual quality. Model selection exercises using structural equation models evaluated the relationships between personality factors, indicating a behavioural syndrome in which anxiety- or agitation-related behaviours covary strongly and positively, and both covary weakly and negatively with aggression. © Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","behavioural syndrome; Nazca booby (Sula granti); personality; plasticity; seabird",,"Grace, J.K.; Department of Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston Hall, 1834 Wake Forest Rd., Winston-Salem, NC 27109, United States; email: gracjk7@wfu.edu",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905234151

Such foraging specialisations are common among marine vertebrates, yet it is not clear how individuals repeatedly locate prey or foraging sites at ocean-wide scales. Using GPS and time-depth loggers we studied the fine-scale foraging behaviour of central-place northern gannets Morus bassanus at two large colonies. First, we estimated the degree of consistency in individual foraging routes and sites across repeated trips. Second, we tested for individual differences in searching behaviour in response to environmental covariates using reaction norms, estimated from mixed effect models. Adult gannets tracked over multiple foraging trips showed repeatable between-individual differences in terminal points and departure angles of foraging trips, but low repeatability in trip duration and trip length. Importantly, individual birds showed highly repeatable dive locations, with consistently different environmental conditions (such as copepod abundance), suggesting a high degree of foraging site specialisation. Gannets also showed between-individual differences in searching behaviour along environmental gradients, such that individuals intensified searching under different conditions. Together these results suggest that widespread individual foraging consistency may represent specialisation and be linked with individual responses to environmental conditions. Such divergent searching behaviour could provide a mechanism by which consistent foraging behaviour arises and is maintained among animals that forage across large spatial scales. © 2013 The Authors.",,"behavioral response; colony structure; environmental conditions; environmental constraint; foraging behavior; GPS; intrapopulation variation; marine ecosystem; predator; specialization; vertebrate; Animalia; Aves; Copepoda; Morus (bird); Morus bassanus; Sulidae; Vertebrata","Patrick, S.C.; Biosciences QU116, Univ. og Gloucestershire, Francis Close Hall Campus, Cheltenham, GL50 4AZ, United Kingdom; email: spatrick@glos.ac.uk",,,00301299,,OIKSA,,"English","Oikos",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890799987

Individual behaviour, however, may be constrained by between-individual variability in energy metabolism and may become unstable owing to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Here we tested the relationship between personality and physiology using wild-caught bank voles, Myodes glareolus, that varied according to mtDNA type (original or introgressed from Myodes rutilus). Personality traits and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals' consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however, this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the alternative compensation model. According to our findings, it is likely that consistent differences in behavioural patterns and mtDNA types promote variation between individuals in energy metabolism. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bank vole; BMR; Introgression; Mitochondria; Myodes (Clethrionomys) glareolus; Personality","fitness; individual variation; introgression; life history trait; metabolism; mitochondrial DNA; physiology; rodent","Boratyński, Z.; University of Porto, CIBIO, Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources, Campus Agrário de Vairao, R.

Moreover, the maintenance of honest signaling should be enhanced by the existence of consistent individual differences in behavior and performance, and individual-level correlations between them. Despite this, researchers studying honest signaling rarely measure behavioral repeatability. Here, we demonstrate that field behaviors of free-ranging lizards and a measure of locomotor performance in the laboratory are consistent among individuals (i.e. they were repeatable), although the magnitude of repeatability varies among traits. In addition, endurance appears to be correlated with display frequency in the field at the individual level, suggesting that display frequency is an honest signal of endurance. Interestingly, this correlation was strong for males, and non-existent for females. Our results extend previous studies of behavior-performance relationships by identifying a sex-specific correlation between traits and by partitioning phenotypic correlations into between- and within-individual components.

Social niche specialization, coupled with role-specific life-history trade-offs, should thus generate between-individual differences in behaviour that persist through time, or distinct personalities, as individuals specialize in particular nonoverlapping social roles. We tested for support for the social niche specialization hypothesis in cooperative personality traits in wild female meerkats (Suricata suricatta) that compete for access to dominant social roles. As cooperation is costly and dominance is acquired by heavier females, we predicted that females that ultimately acquired dominant roles would show noncooperative personality types early in life and before and after role acquisition. Although we found large individual differences in repeatable cooperative behaviours, there was no indication that individuals that ultimately acquired dominance differed from unsuccessful individuals in their cooperative behaviour. Early-life behaviour did not predict social role acquisition later in life, nor was cooperative behaviour before and after role acquisition correlated in the same individuals. We suggest that female meerkats do not show social niche specialization resulting in cooperative personalities, but that they exhibit an adaptive response in personality at role acquisition. © 2014 The Authors.","Animal personality; Cooperation; Life history; Social niche specialization; Suricata suricatta","adaptation; dominance; female; life history trait; niche; physiological response; small mammal; social conflict; specialization; trade-off; wild population; Animalia; Suricata suricatta; animal; biological model; cooperation; female; mongoose; physiology; psychology; social dominance; Animals; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Herpestidae; Models, Biological; Social Dominance","Carter, A.J.; Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, United Kingdom; email: ac854@cam.ac.uk",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",1010061X,,JEBIE,"24666630","English","J.

This concept is important for any study of behaviour, as all traits of evolutionary interest must be repeatable in order to respond to selection. We investigated the repeatability of behavioural responses to experimental brood parasitism in American robins, a robust (100%) rejecter of parasitic brown-headed cowbird eggs. Because tests of repeatability require variation between individuals, we parasitized the same robin nests twice successively with model eggs dyed with colours known to elicit rejection at intermediate rates (58-70%).We calculated the repeatability of responses to parasitism, and used a generalized linear mixed model to also test for potentially confounding effects of ordinal date, presentation order, and clutch size. We found that repeatability in response to brood parasitism in this host species is high, and the best model predicting responses to sequential artificial parasitism includes only nest identity. This result is consistent with a critical assumption about egg rejection in this cowbird host as an evolved adaptation in response to brood parasitism. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","American robin; brood parasitism; brown-headed cowbird; repeatability",,"Croston, R.; Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behaviour Subprogram in Biology, Graduate Center of the City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10065, United States; email: RCroston@gc.cuny.edu",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899058913

This raises questions about the relative importance of individual consistency versus flexibility in the evolution of migration strategies, and has implications for the ability of populations to respond to climatic change. Using geolocators, we tracked the migrations of Scopoli’s shearwaters Calonectris diomedea breeding in Linosa (Italy) across three years, and analysed timing and spatial aspects of their movements. Birds showed remarkable variation in their main wintering destination along the western coast of Africa. We found significant individual consistency in the total distance traveled, time spent in transit, and time that individuals spent in the wintering areas. We found extensive sex differences in scheduling, duration, distances and destinations of migratory journeys. We also found sex differences in the degree of individual consistency in aspects of migration behaviour. Despite strong evidence for individual consistency, which indicates that migration journeys from the same bird tended to be more similar than those of different birds, there remained substantial intra-individual variation between years. Indeed, we also found clear annual differences in departure dates, return dates, wintering period, the total distance traveled and return routes from wintering grounds back to the colony. These findings show that this population flexibly shifts migration schedules as well as routes between years in response to direct or indirect effects of heterogeneity in the environment, while maintaining consistent individual migration strategies. © 2014 Current Zoology.","Avian migration; GLS loggers; Individual strategies; Repeatability",,"Müller, M.S.; Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Nagoya UniversityJapan",,"Chinese Academy of Sciences",16745507,,TWHPA,,"English","Curr.

However, how exposure affects behavioral consistency over time is not commonly addressed. To examine the effects of chronic EE2 exposure on behavioral consistency, adult male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, received multiple trials with a dummy male and dummy female presented simultaneously both before and after chronic exposure to a nominal dose (10 ng/l) of EE2. The responses of exposed males were compared before and after exposure and against those of a group of unexposed, control males. Male-directed and female-directed behaviors were reduced after 28 days of EE2 exposure. More importantly, chronic EE2 exposure had dramatic effects on consistent individual differences in female-directed and male-directed behaviors. Repeatability values were markedly lower and level of response was less correlated in the EE2 group, suggesting that exposure disrupts both between-individual variation and behavioral consistency. These results cannot be explained by a temporal effect as they were not found in the control group of unexposed males. This study demonstrates that EE2 exposure may have effects beyond a reduction in overall response. It also demonstrates the importance of studying the effects of chemical exposure on multiple time scales as acute exposure to EE2 affects the consistency of only female-directed behaviors in this species whereas chronic exposure affects consistency of both female-directed and male-directed behavior. Finally, this study suggests that males in this species may differ in their sensitivity, an important area for future research. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","consistent individual differences; decision-making; endocrine disrupting chemicals; repeatability; Siamese fighting fish; social interactions",,"Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, Biddeford, ME, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,"Brill Academic Publishers",00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896979614

These differences can involve consistent variation in the level of a particular behaviour (personality) or differences in the way individuals adjust their behaviour to environmental gradients (plasticity). In prey species, feeding rates and vigilance vary with environmental, social and individual factors and the feeding rate/vigilance relationship reflects the trade-off between food acquisition and safety. While feeding rates and vigilance have been shown to vary between individuals in relation to group size and predation risk, how they relate to other factors has not yet been investigated, nor has between-individual variation in this trade-off. We studied between-individual variation in vigilance, feeding rates and their trade-off in female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, to see whether females showed consistent behavioural differences and different plasticity in relation to ecological (food patch richness), social (group sizes) and physiological (reproductive states) conditions. We addressed two contrasting hypotheses: an 'ecological' hypothesis under which individuals facing the same conditions should behave similarly, and a 'behavioural' hypothesis under which they should behave differently because of their own personality or plasticity. Female kangaroos tended to adjust their behaviours similarly in relation to ecological and social conditions, supporting the ecological hypothesis. However, they also showed differences in personality and plasticity in relation to their reproductive states that could not be explained by energetic demand alone this was suggestive of different maternal strategies, thus supporting the behavioural hypothesis. Altogether these results suggest that consistent differences in animals' personality and behavioural plasticity can be promoted by physiological conditions and are not necessarily repeatable across different ecological contexts. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural plasticity; Feeding rate; Herbivore; Kangaroo; Macropus giganteus; Personality; Vigilance",,"Pays, O.; Groupe Ecologie et Conservation, Université d'Angers, Campus Belle Beille, 2 Bd Lavoisier, 49045 Angers, France; email: olivier.pays@univ-angers.fr",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Fourty-two steers were weighed individually in a scale (2.5x3x2.5m) to assess two behavioural parameters: crush test and exit velocity. Repeatability of the behavioural responses during 3 weighing events was calculated and a consistency scale was created to determine consistency of the parameters. Blood samples were collected from each steer after the second crush test and at bleeding, then analyzed for serum cortisol. Bruising and pH were registered after slaughter on the carcasses. Crush score was highly consistent (r = 0.81-0.87) and exit velocity moderately consistent (r = 0.44-0.60), however individual differences were detected in the ""acclimation"" and ""sensitization"" to the test through time. Higher crush score was associated with higher on farm cortisol concentration. Steers producing carcasses with multiple bruises (3-4) had a higher serum cortisol concentration at bleeding (P < 0.05) than steers with less carcass bruising. Behavioural parameters, carcass bruising and meat pH were not statistically associated. We conclude that it is important to evaluate behavioural reactivity using serial tests and we recommend further exploration on the capacity of reactivity tests to detect differences in reactivity that can be reflected in differences in meat quality parameters. © 2014, Universidad Austral de Chile.

Repeatability (R) of different aspects of energy metabolism and behavior has been demonstrated in a variety of organisms over short and long time intervals. Recent research suggests that consistent individual differences in behavior and energy metabolism might covary. Here we present new data on the repeatability of body mass, standard metabolic rate (SMR), voluntary exploratory behavior, and feeding rate in a semiaquatic salamander and ask whether individual variation in behavioral traits is correlated with individual variation in metabolism on a whole-animal basis and after conditioning on body mass. All measured traits were repeatable, but the repeatability estimates ranged from very high for body mass (R = 0.98), to intermediate for SMR (R = 0.39) and food intake (R = 0.58), to low for exploratory behavior (R = 0.25). Moreover, repeatability estimates for all traits except body mass declined over time (i.e., from 3 to 9 wk), although this pattern could be a consequence of the relatively low sample size used in this study. Despite significant repeatability in all traits, we find little evidence that behaviors are correlated with SMR at the phenotypic and among-individual levels when conditioned on body mass. Specifically, the phenotypic correlations between SMR and exploratory behavior were negative in all trials but significantly so in one trial only. Salamanders in this study showed individual variation in how their exploratory behavior changed across trials (but not body mass, SMR, and feed intake), which might have contributed to observed changing correlations across trials. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.",,"behavioral ecology; body mass; correlation; feeding behavior; genetic analysis; metabolism; phenotypic plasticity; reptile; animal; basal metabolic rate; body weight; eating; energy metabolism; exploratory behavior; feeding behavior; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; Urodela; Animals; Basal Metabolism; Body Weight; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Exploratory Behavior; Feeding Behavior; Phenotype; Urodela","Gifford, M.

Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study, overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g. lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and, at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual performance change significantly between data sets. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Boldness; I matrix; Multivariate behaviour; Personality; Repeatability; Stability","behavioral ecology; captive breeding; cyprinid; data set; emergence; freshwater environment; matrix; multivariate analysis; observational method; phenotype; stabilization; timescale; Animalia; Archosargus probatocephalus; Poeciliidae; Xiphophorus birchmanni","Wilson, A.

However, previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding the degree of school-level variation for health outcomes, particularly for risk behaviours. This study uses data from three large longitudinal studies in England to investigate school-level variation in a range of health indicators. Participants were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, the Me and My School Study and the Research with East London Adolescent Community Health Survey. Outcome variables included risk behaviours (smoking, alcohol/cannabis use, sexual behaviour), behavioural difficulties and victimisation, obesity and physical activity, mental and emotional health, and educational attainment. Multi-level models were used to calculate the proportion of variance in outcomes explained at school level, expressed as intraclass correlations (ICCs) adjusted for gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status of the participants. ICCs for health outcomes ranged from nearly nil to .28 and were almost uniformly lower than for attainment (.17-.23). Most adjusted ICCs were smaller than unadjusted values, suggesting that school-level variation partly reflects differences in pupil demographics. School-level variation was highest for risk behaviours. ICCs were largely comparable across datasets, as well as across years within datasets, suggesting that school-level variation in health remains fairly constant across adolescence. School-level variation in health outcomes remains significant after adjustment for individual demographic differences between schools, confirming likely effects for school environment. Variance is highest for risk behaviours, supporting the utility of school environment interventions for these outcomes. © 2013 Society for Prevention Research.","Adolescence; Health behaviour; Health promotion; Multilevel modelling; Substance use","adolescent; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; school; social class; United Kingdom; Adolescent; England; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Schools; Social Class","Hale, D.

We explored whether a behavioral syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during 2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1) hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38% repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation. Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this heterogeneity. © The Author 2013.

Recently, it has been suggested that parasites may have a crucial role in shaping animal personalities, but only a very few studies have experimentally tested the idea. We infected Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus ) with the brain-encysted trematode parasite, Diplostomum phoxini , and studied whether infection could modify the personality of their hosts. Our results show that D. phoxini infection did not affect the mean levels of boldness, activity or exploration, but infected minnows showed higher repeatability in boldness and activity, and reduced repeatability in exploration.We also found that D. phoxini may be able to break the associations (behavioral syndromes) between behavioral traits, but that this effect may be dependent on parasite intensity. Furthermore, the effect of D. phoxini infection on personality of the hosts was found to be nonlinearly dependent on infection intensity. Taken together, our results suggest that D. phoxini parasites may shape the personality of their hosts, but that behavioral consequences of ecologically relevant infection levels may be rather subtle and easily remain undetected if only the mean trait expressions are compared. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Activity; Boldness; Exploration; Parasite; Personality; Phoxinus phoxinus","behavioral response; brain; cyprinid; exploration; gene expression; parasite; Animalia; Cyprinidae; Diplostomum phoxini; Phoxinus phoxinus; Trematoda","Kekäläinen, J.; Department of Biology, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

We tested for the existence of such a syndrome in wild-caught captive greenfinches. We assessed the propensity to give distress calls at handling, latency to feed at the presence of a predator image, and changes in locomotor activity in response to distress calls of conspecifics. Additionally, we measured the frequency of flapping flight movements against cage bars and tendency to damage tail feathers in captivity as indicators of the ability of birds to cope with captive conditions. As a proxy of neuroendocrine activity (an expected covariate of fearfulness), we measured the amount of stress hormone corticosterone deposited into feathers grown during captivity. All the behavioral traits were individually repeatable in time, but there were no correlations between them. Lack of the behavioral syndrome for fearfulness was also revealed by structural equation modelling. The findings of this experiment challenge the concept of a single internal variable responsible for fearfulness and support the proposed multidimensional nature of fear responses. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioral syndrome; Fearfulness; Feather corticosterone; Greenfinch; Stress; Structural equation modelling","calling behavior; captivity; conspecific; covariance analysis; hormone; locomotion; passerine; wild population; Aves; Carduelis chloris","Sepp, T.; Institute of Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Tartu, Vanemuise 46, Tartu, 51014, Estonia; email: tuul.sepp@ut.ee",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

We found that house cricket exploratory behavior was highly repeatable in two populations (repeatability: 0.37-0.51). However, exploratory behavior across two different testing methods was not strongly correlated (r = -0.17 to 0.14).

Yet, it is unclear how body size and ovarian development influence worker personalities (i.e. consistent behavioral variation) and task allocation in similar aged ant workers of monomorphic species. Behavioral variation is thought to be a key element of division of labor, but few studies have linked worker personality to task allocation. We investigated individual behavior in Leptothorax acervorum ant workers at two time points during the first three months of their life and in two different settings. We observed worker behavior in the nest (i.e. task allocation) and in standardized aggression, exploration and brood care experiments (i.e. personality) and found behavioral repeatability in foraging and exploration. Further, workers acted consistently across settings: workers with a more aggressive and exploratory personality type were more active in the nest. Moreover, ovarian development was associated with worker personality and task allocation: older workers with well-developed ovaries foraged less, but were more aggressive and exploratory. In accordance with the typical age-polyethism of social insects, workers became more active and foraged more as they grew older. Consequently, our study suggests that task allocation in Leptothorax acervorum is not only influenced by ovarian development and age, but moreover by the personalities of its workers. © 2014 Current Zoology.","Behavioral syndrome; Division of labor; Foraging; Ovarian development; Personality; Social insects",,"Modlmeier, A.

However, while the foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality. Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Animal personality; Behavioral syndromes; Repeatability; Thermal ecology; Trap-building predators","behavioral ecology; decadal variation; decision making; habitat selection; insect; larva; soil type; Animalia; Hexapoda","Alcalay, Y.; Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the NegevIsrael",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Such a link implies that the within-individual consistency in the same behavior has a genetic basis. Behavioral consistency is also prevalent in the form of between-individual correlation of functionally different behaviors; thus, the relationship between DRD4 polymorphism and exploration may also be manifested for other behaviors. Here, in a Hungarian population of the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, we investigate how males with distinct DRD4 genotypes differ in the consistent elements of their behavioral displays during the courtship period. In completely natural conditions, we assayed novelty avoidance, aggression and risk-taking, traits that were previously shown repeatable over time and correlate with each other, suggesting that they could have a common mechanistic basis. We identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP554 and SNP764) in the exon 3 of the DRD4 gene by sequencing a subsample, then we screened 202 individuals of both sexes for these SNPs. Focusing on the genotypic variation in courting males, we found that ""AC"" heterozygote individuals at the SNP764 take lower risk than the most common ""AA"" homozygotes (the ""CC"" homozygotes were not represented in our subsample of males). We also found a considerable effect size for the relationship between SNP554 polymorphism and novelty avoidance. Therefore, in addition to exploration, DRD4 polymorphisms may also be associated with the regulation of behaviors that may incur fear or stress. Moreover, polymorphisms at the two SNPs were not independent indicating a potential role for genetic constraints or another functional link, which may partially explain behavioral correlations. © 2014 The Authors.

To estimate the evolvability and adaptability of individually consistent behavioral variation, there is a crucial need to quantify the genetics underlying personality. Here, we experimentally studied the repeatability of various individual behaviors and then estimated heritability of formed boldness, exploration, and aggression components in juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta in standardized laboratory environment. Principal component analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low level (h 2 = 0.142 ± 0.096). These results suggest that additive genetic variation underlies phenotypically consistent behavioral patterns, proposing that any selection acting on behavior, stress tolerance, or correlated traits has a potential to induce evolution in fish personality. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Boldness; Fish; Hatchery; Heritable components; Personality; Salmo trutta","behavioral ecology; functional role; genetic variation; hatchery; heritability; individual variation; juvenile; natural selection; phenotype; salmonid; Animalia; Salmo trutta","Kortet, R.; Department of Biology, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

Personality traits also affect habitat choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping), both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our prediction was supported: bold females [short flight initiation distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"behavioral response; bird; body condition; body temperature; breeding; female; fitness; incubation; life history trait; microclimate; selection; survival; trade-off; Anas; Aves; Somateria mollissima","Seltmann, M.W.; ARONIA Coastal Zone Research Team, Åbo Akademi University and Novia University of Applied Sciences, Raseborgsvägen 9, FI-10600 Ekenäs, Finland; email: martin.seltmann@novia.fi",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890123847

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of SCL CSQ (SCL CSQ-T) in persons with SCI.Methods:One hundred persons with SCI were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with SCL CSQ-T and Brief Coping Styles Inventory (BCSI) at the baseline. SCL CSQ-T was repeated twice in 15 days. American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and Functional Independence Measurement were used for the evaluation of the neurological loss severity and functional status. Emotional status was assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability and construct validity of SCL CSQ-T were evaluated.Results:Intraclass correlation coefficients of the SCL CSQ-T were between 0.51-0.86. Cronbach's alpha values and test-retest reliability of the acceptance, fighting spirit and social reliance subscales were good. Three factors were found in exploratory factor analysis. There was a positive correlation between the subscales of SCL CSQ-T. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between acceptance strategy of SCL CSQ-T and self-confidence and optimism of BCSI. The fighting spirit strategy positively correlated with self-confidence and optimistic strategies. The social reliance strategy positively correlated with helplessness and seeking social support. Coping strategies did not correlate with HADS.Conclusion:The results of this study revealed good internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the SCL CSQ-T factors acceptance and fighting spirit in relation to general coping strategies.

Fear tests are also used as part of welfare assessment programmes. Little is known about fear responses of turkeys. Specifically, it is unknown whether turkeys' fear responses are reliable which is important when developing tests for assessing welfare. This study examined the short- (between days) and long-term (between weeks) changes in, and test-retest reliability of, turkeys' fear responses. Male commercial turkeys were housed in groups of four to six in 16 pens. Turkeys were individually tested in OF (n=60) and TI (n=66) tests. VA and NO tests were administered to groups of turkeys in their pens (n=16). Turkeys were tested three times in each test. The first (Period 1) and second (Period 2) tests were administered on consecutive days between 4 and 6 weeks, and the third test (Period 3) between 8 and 10 weeks. Other than increased sitting and reduced standing during OF testing and more birds approaching and pecking the observer during VA testing (Period 2 vs. 1), frequencies of responses did not differ between test periods. However, test responses (e.g. latencies to ambulate, vocalise, approach and peck) differed between periods depending on the fear test used. All VA test measures differed between periods, whereas most TI test measures did not. Most OF and NO test measures differed between weeks, but not between days. Except for the number of vocalisations (rS=0.39), most OF test responses were moderately reliable (rS&gt;0.40). The latency to vocalise (rS≥0.51) and number of vocalisations (rS≥0.59) were the most reliable TI test measures, whereas reliability of TI duration (rS≤0.31) was low. All VA test measures were moderately to highly repeatable between days and weeks (e.g. latency to peck: rS≥0.67). Reliability was lowest for the NO test, where only the latency to peck was moderately repeatable (rS=0.61). These findings suggest that although some fear responses of turkeys change over time and with repeated testing, most OF, TI and VA responses are reliable between days and weeks. However, few NO test measures were reliable under the conditions of this study. Further research is needed to assess the validity of OF, TI, VA and NO tests for assessing fear responses of turkeys. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Animal welfare; Fear tests; Fearfulness; Temperament; Turkeys","animal welfare; assessment method; behavioral response; frequency analysis; poultry; vocalization; Animalia; Aves","Swanson, J.; Michigan State University, 474 S.

The Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R) is frequently used in mental health evaluations in these cases to aid legal decision making. Although generally perceived to be a useful assessment tool in applied settings, recent research has raised questions about the reliability of PCL-R scores in SVP cases. In this report, we review the use of the PCL-R in SVP trials identified as part of a larger project investigating its role in U.S. case law. After presenting data on how the PCL-R is used in SVP cases, we examine the reliability of scores reported in these cases. We located 214 cases involving the PCL-R, 88 of which included an actual score and 29 of which included multiple scores. In the 29 cases with multiple scores, the intraclass correlation coefficient for a single evaluator for the PCL-R scores was only.58, and only 41.4% of the difference scores were within 1 standard error of measurement unit. The average score reported by prosecution experts was significantly higher than the average score reported by defense-retained experts, and prosecution experts reported PCL-R scores of 30 or above in nearly 50% of the cases, compared with less than 10% of the cases for defense witnesses (κ =.29). In conjunction with other recently published findings demonstrating the unreliability of PCL-R scores in applied settings, our results raise questions as to whether this instrument should be admitted into SVP proceedings. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","civil commitment; PCL-R; psychopathy; reliability; sexually violent predator","antisocial personality disorder; checklist; expert witness; forensic psychiatry; human; legislation and jurisprudence; prisoner; psychology; psychometry; recurrent disease; reproducibility; sexual crime; statistics; statistics and numerical data; United States; validation study; violence; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Checklist; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Dangerous Behavior; Expert Testimony; Humans; Prisoners; Psychometrics; Recurrence; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Offenses; Statistics as Topic; United States","DeMatteo, D.; Department of Psychology, Earle Mack School of Law, Drexel University, MS 626, 246 North 15th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102, United States; email: david.dematteo@drexel.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",01477307,,LHBED,"24127888","English","Law Hum.

The first two lines of defence, aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency to these responses did not correlate with any of the female defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately, this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence behaviour against adult brood parasites in general. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Brood parasitism; Discrimination; Mating status; Personality; Recognition",,"Trnka, A.; Department of Biology, University of Trnava, Priemyselná 4, SK-918 43 Trnava, Slovakia; email: atrnka@truni.sk",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Yet, repeatability can be influenced by the interactive social strategies of individuals, for example, consistent inter-individual variation in aggression is well documented. Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level remains unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of consistent and repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species of shark, a taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet to be described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten independent shark groups across different habitats, testing repeatability in individual network position under changing environments. To understand better the mechanisms behind repeatable social behaviour, we also explored the coupling between individual preferences for specific group sizes and social network position. We quantify repeatability in sharks by demonstrating that despite changes in aggregation measured at the group level, the social network position of individuals is consistent across treatments. Group size preferences were found to influence the social network position of individuals in small groups but less so for larger groups suggesting network structure, and thus, repeatability was driven by social preference over aggregation tendency. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aggregation behaviour; Elasmobranch; Personality; Plasticity; Repeatability; Social traits","aggregation behavior; group size; life history trait; shark; social network; taxonomy; Animalia; Chondrichthyes","Jacoby, D.M.P.; Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology, Regent’s Park, United Kingdom",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Although recent work has provided insights into the demographic factors that influence inter-colony variation in collective behavior (i.e., colony-level personality or collective personality), relatively few studies have investigated how the physical environment (e.g., habitat structure) affects colony-level personality. Here, we study the emergence of collective personality in prey capture behavior in the social spider, Stegodyphus dumicola. We measured collective prey capture behavior four times over 36 days in a classic repeated measures design. We used four different artificial habitat (web support) structures in three different treatments: habitat structure was either (1) fixed and undisturbed, (2) disturbed with a complete removal of webbing between each measurement, or (3) disturbed with changes of habitat structure between each measurement. Our results revealed that repeatability in colony-level personality was retained as long as habitat structure was not altered. However, the repeatability of colony-level personality declined precipitously when groups were forced to build their webs on novel habitat structures. Furthermore, habitat structure affected collective capture behavior, that is, latency to attack and the number of attackers differed among colonies on different habitat structures. Collectively, our data demonstrate that habitat structure is instrumental in shaping both the mean and repeatability of the collective behavior of colonies and may influence overall foraging success. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Collective behavior; Habitat structure; Manipulation; Personality; Prey capture; Social spiders","colonization; emergence; environmental factor; foraging efficiency; habitat structure; interspecific variation; prey capture; social behavior; spider; Animalia; Araneae; Stegodyphus dumicola","Modlmeier, A.P.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, 213 Clapp Hall, 4249 Fifth Avenue, United States",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Animals in a low energetic state should accept higher risk than animals with larger energy reserves. In mammals, energy expenditure by females on gestation and lactation may exceed the relatively low cost of sperm production by males. It follows, if reproductive costs are indeed higher for females than for males, that reproductive females may be more likely than males to trade safety for food. Thus, we evaluated the use of safe versus risky foraging patches by male and female meadow voles using putatively safe and risky habitats. We also used behavioural trials to assess whether sexual differences in personality could account for any differences in patch use. Voles preferred to forage in safe patches over risky ones. There was no difference between male and female voles, or between reproductive and non-reproductive individuals, in their respective use of safe versus risky foraging patches. Personality also had no effect on patch choice. The results are consistent with recent studies on other species that have failed to find differences in reproductive costs between the sexes. Experiments on foraging behaviour might thus provide simple and repeatable tests for sexual differences and similarities in reproductive costs.","cost of reproduction; giving-up density; Microtus pennsylvanicus; optimal foraging theory; patch residence time; personality; predation risk","behavioral response; energy use; female; foraging behavior; male; patch dynamics; predation risk; reproductive cost; small mammal; sperm; trade-off; willingness to pay; Animalia; Mammalia; Microtus; Microtus pennsylvanicus; Muridae","Halliday, W.D.; Department of Biology, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Rd., Canada",,"Universite Laval",11956860,,,,"English","Ecoscience",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918810625

Identifying the genetic basis of behavioural variation in invasive species thus represents an important step towards understanding the evolutionary potential of the invader. Here, we sequenced a candidate region for neophilic/neophobic and activity behaviour - the complete exon 3 of the DRD4 gene - in 100 Yellow-crowned bishops (Euplectes afer) from two invasive populations in Spain and Portugal. The same birds were scored twice for activity behaviour while exposed to novel objects (battery or slice of apple) in captivity. Response to novel objects was repeatable (r = 0.41) within individuals. We identified two synonymous DRD4 SNPs that explained on average between 11% and 15% of the phenotypic variance in both populations, indicating a clear genetic component to the neophilic/neophobic/activity personality axis in this species. This consistently high estimated effect size was mainly due to the repeated measurement design, which excludes part of the within-individual nongenetic variance in the response to different novel objects. We suggest that the alternative alleles of these SNPs are likely introduced from the original population and maintained by weak or antagonistic selection during different stages of the invasion process. The identified genetic variants have not only the potential to serve as genetic markers of the neophobic/neophilic/activity personality axis, but may also help to understand the evolution of behaviour in these invasive bird populations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","dopamine receptor D4; Euplectes afer; genotype-phenotype association; multiple measurements; personality; Yellow-crowned bishop","Aves; Euplectes afer; Malus x domestica; dopamine 4 receptor; animal; animal behavior; article; DNA sequence; dopamine receptor D4; Euplectes afer; exon; exploratory behavior; female; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genotype; genotype-phenotype association; introduced species; male; molecular genetics; multiple measurements; nucleotide sequence; personality; Portugal; single nucleotide polymorphism; songbird; Spain; Yellow-crowned bishop; dopamine receptor D4; Euplectes afer; genotype-phenotype association; multiple measurements; personality; Yellow-crowned bishop; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Exons; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Genotype; Introduced Species; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Passeriformes; Personality; Polymorphism, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Portugal; Receptors, Dopamine D4; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Spain","Mueller, J.C.; Department of Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Seewiesen, Germany; email: mueller@orn.mpg.de",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09621083,,MOECE,"24750181","English","Mol.

In this study, we tested whether the production of one such nest defense behavior-hissing calls-may improve survival of incubating female great tits (Parus major). We found that 72.5 % of incubating females gave hissing calls when they were exposed to a stuffed woodpecker in their nest boxes. The repeatability of the number of hissing calls given was high, as was the latency to give the call. Additionally, natural nest predators attacked hissing and nonhissing females equally often. However, hissing females survived better than silent females. We tested responses of feral cats to playbacks of hissing call during their attacks of nest boxes and found that hissing calls prevented the predator attacks. Taken together, our findings indicate that hissing calls can deter predator attacks and potentially increase survival rates of nesting great tits or their offspring, or both. The propensity to give hissing calls may be related to personality type of incubating female great tits, which needs to be tested experimentally. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.","Antipredator behavior; Female mortality; Great tit; Hissing call; Keywords; Nest defense",,"Krams, I.; Institute of Systematic Biology, University of Daugavpils, 5401 Daugavpils, Latvia; email: indrikis.krams@ut.ee",,"Springer Verlag",08739749,,AECTD,,"English","Acta Ethol.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901022909

This phenomenon has been referred to as animal personality or behavioural syndromes. Little is known about consistency of animal personalities over entire life times. We investigated the repeatability of behaviour in common voles (Microtus arvalis) at different life stages, with different time intervals, and in different situations. Animals were tested using four behavioural tests in three experimental groups: 1. before and after maturation over three months, 2. twice as adults during one week, and 3. twice as adult animals over three months, which resembles a substantial part of their entire adult life span of several months. Results: Different behaviours were correlated within and between tests and a cluster analysis showed three possible behavioural syndrome-axes, which we name boldness, exploration and activity. Activity and exploration behaviour in all tests was highly repeatable in adult animals tested over one week. In animals tested over maturation, exploration behaviour was consistent whereas activity was not. Voles that were tested as adults with a three-month interval showed the opposite pattern with stable activity but unstable exploration behaviour. Conclusions: The consistency in behaviour over time suggests that common voles do express stable personality over short time. Over longer periods however, behaviour is more flexible and depending on life stage (i.e. tested before/after maturation or as adults) of the tested individual. Level of boldness or activity does not differ between tested groups and maintenance of variation in behavioural traits can therefore not be explained by expected future assets as reported in other studies. © 2013 Herde and Eccard; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Animal personality; Behavioural type; Common vole; Consistency; Microtus arvalis; Plasticity; Repeatability","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; experimental study; rodent; temporal variation; testing method; Animalia; Microtus arvalis; Muridae; animal; animal behavior; article; Arvicolinae; cluster analysis; exploratory behavior; female; male; personality; physiology; reproducibility; time; Arvicolinae; physiology; Animals; Arvicolinae; Behavior, Animal; Cluster Analysis; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Male; Personality; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Animals; Arvicolinae; Behavior, Animal; Cluster Analysis; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Male; Personality; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors","Herde, A.; Department of Animal Ecology, University of Potsdam, Maulbeerallee 1, 14469 Potsdam, Germany; email: herde@uni-potsdam.de",,,14726785,,,"24314274","English","BMC Ecol.",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888985768

At the same time, research on honest signalling of aggression has revealed that while some of the putative aggression signals are reliable, they are only imperfectly so. This study asks whether a significant portion of the variance in the aggression-signal regression may be explained by individual differences in signalling strategies. Using the wellstudied aggressive signalling system of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), we carried out repeated assays to measure both aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling of territorial males. Through these assays, we found that aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling were both highly repeatable, and moreover that aggressive behaviours in 2009-2010 predicted whether the birds would attack a taxidermic mount over a year later. Most significantly, we found that residual variation in signalling behaviours, after controlling for aggressive behaviour, was individually consistent, suggesting there may be a second personality trait determining the level of aggressive signalling. We term this potential personality trait 'communicativeness' and discuss these results in the context of honest signalling theories and recent findings reporting prevalence of 'under-signalling'. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Based on differential allocation theory that predicts biased reproductive investment of females depending on the attractiveness of mates, a number of previous studies have shown that egg production is related in various ways to ornamental sexual traits of males, but evidence for behavioural sexual traits is less abundant. In this study we examine such maternal effects in relation to birdsong. Because the Bengalese finch is a monomorphic songbird, courtship song serves a key role in mate choice. To take into account individual female differences in egg production performance, we sequentially paired naïve, captive, female Bengalese finches to two different males, and investigated if their reproductive investment (clutch size, egg mass and hatchling sex ratio) was related to the song traits of their mates. We found that clutch size and egg mass were highly repeatable within individual females while sex ratio was not. Despite the inflexibility of egg mass within each female, egg mass increased when females were mated to males with longer songs. In addition, we found a non-significant weak tendency toward male-biased sex ratio in relation to longer song duration of mates. Our findings suggest that females mated to better mates adjusted their reproductive investment by producing heavier eggs and possibly offspring of the more costly sex. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Bengalese finch; cryptic female choice; differential allocation; sex ratio; songbird",,"Soma, M.; Laboratory for Animal Behaviour and Intelligence, Department of Biology, Hokkaido University, Nishi 8, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0810, Japan; email: masayo.soma@sci.hokudai.ac.jp",,,00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893048928

How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is important for determining the function and evolution of animal personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots' response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage. This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus, the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping with age-dependent requirements and constraints. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural syndrome; Boldness; Docility; Marmota flaviventris; Ontogeny; Personality; Yellow-bellied marmot","age; behavioral ecology; environmental response; life history trait; rodent; survival; Animalia; Marmota; Marmota flaviventris","Petelle, M.B.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, 621 Charles E.

Personality has been linked to life-history traits, energetic traits and fitness, with implications for the evolution of behaviour. Personality has been quantified for a range of taxa (e.g., fish, songbirds, small mammals) but, so far, there has been little work on personality in bats, despite their diversity and potential as a model taxon for comparative studies. We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values associated with activity would increase between newly volant, pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a 24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats.

With the exception of very recent interest in individual behavioral plasticity (consistent differences in responsiveness), this within-individual variation has been largely ignored despite its importance in the study of proximate and ultimate questions about behavior. Here, we repeatedly scored the undisturbed activity of 30 adult male mosquitofish across multiple observation bouts spanning 132 days (n = 37 observations per fish). We found that the behavior of some individuals was consistently more predictable in a given context than others. Repeatability for this ""intraindividual variation"" (IIV; r = 0.29) was evident after accounting for individual differences in activity trends across days, and activity responses due to fine-scale temperature variation (i.e., individual plasticity in response to both variables). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that predictability of behavior is a repeatable characteristic of individual animals. We suggest that IIV represents an important axis of consistent behavioral variation that has previously not been formally considered. Finally, individual differences in predictability may similarly exist for labile morphological and physiological traits but have seemingly not been studied. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.","Behavioral consistency; Hormones; IIV; Intraindividual variation; Labile traits; Metabolism; Plasticity; Repeatability; Temperament; Within-individual","adult; animal; behavioral response; fish; hormone; male; metabolism; phenotypic plasticity; animal; animal behavior; article; biological model; Cyprinodontiformes; forecasting; male; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cyprinodontiformes; Forecasting; Male; Models, Biological","Biro, P.

Although any behavior might be context specific, studies using this single assay type must assume it reflects boldness in other similar contexts, otherwise it cannot reflect personality (defined as consistency across time and/or contexts). We attempted to validate whether a single assay of this type is correlated with other similar assays of boldness under more familiar, and less stressful, situations. We compared single emergence test scores of two species of damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi; P. amboinensis) in a novel environment, with two different behavioral assays of the same fish in subsequent repeated trials in home tanks. Although behavior was highly repeatable in home tanks, we found no correlation between emergence test scores in the novel environment and measures of latency to emerge from shelter following disturbance, or activity levels, on the first, second, or third observations in home tanks; there was also no correlation when we used average home tank scores from mixed models that accounted for individual differences (i.e., plasticity) in the rate of habituation (latency) and acclimation (activity). Our results therefore lead us to question the validity of using this single emergence test assay as a predictor of general boldness and to question the use of any single assay of behavior in personality research. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"behavioral response; bioassay; correlation; emergence; fish; habituation; phenotypic plasticity; research; shelter; Amphibia; Aves; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Pomacentridae; Pomacentrus wardi","Beckmann, C.; Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, 75 Pigdons Road, Geelong, Vic. 3216, Australia; email: c.beckmann@deakin.edu.au",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884976182

Subjective evaluations of consequences have recently been demonstrated to predict future drinking behavior; however, what predicts those evaluations is yet unknown. Social Learning Theory (SLT) provides a guiding framework in this study. Primary aims are to investigate whether individual differences in past experience with alcohol consequences and normative perceptions of alcohol consequences predict subjective evaluations (i.e., the extent to which consequences are perceived as negative, aversive, or severe) and weekly drinking behavior. We also test whether evaluations mediate the influence of past consequences and norms on weekly drinking behavior. Following a baseline assessment, participants (N=96 regularly drinking college students, 52% female) completed ten weekly web-based surveys on previous week alcohol use, consequences, and subjective evaluations of those consequences. A series of hierarchical linear models were used to test hypotheses. Most mediational pathways were not supported - weekly level evaluations do not appear to fully explain the effect of norms or past experience on weekly level drinking behavior. However, results demonstrated that normative perceptions of and past experience with consequences were associated with both weekly drinking behavior and subjective evaluations, and evaluations remained significant predictors of alcohol use behavior after accounting for these important between-person influences. Findings support the importance placed by SLT on cognition in drinking behavior, and suggest that norms for consequences and subjective evaluations may be appropriate targets of intervention in college students. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcohol consequences; College students; Hierarchical linear model; Normative perceptions; Subjective evaluations","alcohol; adult; alcohol consumption; article; college student; controlled study; drinking behavior; evaluation; female; human; human experiment; male; perception; Alcohol consequences; College students; dependent variable; DV; Hierarchical linear model; hierarchical linear modeling; HLM; ICC; independent variable; intraclass correlation; IV; Normative perceptions; SLT; social learning theory; Subjective evaluations; Alcohol Drinking; Attitude to Health; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Perception; Serial Learning; Students; Time Factors; Young Adult","Merrill, J.E.; Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Department of Behavioral and Social Science, Brown University, BOX G-S121-4, Providence, RI 02912, United States; email: Jennifer_Merrill@brown.edu",,,03064603,,ADBED,"23899424","English","Addict.

However, despite theoretical predictions that life-history trade-offs may cause and maintain personality differences, our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of personality remains poor, especially in long-lived species where trade-offs and senescence have been shown to be stronger. Furthermore, although much theoretical and empirical work assumes selection shapes variation in personalities, studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of personality traits are rare. Here we study one standard axis of personality, the shy-bold continuum, in a long-lived marine species, the wandering albatross from Possession Island, Crozet, by measuring the behavioral response to a human approach. Using generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable. We also find strong differences in boldness between breeding colonies, which vary in size and density, suggesting birds are shyer in more dense colonies. These results demonstrate that in this seabird population, boldness is both heritable and repeatable and highlights the potential for ecological and evolutionary processes to shape personality traits in species with varying life-history strategies. © 2013 The Authors.

Behaviours are, however, often plastic and to explain how plasticity and personality may coexist an adaptive framework has been developed. Still, there is little information on how personality is impacted by situations and contexts on an individual level. We investigated this in the European mink (Mustela lutreola) by performing a set of five experiments in two situations consisting of non-breeding and breeding season, and by using different test contexts. Three personality trait domains were identified; boldness, exploration and sociability. The levels of boldness and exploration changed between seasons but remained repeatable, which implies behavioural reaction norms and supports that the concept of personality remained applicable despite plasticity. Whilst males became bolder and more explorative in the breeding season females became shyer, which reflects European mink breeding behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours performed in mirror stimulus tests fell into different domains depending on whether, the test was conducted in the own territory or not, suggesting plasticity in the response towards conspecifics. To conclude, our results highlight the importance of situation and context for the expression of personality, and the significance of measuring multiple personality trait domains with several methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Breeding season; Context; European mink (Mustela lutreola); Personality; Plasticity; Situation","breeding season; conspecific; mustelid; phenotypic plasticity; reaction norm; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; breeding; exploratory behavior; female; male; mink; nonhuman; personality; plasticity; season; social behavior; social environment; Breeding season; Context; European mink (Mustela lutreola); Personality; Plasticity; Situation; Age Factors; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Male; Mink; Personality; Reproduction; Seasons","Haage, M.; Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: marianne.haage@zoologi.su.se",,,03766357,,BPROD,"23988476","English","Behav.

Furthermore, animals often show unpredictability in how much they respond to these events over time leading to the suggestion that personality and intraindividual variability (IIV) might have important fitness consequences. We investigated this hypothesis by focusing on the tendency for individually identifiable male fallow deer, Dama dama, to escalate low-level (noncontact) agonistic interactions to fighting during the rut. Males differed in their tendency to escalate noncontact interactions to fighting; however, repeatability in escalation rates was unstable over the rut suggesting that escalation rate is a poor measure of personality. There was no difference in the level of IIV in escalation rate shown by males. A comparison of IIV recorded over two consecutive annual ruts showed that IIV was highly correlated between years; therefore, over an extended time period individuals were consistent in their willingness to engage in fighting. There was a nonlinear relationship between IIV and mating success; specifically, individuals that showed either low or high IIV in escalation rate had lower mating success than individuals that showed intermediate levels of IIV. Aggression and the willingness to commit to fighting are important fitness correlates; nevertheless, our understanding of how personality and IIV are related to aggression is poorly understood. This study shows that although escalation rate appears to be a poor measure of personality in the fallow deer, IIV is related to increased fitness in individuals that show intermediate levels of predictability in their willingness to fight over therut. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Dama dama; Escalation rate; Fallow deer; Fighting; Intraindividual variability; Mating success; Personality; Predictability","aggression; agonistic behavior; behavioral response; deer; fighting; fitness; mating success; Animalia; Cervidae; Dama dama","Jennings, D.J.; Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, United Kingdom; email: domhnall.jennings@ncl.ac.uk",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Mathematical tools are needed to facilitate efficient interpretation of long-duration sleep-wake EEG recordings.Methods: Starting with matching pursuit (MP) decomposition, we automatically detect and parametrize sleep spindles, slow wave activity, K-complexes and alpha, beta and theta waves present in EEG recordings, and automatically construct profiles of their time evolution, relevant to the assessment of residual brain function in patients with DOC.Results: Above proposed EEG profiles were computed for 32 patients diagnosed as minimally conscious state (MCS, 20 patients), vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS, 11 patients) and Locked-in Syndrome (LiS, 1 patient). Their interpretation revealed significant correlations between patients' behavioral diagnosis and: (a) occurrence of sleep EEG patterns including sleep spindles, slow wave activity and light/deep sleep cycles, (b) appearance and variability across time of alpha, beta, and theta rhythms. Discrimination between MCS and VS/UWS based upon prominent features of these profiles classified correctly 87% of cases.Conclusions: Proposed EEG profiles offer user-independent, repeatable, comprehensive and continuous representation of relevant EEG characteristics, intended as an aid in differentiation between VS/UWS and MCS states and diagnostic prognosis.

Behavioral consistency has been shown to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses, which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations. Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females: 2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was influenced by season in the other year.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interrater reliability and clinical utility of the instrument when used by mental health nurses in daily care of patients with mental illness. This cross-sectional study was conducted in inpatient and outpatient adult psychiatric care units and in one adolescent inpatient unit at a university hospital in the Netherlands. Interrater reliability was measured based on the independent scores of two different nurses for the same patients. The clinical utility of the instrument was evaluated by means of a clinical utility questionnaire. To gain a deeper understanding of rating difficulties at the adolescent unit, additional data were collected in two focus group interviews. The overall results revealed a substantial level of agreement between nurses (intraclass correlation coefficient and Pearson 0.79). Some rating challenges were identified, including difficulties with scoring the instrument and using tailor-made interventions related to the scores. These challenges can be resolved using refined training and implementation strategies. When the Kennedy Axis V is accompanied by a solid implementation strategy in adult mental health care, the instrument can be used for short-term risk assessment and thereby contribute in efforts to reduce violence, suicide, self-harm, severe self-neglect, and enhanced objectivity in clinical decision-making. © 2012 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.","Instrument; Kennedy Axis V; Mental health nursing; Psychometric properties; Risk assessment; Violence","adolescent; adult; article; cross-sectional study; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; equipment; female; human; impulsiveness; Kennedy Axis V; male; mental disease; middle aged; Netherlands; nursing; nursing assessment; personality test; psychiatric nursing; psychological aspect; psychometric properties; psychometry; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistics; treatment outcome; university hospital; validation study; violence; young adult; instrument; Kennedy Axis V; mental health nursing; psychometric properties; risk assessment; violence; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dangerous Behavior; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Nursing Assessment; Personality Assessment; Psychiatric Nursing; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome; Violence; Young Adult","Faay, M.D.M.; Division of Neurosciences, Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Centre Utrecht, HPA.00.241, PO Box 85500, 3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; email: M.D.M.Faay@umcutrecht.nl",,,14458330,,,"23211020","English","Int.

RR estimates the between-individual variance in elevation (expected behavior in the mean environment) and variance in plasticity (individual-specific adjustment of behavior to the environment) and the covariance between these properties. These (co)variances allow deriving both environment-specific repeatability estimates and the individual-level correlation in behavior between environmental conditions, both of which are of key interest for understanding consistency in behavior over space and time, a core issue in animal personality research. However, very few studies use the RR estimates to produce this information. In this paper, I outline how to extract this information (including example code in R) and apply the approach to 16 estimates based on nine published RR studies. Despite the fact that the behaviors have a decent repeatability under different environmental conditions, I find that in half the cases, the cross-environmental correlation is low (<0.4). This implies that individuals differ in their behavioral trait values but that the ranking of these individual values tends to change between environmental conditions. This level of inconsistency in animal personality traits appears not to have been fully appreciated, and future studies on plasticity using RR should explicitly include it. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioral traits; Cross-environmental correlation; Random regression analysis","behavioral response; covariance analysis; environmental conditions; information; plasticity; ranking; regression analysis; research; Animalia","Brommer, J.

However, the repeatability of aggressive nest defence has not yet been studied in hosts of brood parasites, although host aggression against adult parasites represents a crucial line of antiparasitic defences. Here, we investigated the between-season repeatability of the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) aggression towards a stuffed dummy of the brood parasitic common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). We found that under the relatively stable risk of brood parasitism across breeding seasons, female responses to the cuckoo were highly repeatable, whereas male responses were variable. We suggest that the potential explanation for the observed patterns of female and male behaviours may lie in female's prominent roles in offspring care and nest protection, and in her lower renesting potential in comparison with that of males. However, further studies on the relationship between host aggression and other types of behaviours (host personality) and their fitness consequences under the fluctuating parasitism pressures are required to clarify the adaptive significance of aggressive behaviour observed in hosts of brood parasites. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"aggression; behavioral response; breeding season; brood parasitism; female; host; male; parasite; parental care; reproductive behavior; Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Animalia; Cuculus canorus","Trnka, A.; Department of Biology, University of Trnava, Priemyselná 4, SK-91843 Trnava, Slovakia; email: atrnka@truni.sk",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883458189

To be able to understand how an individual’s behavioural, physiological and life history traits may coevolve, we need to jointly quantify these traits in order to study their covariance. Few studies have established links between personality and immunity properties of an individual. We here examined covariation of a measure of skeletal size (tarsus length), three behavioural traits (activity, handling aggression and breath rate) and two immunological traits (IgG level and haematocrit), in 592 wild caught blue tits. Many individuals (201) were tested more than once, allowing quantification of individual consistency of all traits and partition of the covariances between the traits, using a multivariate mixed model, into between individual and residual covariances.We find individual consistency of all behavioural traits, indicating that these capture aspects of blue tit adult personality and also the physiological measures are repeatable. Contrary to the POLS expectation, we find no overall significant individual level correlation structure between these traits and a factor analytical approach confirmed that between individual correlations across traits were not due to a common (POLS) factor or driven by size (tarsus length). Based on a published power study, we conclude that there is no common syndrome of individual level covariance between personality and physiological traits in wild blue tits or that the effect sizes, such a syndrome generates, are too low (r <0.3) to detect. Future field-based work should be designed to explore low effect sizes and strive to measure specific traits whose involvement is implicated to have large effect sizes as based on, e.g. laboratory findings. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Behavioural trait; Blue tit; Haematocrit; Immune system; Immunoglobulin; Pace-of-life syndrome; Variance partitioning","correlation; ecological modeling; immune system; immunity; life history trait; passerine; physiology; wild population; Aves","Brommer, J.E.; Department of Biology, University of TurkuFinland",,"Springer Verlag",03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

Hypotheses for the coexistence of behavioral differences fall into 3 categories: variation in selection, frequency-dependent selection, and behavioral plasticity. We tested predictions of those hypotheses regarding geographic covariation of behavior with ecology, using a recent (≈40 years) biological invasion of common waxbills (Estrilda astrild). Behavior in tests for exploration and social interaction covaried among individuals, suggesting a behavioral syndrome, although we could only demonstrate within-individual repeatability in the test for social interaction. These 2 behaviors changed geographically with the ecology of sites (degree of climate variation) in an apparently adaptive way, rather than with the direction of invasion. We found behavioral plasticity but showed that short-term plastic effects do not explain geographic divergence. Differential dispersal does not explain geographic divergence either, which is orthogonal to the direction of invasion. Results are best interpreted either as evolved divergences, although a candidate-gene approach could not identify genetic correlates of behavior, or as long-term behavioral plasticity (e.g., effects of rearing environment). In this recent invasion, geographic differences in ecology and behavior equate to repeated and fast changes over time. Thus, fluctuations in ecological conditions, which are common in nature, may have a widespread role maintaining behavioral and personality differences via selection and/or long-term behavioral plasticity. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

An extreme form of anthropogenic alteration is the existence and rapid increase of urban areas. A key question, then, is how species cope with urbanization. It has been suggested that rural and urban conspecifics show differences in behaviour and personality. However, (i) a generalization of this phenomenon has never been made; and (ii) it is still unclear whether differences in personality traits between rural and urban conspecifics are the result of phenotypic plasticity or of intrinsic differences. In a literature review, we show that behavioural differences between rural and urban conspecifics are common and taxonomically widespread among animals, suggesting a significant ecological impact of urbanization on animal behaviour. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms leading to behavioural differences in urban individuals, we hand-raised and kept European blackbirds (Turdus merula) from a rural and a nearby urban area under common-garden conditions. Using these birds, we investigated individual variation in two behavioural responses to the presence of novel objects: approach to an object in a familiar area (here defined as neophilia), and avoidance of an object in a familiar foraging context (defined as neophobia). Neophilic and neophobic behaviours were mildly correlated and repeatable even across a time period of one year, indicating stable individual behavioural strategies. Blackbirds from the urban population were more neophobic and seasonally less neophilic than blackbirds from the nearby rural area. These intrinsic differences in personality traits are likely the result of microevolutionary changes, although we cannot fully exclude early developmental influences. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Animal personalities; Anthropogenic environmental change; Behavioural syndromes; Colonization; Microevolution; Neophilia; Neophobia; Phenotypic plasticity; Urbanization","adaptation; behavioral response; bird; colonization; environmental change; phenotypic plasticity; urbanization; animal; animal behavior; animal personalities; anthropogenic environmental change; article; behavioural syndromes; colonization; evolution; microevolution; neophilia; neophobia; personality; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; physiology; songbird; urbanization; animal personalities; anthropogenic environmental change; behavioural syndromes; colonization; microevolution; neophilia; neophobia; phenotypic plasticity; urbanization; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biological Evolution; Passeriformes; Personality; Phenotype; Urbanization; Animalia; Aves; Turdus merula","Miranda, A.C.; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Am Obstberg 1, Radolfzell, 78315, Germany; email: catarina.miranda@gmail.com",,,13541013,,,"23681984","English","Global Change Biol.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881554850

Such consistencies can arise because of the common innate government of traits (i.e., temperament). However, different behaviors can be mediated by different selection regimes and/or measured with different errors. Furthermore, contextual overlap among traits may also vary. These possibilities can cause dissimilarities in the pair-wise relationship between particular traits. To determine the relationships among the most studied behaviors, we performed a modern meta-analysis, in which we assessed the strength of correlations in each possible combination of traits. Relying on data from 81 scientific papers, we found that the correlations among behaviors were generally weak and that they varied in magnitude across comparisons (e.g., novel environment exploration and activity: r = 0.345; novel object exploration and activity: r = 0.074). The partial correlations among traits revealed that certain relationships (e.g., novel environment exploration/activity and the novel object exploration/risk taking) were independent of the covariation with other traits, whereas certain relationships (e.g., aggression/novel environment exploration) consistently weakened after controlling for covariance. Some relationships were affected by contextual overlap: the effect sizes were systematically higher when the behaviors were assayed in the same experimental compartment (e.g., same test room or aquarium). Different correlations are unlikely to emerge due to differences in repeatabilities that are associated with the measurement of different traits, as we found that averaged repeatabilities vary around the same intermediate magnitude for each behavior. We suggest that the most commonly assessed behavioral traits do not necessarily form equally independent domains. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

In contrast to most other species, personality of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, has mainly been studied with non-behavioral methods. We examined boldness, exploration tendency, persistence and tool-orientation in 29 captive chimpanzees using repeated experiments conducted in an ecologically valid social setting. High temporal repeatability and contextual consistency in all these traits indicated they reflected personality. In addition, Principal Component Analysis revealed two independent syndromes, labeled exploration-persistence and boldness. We found no sex or rank differences in the trait scores, but the scores declined with age. Nonetheless, there was considerable inter-individual variation within age-classes, suggesting that behavior was not merely determined by age but also by dispositional effects. In conclusion, our study complements earlier rating studies and adds new traits to the chimpanzee personality, thereby supporting the existence of multiple personality traits among chimpanzees. We stress the importance of ecologically valid behavioral research to assess multiple personality traits and their association, as it allows inclusion of ape studies in the comparison of personality structures across species studied behaviorally, and furthers our attempts to unravel the causes and consequences of animal personality. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Boldness; Chimpanzee; Exploration; Group-experiment; Persistence; Tool-orientation","age-related difference; behavioral ecology; captive population; experimental study; persistence; primate; principal component analysis; tool use; animal; animal behavior; article; boldness; chimpanzee; exploratory behavior; female; group-experiment; male; Pan troglodytes; persistence; personality; physiology; principal component analysis; social behavior; tool use; tool-orientation; boldness; chimpanzee; exploration; group-experiment; persistence; tool-orientation; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Male; Pan troglodytes; Personality; Principal Component Analysis; Social Behavior; Tool Use Behavior; Animalia; Pan; Pan troglodytes","Massen, J.J.M.; Department of Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, Wien A-1090, Austria; email: jorg.massen@univie.ac.at",,,02752565,,AJPTD,"23649750","English","Am.

Recently, the DSM-5 Levels of Personality Functioning Scale has moved it into the focus of psychiatric diagnostics. Based on Kernberg's concept of personality organization the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) was developed for diagnosing personality functioning. The STIPO covers seven dimensions: (1) identity, (2) object relations, (3) primitive defenses, (4) coping/rigidity, (5) aggression, (6) moral values, and (7) reality testing and perceptual distortions. The English version of the STIPO has previously revealed satisfying psychometric properties.Methods: Validity and reliability of the German version of the 100-item instrument have been evaluated in 122 psychiatric patients. All patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and were assessed by means of the STIPO. Moreover, all patients completed eight questionnaires that served as criteria for external validity of the STIPO.Results: Interrater reliability varied between intraclass correlations of .89 and 1.0, Crohnbach's α for the seven dimensions was .69 to .93. All a priori selected questionnaire scales correlated significantly with the corresponding STIPO dimensions. Patients with personality disorder (PD) revealed significantly higher STIPO scores (i.e. worse personality functioning) than patients without PD; patients cluster B PD showed significantly higher STIPO scores than patients with cluster C PD.Conclusions: Interrater reliability, Crohnbach's α, concurrent validity, and differential validity of the STIPO are satisfying. The STIPO represents an appropriate instrument for the assessment of personality functioning in clinical and research settings. © 2013 Doering et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Diagnosis; Personality disorder; Personality functioning; Reliability; Validity","adult; article; concurrent validity; correlation analysis; differential validity; female; Germany; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; personality disorder; psychometry; structured interview; Structured Interview of Personality Organization; validity; adolescent; aged; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; middle aged; personality; personality disorder; personality test; psychologic test; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; validation study; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Germany; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Personality; Personality Assessment; Personality Disorders; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results","Doering, S.; Department of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Gürtel 18-20, A-1090 Wien, Austria; email: stephan.doering@meduniwien.ac.at",,,1471244X,,BPMSC,"23941404","English","BMC Psychiatry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883222234

Here we explore how the composition of individual behavioural types within colonies influences colony-level behaviour in the social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum. First, we tested whether S.sarasinorum show stable individual differences in behaviour (i.e. individual personalities) and whether aspects of individuals' behaviour are correlated across contexts, in the form of a behavioural syndrome. As documented in many other animals, S.sarasinorum showed stable individual differences in behaviour that were repeatable across time, and correlated across contexts (i.e. aggressiveness, boldness). Second, we tested for and confirmed the presence of consistent intercolony variation (i.e. colony-level personalities) in collective foraging behaviour. Third, we generated artificially reconstituted colonies of known group size and personality composition to test for associations between colonies' personality composition and their collective foraging behaviour. In experimental colonies, we found that the average phenotypes of colony constituents were associated with colony-level behaviour, where colonies composed of smaller and bolder spiders were more responsive during foraging. However, the single best predictor of colony-level behaviour was the behavioural type of the single most extreme individual, where the boldness score of boldest individuals explained 66-69% of the variation in colony-level behaviour. Together, our results suggest that variation in the personality composition of social groups may be an important driver of variation in colony-level personality. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Araneae; Cooperative foraging; Emergent behaviour; Social group; Spider; Stegodyphus sarasinorum; Temperament","colony structure; community composition; correlation; fitness; foraging behavior; group size; phenotype; social behavior; spider; Animalia; Araneae; Stegodyphus","Pruitt, J.N.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: pruittj@pitt.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

The 'aggressive spillover hypothesis' (ASH) posits that pre-copulatory cannibalism represents a spillover of female aggressiveness from the juvenile foraging context, when aggressiveness is advantageous, to the adult mating context, when aggressiveness may be non-adaptive or maladaptive. The ASH suggests that individuals exhibit limited plasticity in aggressive behaviours because they are genetically canalised for indiscriminate aggressiveness towards prey and conspecifics, including males. Hence, a tendency to employ pre-copulatory cannibalism is a part of the female aggression syndrome, an assertion generally accepted in the personality field. We here re-evaluate the previous findings in the light of personality criteria, which we propose for ASH validation: between-individual differences, repeatability and heritability in tendency for pre-copulatory attacks (and pre-copulatory cannibalism) and voracity towards prey, and their correlation. To re-evaluate ASH and to allow for additional or alternative explanations, we ask whether pre-copulatory cannibalism depends on female hunger, mating status, size and/or male quality. Finally, we ask whether cannibalistic females have a reduced reproductive success as predicted by the ASH. While repeatability and heritability in voracity towards prey and its correlation with the tendency to engage in pre-copulatory cannibalism were found in certain systems, we lack any evidence for repeatability and heritability in pre-copulatory cannibalistic attempts and for its maladaptiveness. Rather than only resorting to the ASH, foraging and mate choice hypotheses may also explain pre-copulatory cannibalism. We suggest clarifying the use of the terms sexual cannibalism (effect) and female aggressiveness or tendency to attack and devour males (cause), and argue that male strategies to avoid cannibalism should be considered. We propose testing the ASH as the explanation for pre-copulatory cannibalism in those cases where female tendency to devour males correlates with actual pre-copulatory cannibalism and when all the above criteria are fulfilled. Finally, we propose future directions for studying the ASH. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"adaptation; aggression; cannibalism; conspecific; copulation; courtship; heritability","Kralj-Fišer, S.; Institute of Biology, Scientific Research Centre, Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Novi trg 2, P.

The results revealed that all three personality traits were highly repeatable over time in both sexes. Evidence of a complex syndrome in the form of a correlation between boldness, sociability and activity was found; however, this relationship was only present in males. Males that were more active in a familiar environment emerged more quickly from shelter into a novel environment and were more social. In general, male P. reticulata were bold, active and antisocial compared to females, with these differences probably a reflection of opposing life-history strategies.

Minimal literature exists to describe agreement between automated and static scales, and no known studies describe repeatability when used for daily measurements of dairy cows. This study establishes the repeatability of an automated walk-over cattle-weighing system, and agreement with static electronic scales, when used in a commercial dairy herd to weigh lactating cows. Forty-six lactating dairy cows from a seasonal calving, pasture-based dairy herd in southwest Victoria, Australia, were weighed once using a set of static scales and repeatedly using an automated walk-over weighing system at the exit of a rotary dairy. Substantial agreement was observed between the automated and static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Weights measured by the automated walkover scales were within 5% of those measured by the static scales in 96% of weighings. Bland and Altman's 95% limits of agreement were -23.3 to 43.6 kg, a range of 66.9 kg. The 95% repeatability coefficient for automated weighings was 46.3 kg. Removal of a single outlier from the data set increased Lin's concordance coefficient, narrowed Bland and Altman's 95% limits of agreement to a range of 32.5 kg, and reduced the 95% repeatability coefficient to 18.7 kg. Cow misbehavior during walk-over weighing accounted for many of the larger weight discrepancies. The automated walk-over weighing system showed substantial agreement with the static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. This contrasted with limited agreement when assessed using Bland and Altman's method, largely due to poor repeatability. This suggests the automated weighing system is inadequate for detecting small liveweight differences in individual cows based on comparisons of single weights. Misbehaviors and other factors can result in the recording of spurious values on walk-over scales.

In ectotherms, functional integration of locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of the potential for coadaptation among these traits. For this reason, we analyzed interindividual variation, covariation, and repeatability of the thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed, preferred body temperature, thermal precision, and resting metabolic rate measured in ca. 200 common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) that varied by sex, age, and body size. We found significant interindividual variation in selected body temperatures and in the thermal performance curve of maximal sprint speed for both the intercept (expected trait value at the average temperature) and the slope (measure of thermal sensitivity). Interindividual differences in maximal sprint speed across temperatures, preferred body temperature, and thermal precision were significantly repeatable. A positive relationship existed between preferred body temperature and thermal precision, implying that individuals selecting higher temperatures were more precise. The resting metabolic rate was highly variable but was not related to thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed or thermal behavior. Thus, locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism were not directly functionally linked in the common lizard. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

We experimentally tested whether consistently repeatable anti-predatory responses and resting metabolic rates (RMR) correlated with survival rates of individuals exposed to a nocturnal predator, the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) (Rodentia: Muridae). Resting metabolic rate was part of a syndrome involving anti-predator behaviour. Individuals with lower RMR concealed themselves against predators in substrate more successfully than individuals with higher RMR, and hiding was associated with longer periods of immobility.

If so, then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here, we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were also detected. A single vector explains 80 % of the among-individual variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness. We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through impacts on resource acquisition. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aggression; Competition; Dominance; Personality; Resource-dependence; Xiphophorus","aggression; agonistic behavior; dominance; fish; fitness; growth rate; life history trait; phenotype; reproductive success; Animalia; Archosargus probatocephalus; Xiphophorus; Xiphophorus birchmanni","Wilson, A.

However, individual differences in behaviors relating to this conflict have not been fully explored. Three experiments with two test repeats 1-3 days apart were conducted using 8-16 Japanese Black cows at intervals of approximately 3 weeks between Experiments 1 and 2 and 1 year between Experiments 2 and 3. Individual cows were tested in a grassed arena (85m×30m in Experiments 1 and 2, 130m×18m in Experiment 3) with an adjoining group pen holding the peers. Plastic washtubs (16 in Experiments 1 and 2, 25 in Experiment 3) containing 150g grain-based concentrate were placed at 5m increments on the centerline of the arena to entice test cows away from the group. Behavior of test cows were recorded for 30min as: maximum (Dmax) and mean (Dmean) distance from the group, number of total (Ntotal) and different (Ndiff) tub visits, and proportion of time eating concentrate (Peatconc) and grazing sward (Pgraze). Cows showed consistency in Dmax, Dmean, Ntotal and Ndiff over the short periods of 1-3 days (repeatability within experiments=0.41-0.80) and approximately 3 weeks (Pearson r between Experiments 1 and 2=0.81-0.91, P&lt;0.05). Cows were further consistent in Dmax, Ntotal and Ndiff over the extended period of 1 year (Pearson r between Experiments 2 and 3 and between Experiments 1 and 3=0.68-0.93, P&lt;0.05). By contrast, Peatconc and Pgraze showed poorer consistency within cows, giving low repeatability estimates (0.29-0.34) in Experiment 2 and low Pearson r between Experiments 2 and 3 (0.30-0.31, P&gt;0.05). It was concluded that Dmax, Ntotal and Ndiff provide a reliable measure of the propensity for individual cows to trade sociability for feeding when the test is repeated over both short and extended periods. A test arena longer than 130m would be necessary for fully discriminating individual behavioral traits of cattle. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Feeding; Intra-individual consistency; Sociability; Trade-off","cattle; feeding behavior; grassland; grazing; trade-off; Animalia; Bos","Hirata, M.; Department of Animal and Grassland Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-2192, Japan; email: m.hirata@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

The coping style model provides a set of predictions about correlations between behavioural and neurophysiological reactions to a stressful situation. According to this model, high levels of activity should be correlated with high levels of aggressiveness at the behavioural level, and to high sympathetic reactivity, low parasympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate levels) and low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis reactivity (low production of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor). More recent versions of the model, however, are challenging this view and consider the possibility of independent axes of coping style and stress reactivity. The coping style model has mainly been tested on artificially selected or inbred lines in laboratory settings. Such a situation restricts its generalization to a larger number of species and there is a need for studies testing it in the wild under more natural situations. Here, we test the predictions of the coping style model in a wild alpine marmot, Marmota marmota, population. We show that several behavioural (i.e. exploration in an open field, impulsivity and docility) and neurophysiological traits (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate and cortisol production) assumed to represent individual differences in coping style were significantly repeatable over 2-3 years. Not all the correlations between traits predicted by the coping style model were found in marmots, which supports the more recent two-axes model. Furthermore, most correlations were observed at the between-individual level, and the within-individual correlations (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) were weaker. Overall, our results support the prediction of the coping style model, but highlight the fact that the association between traits found in artificial conditions may be weaker in a more natural setting. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Breathing rate; Cortisol; Docility; Heart rate; MCMCglmm; Open-field test; Personality; Variance components","aggression; behavioral ecology; developmental biology; mammal; neurology; physiological response; population structure; prediction; variance analysis; wild population; Mammalia; Marmota; Marmota marmota; Marmota marmota marmota","Réale, D.; Canada Research Chair in Behavioural Ecology, Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal, 8888 Montréal, QC H3C 3P8, Canada; email: reale.denis@uqam.ca",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

To date our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning consistent individual differences in behaviour (also termed behavioural types (BTs)) remains limited. Theoretical work suggests life-history tradeoffs drive BT variation, however, empirical support is scarce. Moreover, whilst life-history is known to be phenotypically plastic in response to environmental conditions during ontogeny, the extent to which such plasticity drives plasticity in behavioural traits and personality remains poorly understood. Using a natural clonal vertebrate, Kryptolebias marmoratus, we control for genetic variation and investigate developmental plasticity in life-history and three commonly studied behavioural traits (exploration, boldness, aggression) in response to three ecologically relevant environments; conspecific presence, low food and perceived risk. Simulated predation risk was the only treatment that generated repeatable behaviour i.e. personality during ontogeny. Treatments differed in their effects on mean life-history and behavioural scores. Specifically, low food fish exhibited reduced growth rate and exploration but did not differ from control fish in their boldness or aggression scores. Conspecific presence resulted in a strong negative effect on mean aggression, boldness and exploration during ontogeny but had minimal effect on life-history traits. Simulated predation risk resulted in increased reproductive output but had minimal effect upon average behavioural scores. Together these results suggest that life-history plasticity/variation may be insufficient in driving variation in personality during development. Finally, using offspring derived from each rearing environment we investigate maternal effects and find strong maternal influence upon offspring size, but not behaviour. These results highlight and support the current understanding that risk perception is important in shaping personality, and that social experience during ontogeny is a major influence upon behavioural expression. © 2012 The Authors.",,"aggression; developmental biology; environmental effect; environmental risk; fish; genetic variation; growth rate; life history; ontogeny; plasticity; predation risk; risk perception; simulation; theoretical study; Cyprinodontiformes; Cyprinodontoidei; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Vertebrata","Edenbrow, M.; Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, College of Life and Environmental Sciences Psychology, Univ. of Exeter, Washington Singer Laboratories, Perry Road, Exeter, EX4 4QG, United Kingdom; email: mathewedenbrow@hotmail.com",,,00301299,,OIKSA,,"English","Oikos",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876423035

However, the effectiveness of selection acting on any one signal type may depend on selective forces acting on the same characteristics in other signal types, particularly if the signals share a common physical production mechanism. In anurans, signal variability has been related to the potential for various forms of selection by female choice on the characteristics of male advertisement calls. The significance of variability in the characteristics of another vocalization type, the aggressive call, is less well understood. In the present stiudy, within- and between-male variability was measured in several characteristics of both advertisement and aggressive calls in the treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus. Many characteristics of both call types were repeatable within males. Fine-temporal and spectral characteristics generally had low variation within males, whereas gross-temporal characteristics were more variable. Unexpectedly, there were strong correlations between both measures of variability and mean values of the call characteristics of advertisement and aggressive calls. Thus, despite potentially conflicting selection pressures acting on advertisement and aggressive calls, the characteristics of individuals' calls were consistent across these two signal types. The potential forces responsible for consistency across call types are discussed, including morphological constraints and behavioural syndromes that act across different signalling contexts.

Few instruments exist which assess behavior problems in infants. The current longitudinal study examined the performance of three behavior-rating scales for individuals with IDD that have been proven psychometrically sound in older populations: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI-01), and the Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R). Data were analyzed for 180 between six and 36 months old children at risk for IDD. Internal consistency (Cronbach's α) across the subscales of the three instruments was variable. Test-retest reliability of the three BPI-01 subscales ranged from .68 to .77 for frequency ratings and from .65 to .80 for severity ratings (intraclass correlation coefficients). Using a multitrait-multimethod matrix approach high levels of convergent and discriminant validity across the three instruments was found. As anticipated, there was considerable overlap in the information produced by the three instruments; however, each behavior-rating instrument also contributed unique information. Our findings support using all three scales in conjunction if possible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Aberrant Behavior Checklist; At risk; Behavior Problems Inventory; Children; Infants; Multitrait-multimethod; Neurodevelopmental disorders; Psychometric properties; Reliability, Validity; Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised; Toddlers","Aberrant Behavior Checklist; article; Behavior Problem Inventory; child; child behavior; controlled study; correlation coefficient; developmental disorder; discriminant validity; human; infant; instrument validation; intellectual impairment; internal consistency; multitrait multimethod; preschool child; psychometry; rating scale; Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised; risk assessment; risk factor; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; test retest reliability; validation process; Aggression; Checklist; Child Behavior; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Behavior; Intellectual Disability; Male; Personality Inventory; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Severity of Illness Index; Stereotyped Behavior","Rojahn, J.; Department of Psychology, George Mason University, 10340 Democracy Lane, Suite 202, Fairfax, VA 22033, United States; email: jrojahn@gmu.edu",,,08914222,,RDDIE,"23511345","English","Res.

Methods: In total, 655 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were assessed with the TMV-PSP, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Global Assessment of Functioning-Severity (CGI-S), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Construct validity was assessed by factorial analysis. The internal consistency and temporal stability of the PSP were obtained by calculating intra-class correlation coefficients. Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the TMV-PSP were 0.73. The patients' PSP showed a negative correlation with the PANSS (r = - 0.65) and its subscales, including positive (r = - 0.35), negative (r = - 0.67), general factors (r = - 0.62) and the CGI-S scores (r = - 0.47). The PSP showed a positive correlation with MMSE scores (r = 0.59), ADL (r = 0.45) and IADL scores (r = 0.6). All p-values for the correlation coefficients were less than 0.001. Good test-retest reliability was obtained (intraclass coefficient = 0.91, 95 CI: 0.82-0.96, p = 0.0001). Factor analysis explained a total of 83.6% of the variance, with Component 1 contributing 58.4% and Component 2 contributing 24.8%. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the TMV-PSP using a structured interview and a computerized scoring calculator is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of social functioning in patients with schizophrenia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Computerized scoring calculator; Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP); Schizophrenia; Semi-structured interview; Taiwan; Validation","adult; article; clinical assessment; computer analysis; construct validity; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; Cronbach alpha coefficient; daily life activity; factorial analysis; female; Global Assessment of Functioning Severity; hospital patient; human; Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; mathematical computing; mini mental state examination; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; predictive value; priority journal; reliability; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; scoring system; social interaction; structured interview; Taiwan; Taiwanese Mandarin version of the Personal and Social Performance scale; test retest reliability; therapeutic community; validation process; validity; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personality; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Severity of Illness Index; Social Behavior; Taiwan; Young Adult","Lee, S.-M.; Corresponding author at: 1.

We here applied a reaction-norm perspective implemented as a random regression phenotypic model (RRPM) to behaviors measured on blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. During 3 consecutive breeding and winter seasons (2007-2009), a total of 508 wild-caught blue tits were assayed in a standard, artificial setup (a bird cage) for 1) activity, 2) time to escape, and 3) neophobia-related behavior. Activity was found to be repeatable both within and across seasonal contexts, but escape time and neophobia-related behavior were repeatable only in winter. Our RRPM confirmed that this latter finding was due to crossing of the individual-specific reaction norms between the 2 seasonal contexts. Our work illustrates how a behavior measured in a standardized manner may or may not be repeatable across time within a context but not between contexts, depending on the interindividual variation in reaction-norm properties. Our findings suggest that research on animal behavior plasticity can benefit from taking onboard context-specific analyses in a more explicit manner than what is typically done. © 2012 The Author.","animal personality; bird behavior; blue tit; plasticity; random regression analysis","behavioral ecology; bioassay; bird; ecological modeling; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; seasonal variation; standardization; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Cyanistes caeruleus","Kluen, E.; Bird Ecology Unit, Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Viikinkaari 1, 00014 Helsinki, Finland; email: edward.kluen@gmail.com",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

However, various personality models exist. Contrasting their strengths and weaknesses leads to the conclusion that there is presently no model that is truly superior to others in depicting animal personality. Furthermore, the present review highlights aspects in which animal, and in particular equine personality potentially relate to animal welfare. Three approaches are examined which may be taken to improve welfare: (1) genetically selecting for personality traits that make the horses better adapted to their designated work and/or husbandry conditions, (2) assessing personality in individual horses to optimize matching with owners and type of work and (3) influencing the ontogeny of personality traits, e.g. by specific training and husbandry regimes. Each of these strategies has its merit, but as a prerequisite, valid personality assessment methods are required. Although publication bias is likely present, most testing procedures yield acceptable inter-observer reliabilities and repeatabilities across time, even if repeatability across situations tends to be comparably low. Heritability estimates ranging mostly between h2=0.15 and h2=0.40 for traits assessed in personality tests are likewise promising. Research has paid less attention to intra-observer reliability, construct validity or discriminant ability, but based on pleiotropy it is argued that the latter is not essential for a trait to be valid. Therefore, some valid methods are available for use in assessment and subsequent selection of horses or personality-influencing strategies, ultimate resulting in reduction of stress in horses' everyday life. © CAB International 2013.","Character; Genetics of behaviour; Horse; Human-animal interaction; Personality; Temperament; Welfare",,"Borstel, U.K.V.; Department of Animal Science, Georg-August Universität Göttingen, Albrecht-Thaer-Weg 3, 37075, Göttingen, Germany; email: koenigvb@gwdg.de",,,17498848,,,,"English","CAB Rev.

The aim of this paper was to analyse shot types to determine the extent to which they are played in different court areas and a more detailed analysis to determine whether the time available had an influence on the shot selected. Ten elite matches, contested by fifteen of the world's top right handed squash players (age 27 ± 3.2, height 1.81 ± 0.06 m, weight 76.3 ± 3.7 kg), at the men's World Team Championships were processed using the SAGIT/Squash tracking system with shot information manually added to the system. Results suggested that shot responses were dependent upon court location and the time between shots. When these factors were considered repeatable performance existed to the extent that one of two shots was typically played when there was limited time to play the shot (< 1.20s). For example, it was clear that when players did not have a lot of time to hit the ball (low time i.e. < 1.06s, and mid time i.e. 1.06 - 1.20s) in the front left corner close to the side wall, the crosscourt lob was used frequently (44.30% and 36.31% respectively) whereas when there was more time this shot was seldom used (13.64%). Consequently variant and invariant behaviour were shown to exist in elite squash although for the first time it was suggested that the availability of time to play a shot contributed to which of these behaviours was evident. This analysis could be extended by adopting a case study approach to see how individual differences in strategy and tactics affect shot selections. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.","Invariant behaviour; SAGIT; Strategy; Tactics",,"Vučković, G.; University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: goran.vuckovic@fsp.uni-lj.si",,,13032968,,,,"English","J.

In most studies, the parental version of the CFSS-DS is used; however, no information is available concerning the extent to which parents are able to report dental fear on behalf of their children. Aim. This study aims to assess whether parents are accurate reporters of their child's dental fear. Methods. The CFSS-DS was filled out by 326 children in a classroom setting and by 167 parents (mostly mothers) at home on behalf of their child. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used as a measure of agreement between both CFSS-DS versions, and reasons for nonagreement were assessed. Results. Mean CFSS-DS for children was 21.15 (SD=6.4) and for parents 23.26 (SD=6.7). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.57. After selection of the 73.1% most accurate reporting parents, the ICC was 0.90. In general, parents estimate the dental fear of their children higher than their children do (P≤0.001), whereas parents of high anxious children (HAC) estimate this fear lower, and parents of low anxious children (LAC) estimate this fear higher. Anxious parents (AP) estimate the dental fear of their children significantly higher than nonanxious parents (NAP) (P≤0.001), but the children of AP do not estimate their own dental fear higher than children of NAP. Conclusions. In general, parents tend to estimate the dental fear of their children slightly higher than their children. © 2012 The Authors.

When individuals interact with others, these interactions may form a social network and be described using social network measures. We suggest that these social interactions may reflect behavioral predispositions that themselves may be less variable within than between individuals. If so, the social attributes quantified using network statistics may themselves be personality traits. We have previously found that some social attributes of yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) may be heritable, suggesting that they are profitably viewed as reflecting individually distinctive social predispositions. Here, we asked the degree to which defensive aggression was independent of various measures of social aggression. We quantified defensive aggression when animals were live trapped and asked whether it was related to how socially tolerant marmots were. We found that although some of these social traits were epeatable, none were strongly correlated across contexts. Our results suggest that defensive aggression and social aggression are independent and thus not likely to constrain each other. © The Author 2012.","Aggression; Defensive behavior; Personality traits; Social network; Yellow-bellied marmots","aggression; defense behavior; rodent; social network; Animalia; Marmota; Marmota flaviventris","Blumstein, D.T.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, 621 Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1606, United States; email: marmots@ucla.edu",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Until recently, the ecological and social circumstances influencing the developing phenotype have not been investigated in much detail. Nevertheless, they represent an important step in niche construction by which the developing organism can in principle adjust to predictable aspects of its life history. By dynamically changing photoperiod during gestation, we tested how behavioral phenotypes (BPs) and physiology of juvenile cavies (Cavia aperea) adjust to seasonal differences in prenatal photoperiod. The prenatal photoperiod, simulating spring or autumn, led to faster or slower maturation in females but the relative size rank in litter also exerted a major influence on the onset of maturation. In addition, prenatal photoperiod strongly influenced BP and stress response in juvenile animals. Heavy females born into autumn developed a less explorative, more shy BP, whereas heavy females born into spring produced more explorative, bolder BP. Smaller sisters did not differ in the onset of maturation and, correspondingly, we found no differences in the BP. We did not find differences in the BP in males also. Early personality traits, though repeatable, changed over ontogeny to such an extent that early group differences in BP had completely disappeared in adults. Our results indicate high developmental plasticity with respect to predicted optimal life history and suggest long-term plasticity in response to photoperiod. © The Author 2012.","Developmental plasticity; Differential consistency; Life-history strategies; Pace of life; Seasonality; Structural consistency","behavioral ecology; body size; environmental conditions; juvenile; life history trait; maturation; niche partitioning; ontogeny; photoperiod; physiological response; pregnancy; rodent; seasonality; Animalia; Cavia aperea; Caviidae","Guenther, A.; Department of Behavioural Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; email: anja.guenther@uni-bielefeld.de",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

However, the psychometric properties of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire in common musculoskeletal disorders like acute low back pain have not been adequately studied. Patients' perceptions vary across different populations and affect coping styles. Thus, our aim was to determine the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity of the Dutch language version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire in acute non-specific low back pain patients in primary care physical therapy. Methods. A non-experimental cross-sectional study with two measurements was performed. Eighty-four acute low back pain patients, in multidisciplinary health care center in Dutch primary care with a sample mean (SD) age of 42 (12) years, participated in the study. Internal consistency (Cronbach's) and test-retest procedures (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients and limits of agreement) were evaluated at a one-week interval. The concurrent validity of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire was examined by using the Mental Health Component of the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Results: The Cronbach's for internal consistency was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.67 - 0.83); and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient test-retest reliability was acceptable: 0.72 (95% CI, 0.53 - 0.82), however, the limits of agreement were large. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient measuring concurrent validity 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46 - 0.80). Conclusion: The Dutch version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire is an appropriate instrument for measuring patients' perceptions in acute low back pain patients, showing acceptable internal consistency and reliability. Concurrent validity is adequate, however, the instrument may be unsuitable for detecting changes in low back pain perception over time. © 2013 Hallegraeff et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Acute nonspecific low back pain; Brief IPQ; Illness perceptions; Reliability; Validity","adult; article; body height; body weight; concurrent validity; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; female; human; low back pain; major clinical study; male; nociception; pain assessment; physiotherapy; primary medical care; questionnaire; Short Form 36; test retest reliability; Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire; Cronbach alpha coefficient; internal consistency; low back pain; mental health; pain assessment; symptom; validity; adaptive behavior; attitude to health; low back pain; middle aged; multicenter study; Netherlands; pain; perception; predictive value; primary health care; psychological aspect; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; time; treatment outcome; validation study; Acute Pain; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Pain Measurement; Perception; Physical Therapy Modalities; Predictive Value of Tests; Primary Health Care; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","Hallegraeff, J.M.; Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen, Netherlands; email: jmhallegraeff@online.nl",,,14712474,,,"23369321","English","BMC Musculoskelet.

In addition, how juvenile and adult male fish differ in levels of behavioral consistency, both before and after EE2 exposure, is unknown. To examine these questions, juvenile and adult male Siamese fighting fish were presented with a dummy male and dummy female simultaneously both before and after acute exposure to a nominal (15 ng/L) dose of EE2. Multiple trials were conducted to measure how consistent individual differences are affected by age and EE2 exposure. Both female- and male-directed behaviors decreased after short-term exposure to EE2. Juvenile and adult fish differed in the number of female-directed tail beats and bites they performed, with adult fish performing more tail beats and juvenile fish performing more bites. EE2 exposure had a greater effect on consistent individual differences in female-directed than in male-directed behaviors, which may be a byproduct of intense artificial selection for aggression in this species. Repeatability values were lower both before and after exposure in juvenile than in adult fish, suggesting that individuals become more consistent with age. This study suggests that male Siamese fighting fish vary in their sensitivity to short-term EE2 exposure and stresses the importance of examining behavior over multiple time points both within and across age classes to gain a more thorough understanding of the effects of endocrine disruptors on behavior. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"17alpha ethinyloestradiol; ethinylestradiol; unclassified drug; adult; age class; behavioral response; courtship; dose-response relationship; endocrine disruptor; fighting; individual variation; juvenile; male; perciform; pollution effect; pollution exposure; age; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; article; endocrine disease; female; fish; male; nonhuman; priority journal; Siamese fighting fish; tail; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Courtship; Endocrine Disruptors; Male; Perciformes; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Macropodinae","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, Biddeford, ME, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,00904341,,AECTC,"23073845","English","Arch.

Spatial properties of individual localization behavior can be represented in the form of perceptual maps. Individual differences in these maps may reflect properties of internal body representations, and perceptual maps may therefore be a useful method for studying these representations. For this to be the case, individual perceptual maps need to be reproducible, which has not yet been demonstrated. We assessed the reproducibility of localizations measured twice on subsequent days. Ten subjects participated in the experiments. Non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli were applied at seven sites on the lower arm. Subjects localized the stimuli on a photograph of their own arm, which was presented on a tablet screen overlaying the real arm. Reproducibility was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the mean localizations of each electrode site and the slope and offset of regression models of the localizations, which represent scaling and displacement of perceptual maps relative to the stimulated sites. The ICCs of the mean localizations ranged from 0.68 to 0.93; the ICCs of the regression parameters were 0.88 for the intercept and 0.92 for the slope. These results indicate a high degree of reproducibility. We conclude that localization patterns of non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli on the arm are reproducible on subsequent days. Reproducibility is a necessary property of perceptual maps for these to reflect properties of a subject's internal body representations. Perceptual maps are therefore a promising method for studying body representations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Body representations; Electrocutaneous stimulation; Localization of cutaneous stimuli; Reproducibility of cutaneous spatial perception; Tactile spatial perception","adult; arm; article; behavior; clinical article; correlation coefficient; depth perception; electrode; female; human; human experiment; male; measurement; photography; priority journal; reproducibility; self concept; sensation; somatosensory system; stimulation; Adult; Brain Mapping; Electric Stimulation; Female; Humans; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Somatosensory Cortex; Space Perception","Steenbergen, P.; Mira Institute for Biomedical Technology, Technical Medicine, Biomedical Signals and Systems, University of Twente, Drienerlolaan 5, Postbox 217, 7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; email: p.steenbergen@utwente.nl",,,00144819,,EXBRA,"23212469","English","Exp.

Despite its intuitive appeal, little is known with regards to how individual differences amongst translocated animals influence their post-release survival, growth, and reproduction. We measured consistent pre-release responses to novelty in a familiar environment (boldness; repeatability=0.55) and cortisol response in a group of captive-reared Tasmanian devils, currently listed as ""Endangered"" by the IUCN. The devils were then released at either a hard- or soft-release site within their mothers' population of origin, and individual growth, movement, reproduction (females only), and survival across 2-8 months post-release was measured. Sex, release method, cohort, behavior, and cortisol response did not affect post-release growth, nor did these factors influence the home range size of orphan devils. Final linear distances moved from the release site were impacted heavily by the release cohort, but translocated devils' movement overall was not different from that in the same-age wild devils. All orphan females of reproductive age were subsequently captured with offspring. Overall survival rates in translocated devils were moderate (~42%), and were not affected by devil sex, release method, cohort, release weight, or pre-release cortisol response. Devils that survived during the study period were, however, 3.5 times more bold than those that did not (effect size r=0.76). Our results suggest that conservation managers may need to provide developmental conditions in captivity that promote a wide range of behaviors across individuals slated for wild release.

However, most studies report on short-term behavioural correlations without insight into individual consistency or temporal stability of the behavioural syndrome. Here, we examine the individual repeatability of single behaviours, and the presence and temporal stability of a context-general behavioural syndrome in a solitary piscivorous predator, the pike (Esox lucius). Behavioural measurements on the same individuals were quantified independently through time and across three contexts: activity in the presence of a competitor, exploration of a novel environment and boldness under predation risk. There was no indication of a temporally stable behavioural syndrome, consisting of boldness, activity and exploration, nor were individuals consistent in the separate behaviours, contradicting the general assertion of its taxonomic prevalence. Furthermore, the study did not provide support for size or growth-dependent behaviour in this size-dimorphic species in conditions of limited food availability. The study highlights the importance of independent multiple observations of individual behaviour across time or contexts when measuring behavioural repeatability and covariation. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"behavioral ecology; dimorphism; food availability; piscivory; predation risk; predator; taxonomy; teleost; temporal analysis; Esocidae; Esox lucius","Nyqvist, M.J.; Centre for Conservation Ecology and Environmental Sciences, School of Applied Sciences, Bournemouth University, Talbot Campus, Poole, Dorset BH12 5BB, United Kingdom; email: mnyqvist@bournemouth.ac.uk",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872401935

A fundamental factor underlying such differences is believed to be the degree to which individual behavior is guided by environmental stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in the wild using free-ranging great tits. Personality variation was quantified using exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, which has previously been shown to be repeatable and correlated with other behaviours in this and other populations of the same species. By temporarily removing food at feeding stations we examined whether birds with different personality differed in returning to visit empty feeders as this may provide information on how birds continue to sample their environment after a sudden change in conditions. In two summer experiments, we found that fast-exploring juveniles visited empty feeders less often compared to slow-exploring juveniles. In winter, sampling behaviour was sex dependent but not related to personality. In both seasons, we found that birds who sampled empty feeders more often were more likely to rediscover food after we again re-baited the feeding stations, but there was no effect of personality. Our results show that personality types may indeed differ in ways of collecting environmental information, which is consistent with the view of personalities as different styles of coping with environmental changes. The adaptive value of these alternative behavioural tactics, however, needs to be further explored. © 2013 van Overveld, Matthysen.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; article; bird; controlled study; coping behavior; environmental change; feeding behavior; female; great tit; juvenile animal; male; nonhuman; personality; sex difference; species difference; summer; wild animal; winter; Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Behavior, Animal; Belgium; Environment; Female; Information Seeking Behavior; Likelihood Functions; Male; Models, Statistical; Observation; Passeriformes; Personality; Seasons; Sex Factors","van Overveld, T.; Evolutionary Ecology Group, Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; email: thijs.vanoverveld@ua.ac.be",,,19326203,,,"23383299","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873250970

This study aimed to validate the use of a remote low power (165mW) carbon dioxide laser device for the assessment of thermal nociceptive thresholds in cats. Repeatabilites were established based on individual responses to three thermal tests on the same day and across 4 consecutive days. A total of 12 thermal tests were conducted on each of eight male and eight female de-sexed adult cats. As a control a non-thermal helium aiming laser was used to ensure the animals were responding to the thermal component of the device. All thermal tests elicited a behavioural response with the large majority being a skin twitch known as the panniculus reflex (97%). None of the non-thermal tests resulted in this reflex behaviour. There was no evidence that cats became sensitised or habituated to the low power thermal stimulus on any given day (P=0.426) or across days (P=0.115), or that there was any interaction between the two time factors (P=0.084). There was also no difference in latency to respond between males and females (P=0.094), although there was a significant interaction between the day of testing and the sex of the subject (P=0.042). Significant intra-class correlations demonstrated that individual responses were repeatable over days 1-3 (all P&lt;0.05) but not over day 4 (P=0.096). A significant intra-class correlation was also evident across all days when data were combined (P&lt;0.0001). This technique shows some promise in assessing individual nociceptive thresholds and as a tool to establish associated individual differences.

While these differences occur in a variety of contexts in a wide range of organisms, how recent experience affects behavioral consistency remains underexplored. Male Siamese fighting fish exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior when both a male and a female are present. However, whether these responses can be shaped by immediate recent aggressive experience is unknown. In this study, males first were presented with paired dummy male and female conspecifics after they had been isolated to obtain a baseline, no-experience measure. Males then won and lost fights and were retested with the dummies after each fight. These three experience types (no, win, loss) occurred both when males did and did not have nests to determine the effects of nest presence, experience, and the interaction between these factors on behavioral consistency. Overall behavior did not change based on experience with the exception of male-directed tail beats. Repeatability values were affected more by having a nest than fight outcome. This study demonstrates that consistent individual differences in behavior to conflicting stimuli are fairly resistant to short-term aggressive experiential effects. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.","Behavioral flexibility; Consistent individual differences; Experiential effects; Repeatability; Siamese fighting fish","Macropodinae","Dzieweczynski, T.

In support of model predictions, individuals consistently differed in behavioural plasticity when the presence of conspecifics influenced the potential payoffs of a foraging opportunity.

We performed a pilot study in both breeding and wintering populations of the Great Tit (Parus major), and we char-acterised three typical behavioural traits during a standard ringing procedure in captured birds. We assessed between-individual variations in breath rate, pecking rate and the number of distress calls displayed in response to handling, and also calculated the within-individual variation of these traits by repeated behavioural measurements. We found that these behaviours were consistently displayed within individuals (with repeatability varying between 0.44 and 0.82), and there was also some modest correlation between them (e.g. breath rate covaried with the number of distress calls). Furthermore, using multivariate linear models assessing a role of some potential predictors we found that a considerable amount of between-individual variation can be explained by sex and age differences and also by variation in body condition. However, the magnitude and direction of these relationships was inconsistent across seasons. Our results are in line with previous findings that several consistent behavioural traits measured during human handling could reflect individual specific antipredator strategy, but some confounding effects cannot be ruled out. Hence, our preliminary results require careful interpretation, and further studies are needed to assess the exact magnitude by which different behavioural traits are inter-related. © 2013, BirdLife Hungary.

This study was designed to examine the factor structure of the modified Timeline Followback (TLFB). Method: Undergraduate students (n = 573; 68.9% female) who drank alcohol at least once in the past 30 days completed an online version of the modified TLFB, a measure of alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis supported the previously proposed four-factor structure of the consequences assessed by the modified TLFB (i.e., personal, social, role functioning, and physical consequences). Internal consistency of the four categories, as assessed by deleted-item odds ratios, was good. Additionally, correlations between subscale scores and measures of alcohol use provided evidence of convergent validity, and intraclass correlations between two administration formats (online vs. in-person) indicated preliminary concurrent validity of the four factors. Conclusions: Overall, this study found support for the factor structure that was previously proposed by Norberg et al. Both the results of the confirmatory factor analysis and the deleted-item odds ratios indicate that most items fit the model well.

Being able to produce a wide range of variants of one kind of behavior, e. g., a very short and a very long response time to a stimulus under different environmental conditions, can be described as behavioral plasticity. How such behavioral reaction norms develop for individuals is poorly understood, but several factors are likely to play a role. We investigated what factors may affect how the risk-taking behavior of the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, is shaped during ontogeny. We manipulated larval density to represent the potential intensity of future competition for females in a lek of males, determined adult moths' reaction to predator signals, and tested for plasticity in the silence response, i. e., the acoustic evasion behavior of the moths during the experiments. While we found no effect of larval density on either the probability or the duration of the silence response, 11 % of the variance in duration could be explained by differences between families, and 30 % of the variance was the result of differences between individuals. We found evidence for habituation to the predator signal, clearly indicating that the silence response is a plastic-enough trait to be adjustable to the immediate environment. These results suggest that the degree to which individuals take risks in the context of acoustic signaling depends more on the immediate context and, possibly, genetic differentiation than it is a product of adaptive developmental plasticity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Achroia grisella; Developmental plasticity; Phenotypic plasticity; Predation; Repeatability; Sexual signaling","genetic differentiation; moth; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; signaling; Achroia grisella; Lepidoptera","Cordes, N.; Evolutionary Biology, Bielefeld University, Morgenbreede 45, 33615 Bielefeld, Germany; email: ncordes@uni-bielefeld.de",,,03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

However, other components of social behaviour such as those describing the intensity, frequency, directedness and individual repeatability of interactions in animal groups have largely been neglected. Network analysis offers a valuable opportunity to characterize individual consistency of traits in labile social groups and therein provide novel insights to personality research in ways previously not possible using traditional techniques. Should individual network positions be consistently different between individuals under changing conditions, they might reflect expressions of an individual's personality. Here, we discuss a conceptual framework for using network analyses to infer the presence of individual differences and present a statistical test based on randomization techniques for testing the consistency of network positions in individuals. The statistical tools presented are useful because if particular individuals consistently occupy key positions in social networks, then this is also likely to have consequences for their fitness as well as for that of others in the population. These consequences may be particularly significant since individual network position has been shown to be important for the transmission of diseases, socially learnt information and genetic material between individuals and populations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioural types; Social network analysis; Temperament","animal; conceptual framework; disease transmission; fitness; social network; Animalia","Wilson, A.

We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviourwas unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution. © 2013 The Authors.","Aggression; Behavioural syndrome; Exploration; Parental care; Path model; Structural equation modelling","behavioral ecology; bird; fitness; nestling; phenotype; population structure; reproductive success; statistical analysis; Cyanistes caeruleus; aggression; animal; animal behavior; exploratory behavior; female; Germany; male; physiology; reproduction; sexual behavior; songbird; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Germany; Male; Passeriformes; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Mutzel, A.; Department of Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, 82319 Seewiesen, Germany; email: mutzel@orn.mpg.de",,"Royal Society",09628452,,PRLBA,"23782885","English","Proc.

For example, consistent behavioral traits can affect trappability/catchability, independent of obvious factors such as size and gender, and these traits are often correlated with other repeatable physiological and/or life history traits. If so, systematic sampling bias may exist for any of these traits. The extent to which this is a problem, of course, depends on the magnitude of bias, which is presently unknown because the underlying trait distributions in populations are usually unknown, or unknowable. Indeed, our present knowledge about sampling bias comes from samples (not complete population censuses), which can possess bias to begin with. I had the unique opportunity to create naturalized populations of fish by seeding each of four small fishless lakes with equal densities of slow-, intermediate-, and fast-growing fish. Using sampling methods that are not size-selective, I observed that fast-growing fish were up to two-times more likely to be sampled than slower-growing fish. This indicates substantial and systematic bias with respect to an important life history trait (growth rate). If correlations between behavioral, physiological and life-history traits are as widespread as the literature suggests, then many animal samples may be systematically biased with respect to these traits (e. g., when collecting animals for laboratory use), and affect our inferences about population structure and abundance. I conclude with a discussion on ways to minimize sampling bias for particular physiological/behavioral/life-history types within animal populations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Behavior; Fishing; Harvest; Life history; Personality; Selection; Temperament","behavioral ecology; fish; gender; growth rate; life history trait; physiology; population distribution; population structure; sampling; selection; taxonomy; wild population; animal; article; environmental monitoring; fish; growth, development and aging; methodology; reproducibility; sample size; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Sample Size; Animalia","Biro, P.

The study of individual variation requires tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into between- and within-individual components. This is essential as variance components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We provide an overview of how mixed-effect models can be used to partition variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into between- and within-individual variance components. Optimal sampling schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and within-individual correlations, are detailed. Mixed-effect models enable the usage of unambiguous terminology for patterns of biological variation that currently lack a formal statistical definition (e.g. 'animal personality' or 'behavioural syndromes'), and facilitate cross-fertilisation between disciplines such as behavioural ecology, ecological physiology and quantitative genetics. © 2012 The Authors.

We previously used objective measures to demonstrate that bariatric surgery candidates engage in high levels of SB overall, but supplementing these measures with subjective reports would provide information about time allocated to different forms of SB. The aim of this study was to examine self-reported time spent performing specific types of SB and discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured estimates of total sedentary time in bariatric surgery candidates. Methods: A total of 52 bariatric surgery candidates (87% female; age = 46.2±9.1 years; body mass index [BMI] = 45.3±6.7) completed the 9-item Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) as a subjective measure of SB and wore the SenseWear Armband (SWA; SenseWear, Pittsburgh, PA) as an objective measure. Paired samples t tests and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) assessed measurement discrepancy. Results: Television-viewing was the most frequently performed type of SB (2.7±1.6 hours per day), followed by paper/computer work (1.9±1.8 hours per day), driving/riding in automobile (1.2±1.1 hours per day), and sitting/talking on telephone (1.1±1.2 hours per day). On average, the SBQ and SWA produced similar estimates of daily sedentary time (hours per day) at the group level (9.6±4.8 versus 9.3±1.9; mean difference = -.34±4.6; P =.59), although agreement between the measures at the individual level was poor (mean absolute value of difference = 3.8±2.8 hours per day; ICC =.22; P =.06). Conclusion: Television-viewing was the single SB in which participants most frequently engaged and thus may be an important modifiable target for reducing total sedentary time in bariatric surgery candidates. The SBQ and SWA can be used similarly to describe SB levels in this patient population at the group level; however, ability of these measures to produce comparable estimates of sedentary time for any individual patient is limited. © 2013 American Society for Metabolic Bariatric Surgery.","Bariatric; Measurement; Obesity; Physical activity; Sedentary; Television","adult; aged; art; article; bariatric surgery; body mass; car driving; conversation; correlation coefficient; female; human; major clinical study; male; music; priority journal; questionnaire; reading; sedentary behavior questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; self report; sitting; Student t test; television viewing; work; Adult; Aged; Automobile Driving; Bariatric Surgery; Employment; Exercise; Female; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Preoperative Care; Questionnaires; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle; Self Report; Television; Young Adult","Bond, D.S.; Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Miriam Hospital, 196 Richmond Street, Providence, RI 02903, United States; email: dbond@lifespan.org",,,15507289,,,"23265767","English","Surg.

Squeeze chute exit velocity was obtained for 1,181 crossbred yearling steers using ES and FS temperament systems. Flight speed used infrared sensors to determine the time taken for an animal to traverse a fixed distance of 1.83 m after exiting the squeeze chute. Exit score (1 = walk, 2 = trot, 3 = canter, and 4 = run) was assigned by 2 different observers when each steer crossed a fixed point between the infrared sensors. All animals were scored with each system (ES and FS) simultaneously on exiting the squeeze chute on d -21 and d -1 of the experiment. Of the 1,181 cattle, 357 were moved to a nearby research feedyard for use in a 140 d feedlot trial. These cattle were scored using both measurement systems and BW was recorded at 35 d intervals throughout the trial. Exit score was assessed for observer reliability, ES and FS were compared for measurement repeatability, and both were assessed on ability to predict ADG. Exit score between observers on a single day showed considerable agreement (weighted Kappa = 0.66), indicating the system was reliable between different observers. However, the agreement for a single observer between day was only moderate (weighted Kappa = 0.40), indicating a day effect for ES. In addition, although mean velocities for day were not different (P &gt; 0.18; FS = 2.98 ±.87 and 3.02 ± 0.87 m/s for day, respectively), the persistence of FS for each animal was low (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.25). The frequency that an animal would be placed into the same third of FS or receive the same ES on consecutive weigh days was 50% and 60.0%, respectively, and both were moderate predictors of ADG (R2 = 0.14 and R2 = 0.17). These data indicate that ES and FS are reliable instruments for assessment of temperament on a given day, and show moderate repeatability across days. Exit score and FS show similar ability to predict ADG and can be used interchangeably as measures of temperament. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science.

One particularly important topic in this context is how individuals' variation in behaviour shapes group-level characteristics. We investigated how fish that express different locomotory behaviour in an asocial context move collectively when in groups. First, we established that individual fish have characteristic, repeatable locomotion behaviours (i.e. median speeds, variance in speeds and median turning speeds) when tested on their own. When tested in groups of two, four or eight fish, we found individuals partly maintained their asocial median speed and median turning speed preferences, while their variance in speed preference was lost. The strength of this individuality decreased as group size increased, with individuals conforming to the speed of the group, while also decreasing the variability in their own speed. Further, individuals adopted movement characteristics that were dependent on what group size they were in. This study therefore shows the influence of social context on individual behaviour. If the results found here can be generalized across species and contexts, then although individuality is not entirely lost in groups, social conformity and group-size-dependent effects drive how individuals will adjust their behaviour in groups. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Harvest selection may also act on behavioral traits, although this field of research has so far received less attention. We used acoustic tags and a network of receivers to monitor the behavior and fate of individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, N = 60) in their natural habitat on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Fish with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow- and deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration.Natural selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual characteristics tended to persist and thereforemay be termed personality traits.We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries management should consider fish behavior. This would be of particular relevance for spatial management actions such as marine reserve design. © 2012 The Authors.

However, despite numerous theoretical explanations there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour. However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test. Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity, physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment matching. © 2012 Twiss et al.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; article; auditory stimulation; breeding; consistent individual differences; correlation analysis; environmental factor; female; growth rate; Halichoerus grypus; intraspecific variation; lactation; male; nonhuman; organism colony; phenotype; plasticity; seal; sexual behavior; species differentiation; United Kingdom; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecosystem; Environment; Female; Reproduction; Seals, Earless; Cnidaria; Halichoerus grypus; Mammalia","Twiss, S.

The amount of risk animals take for a given resource depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between individuals of different personality types. We tested whether individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment, we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites. During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk. Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using optimality approaches. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Boldness; Ecological validation; Grey mouse lemur; Microcebus murinus; Novel object test; Personality; Repeatability; Risk taking; Risk-sensitive foraging","behavioral ecology; body condition; energy budget; foraging behavior; model validation; predation risk; primate; Animalia; Lemur; Lemuridae; Microcebus murinus","Dammhahn, M.; Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology Unit, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Kellnerweg 4, 37077 Göttingen, Germany; email: mdammha@gwdg.de",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We present a novel approach: a repeated-measures design to examine individual variation in locomotor performance of male Xiphophorus hellerii as the sexually selected sword develops ontogenetically and to determine whether the growth of a sexually selected trait alters consistency of performance. Individual differences in sprint speed, critical swimming speed (stamina), and relative sword length were statistically repeatable over 9 wk. However, using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes, the best-fit predictive models for swimming performance did not include sword length or relative sword length. Furthermore, in less supported models and within-week comparisons, there was no statistically significant effect of sword length on performance. These results suggest little effect of the sword on locomotor abilities, which is inconsistent with results from some previous experimental manipulations, possibly because compensatory traits develop ontogenetically in parallel with the sword. However, our results are consistent with correlational studies of natural variation that suggest no locomotor cost of the sword. These results do not necessarily imply a complete lack of a cost to the sword but rather lack of a functional cost for swimming performance. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Recently (Herczeg and Garamszegi Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66:161-169, 2012), we introduced the concept of syndrome deviation that allows the study of behavioural syndromes at the individual level by focusing on the individual deviation from the hypothetical perfect group-level behavioural correlation. Subsequently, Dingemanse et al. (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 66:1543-1548, 2012) emphasized that behavioural syndromes refer to the between-individual component of phenotypic correlations, and only this component is relevant for syndrome deviation. They also recommended mixed models to decompose the between- and within-individual correlations. We agree that separating these components is important, but the proposed approach is impractical to apply for functionally different behaviours because (1) the assumption of constant within-individual correlations is unjustified and (2) different behaviours cannot be measured at the same time. Further, our simulations based on mixed models show that the statistical differentiation between the within- and between-individual components is inefficient when using realistic sample sizes. Until the separation of between- and within-individual correlations is resolved, we recommend alternative approaches for empirical behavioural syndrome research that consider the repeatability of the behaviours and the optimal balance between within- and between-individual sample sizes. Syndrome deviation calculated from phenotypic correlations of traits that are proven to be individual specific, or from the between-individual correlations if possible, is a meaningful metric to describe behavioural consistency and to explain its evolutionary significance. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioural consistency; Behavioural syndrome; Behavioural type; Personality; Syndrome deviation; Temperament",,"Herczeg, G.; Behavioural Ecology Group, Department of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, Eötvös Loránd University, Pázmány Péter sétany 1/c, 1117 Budapest, Hungary; email: gaborherczeg@caesar.elte.hu",,,03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types, including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials. Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant association between the tendency to guard and morphological and physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the product of prevailing environmental and social conditions. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Alternative reproductive behaviour; Animal personality; Behavioural syndrome; Boldness; Mating system; Sperm competition; Territorial males","Animalia; Rhodeus; Rhodeus amarus","Reichard, M.; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Květná 8, 603 65 Brno, Czech Republic; email: reichard@ivb.cz",,,00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866705386

One of the main drivers of the genesis and maintenance of biodiversity is mobility, i.e. the net result of the interaction between physiological performances (movement capacity) and behavioural decisions (movement decisions). Although several previous studies have found personality traits related to mobility, it is not yet clear whether mobility involves a real syndrome, i.e. whether individuals showing good movement capacity are also more likely to decide to move, and whether these inter-individual differences are consistent across time. 2. The aim of the present study was therefore to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of inter-individual variation in mobility by measuring three traits related to mobility under experimental conditions in a butterfly species, and to test the existence of correlations between these traits. These measures implied movement capacity and movement decision. 3. It was shown that mobility-related traits were (i) consistent across time, (ii) inter-correlated, and (iii) dependent upon sex and morphology. 4. These results therefore suggest the existence of a mobility syndrome in a butterfly. Such findings highlight the necessity to accurately integrate inter-individual variation (behavioural syndrome) in our comprehension of the evolution of movement strategies. © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.","Dispersal; Exploration; Mobility; Personality; Pieris brassicae; Repeatability; Shyness/boldness; Syndrome","butterfly; dispersal; individual variation; interspecific variation; mobility; morphology; movement; Pieris brassicae","Ducatez, S.; Department of Biology, McGill University, 1205 avenue Docteur Penfield, Montréal, QC, H3A 1B1, Canada; email: simon.ducatez@mail.mcgill.ca",,,03076946,,EENTD,,"English","Ecol.

In the present study, we examined the short- and long-term repeatability and stability of two unrelated personality traits - exploratory tendencies and struggling rate - using captive female zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that, overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were repeatable in the long term. We found interindividual differences in short-term stability of exploratory tendencies, but not struggling rate, providing evidence for differences in intraindividual variability. In the long term, struggling rate significantly decreased between the two experimental sessions, whereas exploratory tendencies remained stable. Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both sessions did not differ. Our results suggest that short- and long-term repeatability and stability of personality may vary between individuals, depending on the behavioural trait under scrutiny. As a consequence, deducing personality from measures realized earlier in a subject's life should be performed with caution.

The decisions where to settle and how far to travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g. specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set. Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration and natal dispersal. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal personality; Barn owl; Breeding dispersal; Local adaptation; Natal dispersal; Tyto alba","breeding site; color; data set; decision making; local adaptation; melanin; natal dispersal; physiological response; polymorphism; raptor; reproductive success; Animalia; Strigiformes; Tyto alba; Tytonidae","van den Brink, V.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; email: Valentijn.vandenbrink@unil.ch",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females, would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females. Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness, helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival. However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood in isolation from effects of individual quality. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Age; Body condition; Boldness; Corticosterone; Flight initiation distance; Incubation duration; Personality; Predation risk; Repeatability; Somateria mollissima","age; body condition; female; fitness; flight behavior; hormone; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; reproductive behavior; seabird; Aves; Somateria mollissima","Seltmann, M.W.; ARONIA Coastal Zone Research Team, Åbo Akademi University and Novia University of Applied Sciences, Raseborgsvägen 9, FI-10600 Ekenäs, Finland; email: martin.seltmann@novia.fi",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

One important mechanism by which animals cope with changes in their environment is through physiological responses to stressors mediated by glucocorticoid hormones. Here we perform biological and physiological validations of a minimally-invasive technique for assessing fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) in captive and wild groups of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). Then we draw from ten years of data on these obligate hibernators at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado, USA to assess the extent to which seasonal and daily changes explain naturalistic variation in baseline levels of FCMs. Interestingly, beyond important population-level variation with respect to year, season, time of day, sex, age and reproductive state, we found repeatable inter-individual differences in FCMs, suggesting this hormonal trait might be a meaningful target of selection. FCM levels were 68% lower in captive than wild marmots, suggesting that the natural environment in which these animals occur is generally more challenging or less predictable than life in captivity. Most live-trapping events failed to represent stressors for wild marmots such that repeated measurements of traits were possible with minimal "" stress"" to subjects. We also document the natural ranges of annual and seasonal variation necessary for understanding the extent to which anthropogenic assaults represent stressors for wild mammals. Taken together, this study provides a foundation for understanding the evolution of hormonal traits and has important welfare and conservation implications for field biologists. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Animal welfare; Conservation; Hibernation; Hormonal traits; Reproduction; Stress","corticosterone; glucocorticoid; age; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal welfare; article; biological trait; coping behavior; environmental stress; feces analysis; female; hormone determination; intraspecific variation; male; Marmota; natural selection; nonhuman; priority journal; seasonal variation; species conservation; validation study","Smith, J.E.; Biology Department, Mills College, Oakland, CA 94613, United States; email: jesmith@mills.edu",,"Academic Press Inc.",00166480,,GCENA,"22732084","English","Gen.

These differences can be expressed in two ways: context-specifically or context-generally. The former is characterized by consistent responses in one context (i. e. repeatability), whereas the latter by consistency that spans contexts (i. e. behavioral syndromes). The proximate causes of behavioral consistency remain unclear, yet there is evidence that physiology may couple the expression of some behavioral traits in unrelated contexts. We therefore explored the correlation between bold behavior of female sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and the condition of the hepatopancreas, an organ vital to crustacean metabolism and reproduction. We did this by taking replicate measurements of two risk-taking behaviors per individual in the contexts of predator avoidance and environment exploration, and examining correlations within and between these observations. We then determined the relationship of behavior with hepatopancreas mass and lipid content. Individual crabs responded consistently within each context. However, across-context correlations were absent, indicating that boldness is isolated, at least in the selected scenarios. Additionally, anti-predator and exploratory behaviors were significantly influenced by size but not linked to hepatopancreas physiology. Our results show that context-specific trait expression may occur in the absence of a physiological correlate. © 2012 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.","Exploration; Hepatopancreas; Hepatosomatic index; Hiding time; Lipid","Animalia; Celuca pugilator; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Ocypodidae; Uca","Decker, R.

Box 65, 00014 Helsinki, Finland","In evolutionary and behavioural ecology, increasing attention is being paid to the fact that functionally distinct behaviours are often not independent from each other. Such phenomenon is labelled as behavioural syndrome and is usually demonstrated by phenotypic correlations between behaviours like activity, exploration, aggression and risk-taking across individuals in a population. However, published studies disagree on the strength, and even on the existence of such relationships. To make general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed the literature using modern meta-analytic approaches. Based on a large dataset, we investigated the overall relationship between behaviours that are expected to form a syndrome and tested which factors can mediate heterogeneities in study outcomes. The average strength of the phenotypic correlation between behaviours was weak; we found no effect of the phylogeny of species but did observe significant publication bias. However, even accounting for this bias, the mean effect size was positive and statistically different from zero (r = 0. 198). Effect sizes showed considerable heterogeneity within species, implying a role for population-specific adaptation to environmental factors and/or between-study differences in research design. There was a significant positive association between absolute effect size and repeatability of behaviours, suggesting that within-individual variation of behavioural traits can set up an upper limit for the strength of the detected phenotypic correlations. Moreover, spatial overlap between the contexts in which different behaviours were assayed increased the magnitude of the association. The small effect size for the focal relationship implies that a huge sample size would be required to demonstrate a correlation between behaviours with sufficient statistical power, which is fulfilled only in very few studies. This suggests that behavioural syndromes often remain undetected and unpublished. Collectively, our meta-analysis revealed a number of points that might be worth to consider in the future study of behavioural syndromes. © 2012 The Author(s).","Behavioural type; Consistency; Natural selection; Personality; Phylogenetic meta-analysis; Temperament","adaptation; aggression; behavioral ecology; correlation; data set; environmental factor; heterogeneity; meta-analysis; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetics; phylogeny; population structure; risk factor","Garamszegi, L.

These phenomena may violate statistical assumptions about the non-random variance component in sampling effort. A major reason why this assumption is often not fulfilled is because the probability of being sampled (i. e., being captured or observed) may depend on species-specific characteristics. Here, we test this assumption by using information on within-species sample sizes and missing data from five independent comparative datasets of European birds. First, we show that the two estimates of data availability (missing values and within-species sample size) are positively correlated and are associated with research effort in general (the number of papers published). Second, we demonstrate biologically meaningful relationships between data availability and phenotypic traits. For example, population size, risk-taking, and habitat specialization independently predicted within-species sample size. The key determinants of missing data were population size and distribution range. However, data availability was not structured by phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate that the accuracy of sampling is repeatable and distributed non-randomly among species, as several species-specific attributes determined the probability of observation. Therefore, data availability seems to be a species-specific trait that can be shaped by ecology, life history, and behavior. Such relationships raise issues about non-random sampling, which requires attention in comparative studies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Generalized least squares; Independent contrasts; Personality; Research philosophy; Statistics; Trappability; Weighted regression","accuracy assessment; bird; data set; hypothesis testing; interspecific interaction; life history; phenotype; phylogenetics; population distribution; population size; regression analysis; research work; sampling; Aves","Garamszegi, L.

In addition, most behavioral studies do not examine the effects at multiple time points. This study examined the effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on behavior when male Siamese fighting fish encounter female and male dummy conspecifics simultaneously. Thus, how chemical exposure impacts behavioral consistency and whether individuals differ in their sensitivity to exposure was assessed. Overall aggression was reduced after fluoxetine administration while courtship was unaffected. Fluoxetine affected behavioral consistency towards both the male and female, with individuals behaving less consistently to the male and more consistently to the female. In addition, males appeared to differ in their sensitivity to fluoxetine exposure as not all males reduced their aggression after administration. This has important implications for studying the effects of unintended pharmaceutical exposure. Exposure may have evolutionary implications as it may influence both territorial defense and mating success. In sum, these findings demonstrate that pharmaceutical exposure may alter more than just overall level of behavior and stress the importance of examining the effects of exposure on an individual level. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Aggression; Behavioral flexibility; Consistent individual differences; Fluoxetine; Repeatability; Siamese fighting fish; SSRIs","fluoxetine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; controlled study; courtship; drug effect; environmental exposure; female; fish; male; nonhuman; priority journal; social behavior; Aggression; Animals; Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; Courtship; Female; Fishes; Fluoxetine; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Sexual Behavior, Animal","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, Biddeford, ME 04005, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,00319384,,PHBHA,"22722098","English","Physiol.

Method: 129 parents were included in the study, each with a child or adolescent (7 to 18 years old) in outpatient psychotherapy. In 80 cases both parent and self-report was available. Participants filled out the DIKJ as well as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/Youth Self Report (YSR) at the beginning of therapy. Results: The parent version of the DIKJ proved to be reliable as well as convergently and divergently valid: moderate to high correlations with the internalising sacles of the CBCL and low correlations with the externalising scale of the CBCL. The findings were similar for both parent and self-ratings. Intraclass correlations between parent and child ratings were moderate. DIKJ scores above the cut-off corresponded with the diagnostic status from the K-SADS diagnostic interview in 59% of the self-reports and 57% of the parent reports. Conclusions: The DIKJ parent version shows promising reliability and validity in a clinical setting. The DIKJ may be used as a biper-spective instrument to screen for depressive symptoms.

Interspecific comparisons have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part, to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity. We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and identified four 'clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future studies. © 2012 Carter, Feeney.",,"animal behavior; animal personality; article; Chrysiptera rollandi; coral reef; damselfish; Dischistodus perspicillatus; evolution; fish; Neopomacentrus azysron; observational study; personality; Pomacentridae; Pomacentrus amboinensis; Pomacentrus chrysurus; Pomacentrus coelestis; Pomacentrus moluccensis; Pomacentrus nagasakiensis; Pomacentrus wardi; population dispersion; quantitative analysis; species comparison; species difference; startle reflex; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Personality; Species Specificity; Animalia; Anthozoa; Pisces","Feeney, W.

Consequently, a degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an organism's ability to cope with novel (e.g. urban) environments. Yet behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated between- and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness, whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would be a possible scenario. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Behavioural polymorphism; Behavioural syndrome; Frequency-dependent selection; Heritability; Personality","aggression; foraging behavior; heritability; Holarctic Region; individual variation; life history trait; mortality; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; polymorphism; spider; urban area; Animalia; Araneae; Larinioides sclopetarius","Kralj-Fišer, S.; Institute of Biology, Scientific Research Centre, Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Novi trg 2, SI 1001 Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: simonakf@gmail.com",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

At a population level, different behavioural types (e.g. bold and shy) often exist, and the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness. We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e. shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However, an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural plasticity; Behavioural type; Field cricket; Gryllus integer; Predation pressure","aggression; antipredator defense; behavioral response; cricket; predation risk; predator; Animalia; Gryllinae; Gryllus integer","Niemelä, P.T.; Department of Biology, University of Oulu, P.O.

A number of temperament and related behaviour tests have been developed in order to make assessment of equine personality more objective. However, rarely these tests have been validated for their use as a selection tool. Thus, as a first step the aim of the present study was to integrate a temperament tests into horse performance tests, in order to assess variability and repeatability of horses' reactivity under the rider and the reliability of the judges' assessment thereof. The temperament test was comprised of three novel stimuli, including a visual stimulus (BALL), a visual and tactile stimulus (GATE), and a visual and auditory stimulus (CANS). A total of 224 mares and stallions were subjected to the test during their participation in station performance tests for riding horses, and 133 of these horses were subjected to the test a second time either 2-3 weeks or 18 weeks after the first test. Horses were ridden in the test by professional riders, and their reactions to the stimuli were evaluated each by two judges and the rider using scores on a scale from 1 (task not concluded) to 10 (completely calm but attentive horse). Mean scores (±SD) ranged between 6.6 ± 2.4 (GATE) and 7.8 ± 2.1 (BALL), demonstrating lower means and considerably higher standard deviations than the same horses' scores from present evaluation of the trait labelled temperament (8.1 ± 0.9) or related personality traits (e.g. character: 8.3 ± 0.8). Using variance components from mixed model analysis, inter-observer agreement between the two judges was for the individual stimuli very high (0.95 (BALL), 0.96 (GATE), 0.89 (CANS)), and there was likewise high agreement between the judges' and the riders' combined scores (0.93). Repeatabilities of horses' scores were 0.72 (BALL), 0.75 (GATE), and 0.69 (CANS). Correlations to traits from the present evaluation of personality were low or non-existent, indicating that these traits are not a reflection of anxiety or fear reactivity as assessed by novel object tests. Horses' improvement in judges' combined scores from first to second test was not (P>0.1) influenced by differences in time between tests, but differed between breed-types and individual riders. Also, not surprisingly, the higher horses' scores in the first test were, the lower their improvement in the second test was (-0.45 ± 0.06 per additional score in the first test). Temperament tests using novel stimuli presented to horses under a rider may be a practical and valid tool for improving the current assessment of equine personality traits during performance tests. Considering a combination of absolute scores and horses' improvement in scores of repeated tests, rather than measuring only absolute scores yields relevant information about horses' personality, and at the same time it may prevent owners from deliberately training their horses for low reactions to the test-stimuli. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Horse; Performance test; Personality; Repeatability; Riding; Temperament test","auditory cue; correlation; genetic analysis; horse; life history trait; performance assessment; visual cue; yield response; Equidae","König v.

Based on evidence from studies linking different phenotypes to individual behaviours we hypothesize that discrete colour polymorphism can reflect personality. We tested for such a relationship in a social bird, the Gouldian finch, which shows two major head-colour morphs: red and black. Forty birds of differing head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour. Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder); (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4) boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect this to function as a signal in competitive and cooperative (social) contexts. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Boldness; Colour polymorphism; Erythrura gouldiae; Gouldian finch; Neophilia; Personality; Signalling","aggression; color; cooperative behavior; fitness; interspecific competition; laboratory method; morphology; phenotype; polymorphism; signaling; songbird; species diversity; Aves; Erythrura gouldiae","Williams, L.J.; School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Byrom Street, Liverpool L3 3AF, United Kingdom; email: L.J.Williams@2010.ljmu.ac.uk",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

The absolute and relative stability of alexithymia were evaluated in a pre-post design as part of a randomised controlled trial, controlling for several co-variates. Assessments were done with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) at baseline and follow-up of a 3-month trial of inpatient Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with or without a Shared Decision Making intervention for 187 SUD patients. Paired sample t-tests and analyses of variance were performed to assess absolute stability, intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for relative stability and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the relation between co-variates and change in alexithymia. Mean level reduction of total TAS-20 and two subfactors demonstrated no absolute stability, but change in alexithymia differed for patients with low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. Relative stability of alexithymia was moderate to high for the total population, but differed according to low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. The EuropASI ""psychiatry"" domain, covering anxiety and depression, was related to alexithymia, but CBT-related variables were not.

Intraindividual variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals. Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using 'boldness' data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications of our findings for methods currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural plasticity; Censored data; Intraindividual variability; Personality; Random regression; Repeatability; Sensitivity","behavioral response; crab; habituation; individual variation; perciform; regression analysis; sensitivity analysis; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Pagurus bernhardus; Pomacentridae; Pomacentrus wardi","Stamps, J.A.; Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: jastamps@ucdavis.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Such consistent expression of behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct behaviours. 2.Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens on aggression and mating behaviour. 3.We found that androgen concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences among individuals in aggression. 4.These findings suggest that decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an important step in the evolution of personality traits. © 2012 The Authors.

For example, some individuals are bold whereas others are shy. Within the human personality literature, the big five personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with testosterone suggested to underpin traits such as aggressiveness. In non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression may be influenced by ecology, mating system and sexual selection. While most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggression). This approach allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT scores. Furthermore, aggression scores differed between genotypes, and were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aggression; Behavioural syndrome; Behavioural type; Boldness; Exploration; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Repeatability; Sex differences","aggression; behavioral ecology; clonal organism; genetic variation; genotype; hermaphroditism; life history trait; reproductive strategy; sex-related difference; sexual selection; teleost; testosterone; aggression; animal experiment; article; clonal species; Cyprinodontiformes; exploratory behavior; female; genetic regulation; genetic variability; genotype; hermaphroditic species; male; mangrove killifish; nonhuman; personality; sex difference; sexual selection; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Disorders of Sex Development; Fundulidae; Genotype; Linear Models; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Animalia; Cyprinodontoidei; Kryptolebias marmoratus; Vertebrata","Edenbrow, M.; Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Washington Singer Labs, University of Exeter, Perry Road, Exeter EX4 4QG, United Kingdom; email: mathewedenbrow@hotmail.com",,,03766357,,BPROD,"22365923","English","Behav.

Nonetheless, phenotypic variation is commonly observed in natural populations. We tested the influences of competition and spatial heterogeneity on behavioral variation within and among populations of Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) and tested for the differential expression of trait correlations. We found that populations of D. merriami exhibited more aggression at sites with more competition. Contrary to theoretical predictions and empirical results in other systems, the sites with the greatest spatial heterogeneity and highest levels of competition did not exhibit the most behavioral variation among individuals. However, the greatest within-individual behavioral variability in boldness (response to cues of predator presence) was exhibited where spatial heterogeneity was highest. Aggression and boldness of D. merriami were highly repeatable, that is, individuals behaved in a consistent manner over time, and the two behaviors were also highly correlated. Interestingly, the strength of this correlation was greatest where the competitive community was least diverse. These findings add to increasing evidence that natural populations of animals exhibit patterns of behavioral covariance, or personality structure, and suggest that competitive variation may act to erode personality structure. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Animal personality; Behavioral syndromes; Competition; Dipodomys merriami; Environmental heterogeneity; Hot springs mountains; Merriam's kangaroo rats; Nevada; Trade-offs; USA","aggression; covariance analysis; fitness; heterogeneity; life history trait; rodent; theoretical study; thermal spring; trade-off; animal; animal behavior; article; Dipodomys; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; methodology; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Dipodomys; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Nevada; United States","Dochtermann, N.A.; Department of Biology, University of Nevada-Reno, MS314, Reno, NV 89557, United States; email: ned.dochtermann@gmail.com",,,00129658,,ECOLA,"22834374","English","Ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862271529

Here, we investigate the possibility that stable between-individual differences in startle-response durations influence fighting ability or 'resource-holding potential' (RHP) in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina. Both winners and losers showed significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual losers than for eventual winners, indicating that RHP varies with boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses inflicted more attacks on their opponent. Both repeatability and mean-level responses were changed by the experience of fighting, and these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was disrupted to a greater extent and the mean startle-response durations were subject to a greater increase than in winners. Thus, following a fight, this behavioural correlate of RHP behaves in a way similar to post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between winners and losers. Understanding the links between aggression and boldness therefore has the potential to enhance our understanding of both the evolution of animal personality and the 'winner and loser effects' of post-fight changes in RHP. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Boldness; Contest; Fighting; Personality; Resource-holding potential; Sea anemone","evolutionary biology; fighting; individual variation; life history trait; physiology; polyp; Actinia equina; Actiniaria; Animalia","Briffa, M.; Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre, University of Plymouth, PL3 8AA, United Kingdom; email: mark.briffa@plymouth.ac.uk",,"Royal Society",09628452,,PRLBA,,"English","Proc.

The reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis, however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk. Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10 m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG changed with respect to predation- and starvation-risk across treatments. This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population, and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play important roles in the evolution of personality. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Life-history variation; Personality; Plasticity; Predation; Starvation; Trade-off","environmental gradient; evolutionary biology; food quality; individual variation; life history trait; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; spatial variation; starvation; survival; trade-off; wild population; Parus major","Quinn, J.

Despite the fact that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals, quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2 components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator models) or is simply related to variation in general activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast, our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition, we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more widely used. © 2012 The Author.","activity; animal personality; antipredation behavior; Bayesian structural equation modeling; boldness; fear; repeatability; tonic immobility","antipredator defense; Bayesian analysis; ecological modeling; immobilization; numerical model; passerine; population structure; predator; predator-prey interaction; quantitative analysis; relatedness; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Euplectes afer; Passer montanus; Vertebrata","Edelaar, P.; Department of Conservation Biology, Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC), Av.

There is an expected trade-off between investing effort in making better choices and increased exposure to risk. Little is known about individuals' consistency in sampling behavior and whether it covaries with other behavior traits. Risk-taking and neophobia are documented components of behavioral syndromes; we examined whether sampling behavior is comparable. We quantified food sampling behavior (i.e., number of items sampled, visit duration, and number of items taken) of individual Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) during experimental field trials. Sampling behavior of individual jays was moderately repeatable within and between winter field seasons and was positively correlated with birds' willingness to approach a novel object and take food in front of a predator mount. These results suggest that food sampling is a measurable component in the suite of traits comprising the Steller's jay behavioral syndrome. Model selection techniques indicated that sampling behavior was more common in older, neophilic, risk-prone, larger jays, whereas jays that took multiple items were more likely to be older and risk-prone. This suggests that experience and size may additionally influence individuals' habitual foraging behaviors. © 2012 The Author.","behavioral syndrome; Cyanocitta stelleri; foraging; neophobia; risk-taking; sampling; Steller's jay","behavioral ecology; body size; experimental study; foraging behavior; life history trait; natural selection; passerine; predation risk; predator; sampling; trade-off; Animalia; Aves; Corvida; Corvidae; Cyanocitta stelleri","Black, J.M.; Department of Wildlife, Humboldt State University, 1 Harpst Street, Arcata, CA 95521, United States; email: jeff.black@humboldt.edu",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Yet, genetic and non-genetic factors are often deeply intertwined, and experiments are required to address this issue. We investigated the sources of variation of adult antipredator behaviour in the Alpine swift (Apus melba) by making use of long-term behavioural observations on parents and cross-fostered offspring. By applying an 'animal model' approach to observational data, we show that antipredator behaviour of adult Alpine swifts was significantly repeatable over lifetime (r = 0.273) and heritable (h2 = 0.146). Regression models also show that antipredator behaviours differed between colonies and sexes (females were more tame), and varied with the hour and year of capture. By applying a parent-offspring regression approach to 59 offspring that were exchanged as eggs or hatchlings between pairs of nests, we demonstrate that offspring behaved like their biological parents rather than like their foster parents when they were adults themselves.

Males were presented with paired female-male dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain a baseline measure.

Overall levels of highly aggressive behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"aggression; baseline conditions; decision making; freshwater ecosystem; male behavior; perciform; tail feather; Macropodinae","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858282215

However, there is some concern that studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the Namibian rock agama, . Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Agama planiceps; Mixed models; Namibian rock agama; Personality; Plasticity; Random regression; Repeatability","assessment method; bioassay; body size; lizard; numerical model; phenotypic plasticity; population structure; regression analysis; trap (equipment); trapping; wild population; Namibia; Agama; Agama planiceps; Animalia; Squamata","Carter, A.J.; The Fenner School of Environment and Society, The Australian National University, Acton, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; email: alecia.carter@anu.edu.au",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Potential life-history traits that explain personality variation are immune defence and growth rate. We studied whether boldness, measured as hiding behaviour, is repeatable during ontogeny in the field cricket, Gryllus integer, and if it relates to the efficiency of immune function (i.e. the capacity to encapsulate a nylon implant), growth rate, developmental time and size as an adult. Hiding behaviour was rank-order repeatable, and in general, juveniles were bolder than adults. Individuals that were cautious at early juvenile stages had higher encapsulation responses late in life compared with bold individuals. Most clearly, fast-growing individuals matured early and invested little in immune defence compared with their slower-growing conspecifics, i.e. showed patterns of a 'grow fast, die young' life-history strategy. Our results may arise from a trade-off between immunity-dependent survival and bold behaviour. Trade-offs between investment in survival and behaviour could account for the maintenance of variation in personality traits by favouring certain combinations of behavioural and life-history strategies (i.e. pace-of-life-syndromes). © 2011 The Authors.

Fish from the HR line have been suggested to display a more diverse behavioral repertoire in challenging situations than the LR counterpart. The present study addressed whether such variation in behavioral flexibility traits was evident in different experimental settings using these selection lines. The fish were subjected to three sets of challenges (novel object test, resident-intruder test and confinement stressor test), all which were repeated a week later. Introducing a novel object evoked a divergent behavioral response in association with feeding: fish from the LR line displayed consistently suppressed feed intake while the HR fish remained unaffected. This observation was found to be repeatable along with attack latency and movement activity from the resident-intruder and confinement stressor tests.

We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences. © The Author 2011.","antipredation behavior; behavioral plasticity; boldness; foraging; natural system; personality; redshank; risk-taking; starvation-predation risk trade-off; vigilance","aggression; antipredator defense; decision making; foraging behavior; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; pristine environment; starvation; wader; Animalia; Tringa; Tringa totanus","Couchoux, C.; School of Biology, Bute Building, University of St Andrews, Fife, KY16 9TS, United Kingdom; email: charline5@msn.com",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

In most animals, juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets, adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets. Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when they were nymphs, versus when they were adults. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Boldness; Field cricket; Gryllus; Metamorphosis; Personality; Sex differences","adaptation; cricket; fitness; functional morphology; hormone; identification method; juvenile; maturation; metamorphosis; ontogeny; physiological response; reproductive cost; risk factor; sex-related difference; Animalia; Gryllidae; Gryllinae; Gryllus","Hedrick, A.

Difficulty in their reliable assessment has been a barrier. A screening and assessment tool incorporating a self-information processing framework, the Ideas of Reference Interview Scale (IRIS), was developed and validated in patients with early psychosis. Methods: Comprehensive review of IOR/DOR phenomena in the literature and pilot interviews were conducted for scale item development. Self-referential themes were summarized into 15 items. A consecutive sample of 137 outpatients with early psychosis was interviewed using IRIS. Their IOR/DOR experiences were also rated independently by clinicians on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and self-rated using the IOR subscale on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Inter-rater reliability of IRIS was examined in a subsample of 15 participants. Results: IRIS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.80), inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.95), and divergent validity with other symptoms. IRIS correlated satisfactorily with the IOR/DOR item or subscale on SAPS and SPQ (Spearman's rho = 0.71 and 0.47, respectively). Discussion: IRIS provided a reliable high-resolution tool for progressing single-symptom research into IOR/DOR, a potential target feature of schizophrenia. The scale allows future investigation into self-referential processing and detailed phenomenological comparison in different clinical, subclinical, and healthy populations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment; Delusions; Psychotic disorders; Schizophrenia; Self-reference","adult; affect; article; behavior disorder; bizarre behavior; delusion; delusion of reference; divergent validity; early psychosis; experience; female; hallucination; human; ideas of reference; Ideas of Reference Interview Scale; internal consistency; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; mental disease; outpatient; persecutory delusion; positive syndrome; prevalence; priority journal; psychologic assessment; psychologic test; psychosis; rating scale; Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms; Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire; screening test; self concept; semi structured interview; thought broadcasting; thought disorder; validation study; validity; Adolescent; Adult; Delusions; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Mass Screening; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychotic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult","Wong, G.H.Y.; Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Block J, Pokfulam, Hong Kong; email: ghywong@hku.hk",,,09209964,,SCRSE,"22244183","English","Schizophr.

Pike swimming activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation. However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the state-dependent personality hypothesis.

In particular, one important question concerns whether personality should be established from the existence of complex behavioral syndromes (a suite of correlated behavioral traits) or could be more easily deduced from a single variable. In that context, it has recently been suggested that handling stress, measured through breathing rate during handling, could be a good descriptor of personality, at least in passerine birds. The authors experimentally investigated to what extent handling stress was correlated with personality in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), as assessed from a suite of repeatable behavioral traits, including activity, exploratory behavior, neophobia, and reaction to startle. Although breathing rate was repeatable across individuals, it was not related to any behavioral trait, suggesting that it cannot be used to quickly predict personality, at least in zebra finches. Breathing rate during handling, in addition, was related to morphology, questioning the fact that breathing rate during handling reflects personality irrespective of individual state. The authors suggest that inference on global personality from a reduced number of traits should be performed with caution. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Behavioral syndrome; Bootstrap; Breathing rate; Exploration; Temperament","animal; article; breathing rate; exploratory behavior; female; finch; mental stress; personality; physiology; psychological aspect; temperament; Animals; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Finches; Personality; Respiratory Rate; Stress, Psychological; Temperament","David, M.; Équipe Écologie Évolutive, UMR CNRS 5561 Biogéosciences, 6 boulevard Gabriel, 21000 Dijon, France; email: morgan.david@u-bourgogne.fr",,,07357036,,JCPPA,"21767006","English","J.

We made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010, measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling. Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong effect of area or openness on either flightinitiation distance or distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches. Because flight-initiation distance is often used to identify distances at which human behavior disrupts wildlife, we estimate its mean (21.8 m) and the distance at which 75%, 95%, and 99% of the Bobolinks flushed (28, 40, and 59 m, respectively). © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.","Area sensitivity; Behavioral syndrome; Boldness; Fear; Intraclass correlation coefficient; Personality","Aves; Dolichonyx; Dolichonyx oryzivorus","Keyel, A.C.; Department of Biology, Tufts University, 163 Packard Ave., Medford, MA 02155, United States; email: skeyel@gmail.com",,,00105422,,CNDRA,,"English","Condor",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858407560

To date, few attempts have been made to explore whether individual variation in behavioural plasticity exists, either within or between populations. 3.We assayed 'exploration behaviour' among wild-caught individual great tits Parus major when exposed to a novel environment room in four populations across Europe. We quantified levels of individual variation within and between populations in average behaviour, and in behavioural plasticity with respect to (i) repeated exposure to the room (test sequence), (ii) the time of year in which the assays were conducted and (iii) the interval between successive tests, all of which indicate habituation to novelty and are therefore of functional significance. 4.Consistent individual differences ('I') in behaviour were present in all populations; repeatability (range: 0·34-0·42) did not vary between populations. Exploration behaviour was also plastic, increasing with test sequence - but less so when the interval between subsequent tests was relatively large - and time of year; populations differed in the magnitude of plasticity with respect to time of year and test interval. Finally, the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour increased significantly from first to repeat tests in all populations. Individuals with high initial scores showed greater increases in exploration score than individuals with low initial scores; individual by environment interaction ('I×E') with respect to test sequence did not vary between populations. 5.Our findings imply that individual variation in both average level of behaviour and behavioural plasticity may generally characterize wild great tit populations and may largely be shaped by mechanisms acting within populations. Experimental approaches are now needed to confirm that individual differences in behavioural plasticity (habituation) - not other hidden biological factors - caused the observed patterns of I×E. Establishing the evolutionary causes and consequences of this variation in habituation to novelty constitutes an exciting future challenge. © 2011 The Authors.

To this end, we used 1129 nest observation periods from 118 nests across 4 populations to examine how parental nest visitation varied according to sex, food availability, and offspring need (brood size and age) in the stitchbird (hihi: Notiomystis cincta). Males increased their provisioning proportional to brood size regardless of food availability, whereas females did not increase provisioning to larger broods unless food supplemented. Male provisioning consistently followed the age-dependent energy requirements of the nestlings, whereas females showed little or no brood age-provisioning relationships. Thus, males were more sensitive than females to changes in the energy demands of their offspring; however, this was probably because females were already providing food at a high rate and could not respond to increased demand unless given additional food. Sex and habitat-specific repeatability estimates of parental effort suggest that variation in female provisioning behavior tends to be driven by differences in the local environment, whereas variation in male provisioning is more related to differences in individual quality. These sex-specific responses of parental care can be largely explained by the relative benefits of provisioning; females provisioned at a high rate to offspring they knew to be their own, based on available resources. In contrast, when food was abundant, males did not increase their provisioning to offspring probably because of the opportunity for additional matings via forced extrapair copulations. © 2011 The Author.","chick feeding; parental effort; parental investment; sealed bid; supplementary feeding; translocation","age class; bioenergetics; brood size; environmental conditions; extra-pair copulation; food availability; food provisioning; food supplementation; individual variation; life history trait; maternal care; parental investment; passerine; paternal care; resource availability; sex-related difference; sexual conflict; translocation; Notiomystis cincta","Low, M.; Department of Ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7044, 75007 Uppsala, Sweden; email: matt.low@slu.se",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

The individual quality hypothesis proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the 'compensatory' hypothesis proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated, because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as a random effect, we found that consistent differences between individuals explained approximately 55% of variation in aggressiveness and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of each are context dependent. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural reaction norm; Nest defence; Parental care; Repeatability; Tachycineta bicolor; Tree swallow","aggression; behavioral response; environmental conditions; fitness; nest guarding; parental care; reproductive success; songbird; Aves; Tachycineta; Tachycineta bicolor","Betini, G.S.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; email: betinig@uoguelph.ca",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

One increasingly prevalent view is that realized competitive ability varies because it represents alternative strategies that arise because of the costs associated with competitiveness. Here we use a population of great tits (Parus major) to explore whether individual differences in competitive ability when foraging can be explained by two traits that have previously been linked to alternative behavioural strategies: the personality trait 'exploration behaviour' and a simple cognitive trait, 'innovative problem-solving performance'. We assayed these traits under standardized conditions in captivity and then measured competitive ability at feeders with restricted access in the wild. Competitive ability was repeatable within individual males across days and correlated positively with exploration behaviour, representing the first such demonstration of a link between a personality trait and both competitive ability and food intake in the wild. Competitive ability was also simultaneously negatively correlated with problemsolving performance; individuals who were poor competitors were good at problem-solving. Rather than being the result of variation in 'individual quality', our results support the hypothesis that individual variation in competitive ability can be explained by alternative behavioural strategies. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Alternative strategies; Competitive ability; Exploration behaviour; Innovative problem-solving; Parus major; Personality","cognition; fitness; food intake; foraging behavior; individual variation; life history trait; passerine; resource allocation; trade-off; wild population; Parus major","Cole, E.

This phenomenon appears to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even exhibit 'consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics. Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in both courtship and aggressive situations. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","behavioral flexibility; consistent individual differences; decision-making; repeatability; Siamese fighting fish","Betta splendens; Macropodinae","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, Biddeford, ME, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860233488

Spider societies lack discrete morphological castes, but colony constituents can differ along any number of trait axes (e.g. body size). Here we tested for consistent individual differences in social tendency in five tropical spider species (genus Anelosimus). We further determined the extent to which social tendency is correlated with other aspects of an individual's behaviour that might reflect division of labour within colonies. We found that all five species showed repeatable within-species variation in social tendency, and increased social tendency was correlated with reduced aggressiveness towards prey and diminished boldness towards an aversive stimulus (i.e. test species shared a similar 'behavioural syndrome' of aggressiveness/sociality). Furthermore, colonies of some species (e.g. Anelosimus eximius, Anelosimus oritoyacu) appeared to be composed of varying proportions of two 'behavioural types', whereas other species (Anelosimus domingo, Anelosimus guacamayos) showed a more continuous distribution of trait values. Interestingly, irrespective of species, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of aggressive colony constituents and group size, where larger colonies tended to have fewer aggressive females. Our results indicate that (1) the majority of social Anelosimus show similar within-species behavioural variation and syndromes, and (2) colony size either mediates the expression/development of individuals' behavioural types, or is regulated by the frequency of behavioural types. © 2011.","Anelosimus eximius; Anelosimus studiosus; Behavioural syndrome; Personality; Temperament; Theridiidae","aggression; behavioral ecology; body size; caste; group behavior; group size; interspecific variation; labor division; life history trait; morphology; spider; Amazonia; Anelosimus; Anelosimus domingo; Anelosimus eximius; Anelosimus studiosus; Animalia; Araneae; Theridiidae","Pruitt, J.N.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, 101 Clapp Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States; email: Agelenopsis@gmail.com",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Criticism of the instrument has been increasing. A new instrument, the European Adolescent Assessment Dialogue (EuroADAD) that builds on ADAD's strengths but seeks to address its limitations is now available, but has not been subjected to comprehensive psychometric evaluation. Objective: To examine the psychometric properties of the EuroADAD across various settings in adolescent populations who developed or were at a high risk of developing substance use and psychosocial adaptation problems. Participants and Settings: Three of the samples were collected in Hungary, including: institutionalized youths from juvenile residential facility (n = 295); adolescents from outpatient psychiatry facility (n = 278), and controls (n = 59). An additional sample was collected in the Netherlands, and consisted of adolescent boys from an independent residential institution for youth with severe behavioral problems (n = 51). Procedure: The EuroADAD was administered by trained interviewers. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and self-report questionnaires. Results: Reliability: the intraclass correlation was high for all domains of the EuroADAD; reliability analyses indicated good test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Validity: difference among study samples was significant (p < 0.05) for the majority of the domains, with juvenile institution and psychiatric outpatient subjects exhibiting higher severity in most areas compared to controls. The Hungarian and Dutch samples were comparable, expect for the legal domain, due to the higher severity of behavioral problems in the Dutch sample. Several domains of the instrument, including 'alcohol', 'drugs' and 'legal' showed an association with trait aggression as measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and with Novelty Seeking on the Cloninger Temperament and Character Inventory. Conclusion: Based on the pattern and significance of group differences, and correlations with other measures, the scale has good criterion, and convergent and discriminant construct validity. The EuroADAD is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of alcohol and drug use, and related psychosocial problems in adolescents. Copyright © 2011 S.

This characteristic likely modulates the response of the animal to environments and social situations, and is perhaps best viewed as a component of its personality. We assessed temperament using three objective measuring tools, to determine if correlations exist between these and a traditional subjective evaluation. The tools used were strain gauges, a ""movement measuring device"" (MMD), and a chute exit timer. Four hundred steers were used. Exit time was correlated with values recorded with the MMD and absolute strain forces, and MMD values were related to absolute strain forces. When the animals were classified as ""calm"" or ""wild"" based on their subjective scoring, these two groups differed in their mean exit times, MMD values and absolute strain forces. The three objective measures yielded statistically correlated results between tests and across repetitions, and therefore may quantify correlated aspects of a personality trait (i.e., temperament). The objective scores were related to the traditional subjective score, but they provide the advantage of eliminating observer bias and may offer better tools for temperament selection. Significant positive relationships of daily gain with subjective score and MMD values indicate that traditional subjective scoring techniques can be replaced with more repeatable objective measures when temperaments are assessed for performance studies.","Beef cattle; Exit time; Movement measuring device; Strain gauge; Temperament","Animalia; Bos","Stookey, J.M.; Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Saskatchewan, 52 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5B4, Canada; email: joseph.stookey@usask.ca",,,00083984,,CNJNA,,"English","Can.

It has never been assessed whether these relationships exist in calmer Bos taurus breeds in systems where handling is more frequent. Such systems predominate in some countries where beef production is a major agricultural activity. During fattening, 144 crossbred cattle from Limousin and Aberdeen Angus sires were assessed for temperament using 4 approaches: response to movement along a race (race score; 4 occasions), restraint in a crush (crush score; 4 occasions), flight speed from the crush (flight speed; 4 occasions), and isolation in a pen with a human (isolation score; 1 occasion in yr 1, 2 occasions in yr 2). Measurements of ADG were made between birth and slaughter and between 16 and 18 mo of age during fattening. Fattening occurred indoors on a complete mixed diet fed for ad libitum intake. Meat quality was measured by pH, color, and Volodkevitch shear force and by a sensory panel. The repeatability of temperament traits was 0.17 (race score), 0.35 (crush score), 0.51 (flight speed), and 0.36 (isolation score). The proportion of the total variance of temperament traits attributable to the sire and the social group was low (0.003 to 0.402). However, the sire did affect behavior in all tests apart from the crush score (ranging from P = 0.02 to P < 0.001). Correlations between behavior in the different tests (ranging from r = 0.21 to 0.54, and P = 0.02 to P < 0.001) apart from between-flight speed and isolation score indicate that fearful behavior was consistently shown across assessment methods. A calm response in the crush score test was associated with a greater ADG during fattening (P = 0.05), whereas a calm response during the isolation test was associated with a greater ADG in cold carcass weight (P = 0.02). Animals with a calm isolation score had less tender meat as judged by the sensory panel (P = 0.03), but no other effects were apparent between temperament and meat quality measures, although several tendencies (0.06 ≤ P ≤ 0.10) were found. Temperament did not appear to relate to meat quality in this study of frequently handled Bos Taurus genotypes, which is in contrast to other studies using different beef production systems. Genetic correlations between temperament and meat quality under these conditions could, although not measured in this study, still exist in the absence of phenotypic correlations. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.

While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality. Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we suggest there is merit in modelling both within- and among-individual variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models. Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects, which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory. Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e.g., mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual aggressiveness. © 2011 Wilson et al.",,"aggression; aggressiveness; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; behavioral science; biological trait; controlled study; fish; intraspecific competition; mathematical model; nonhuman; Xiphophorus helleri; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Body Weight; Cyprinodontiformes; Male; Models, Biological; Personality; Principal Component Analysis; Research","Wilson, A.

We report here on the behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations. Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration, integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 ± 66.6 (mean ± 1S.E.) and 678.2 ± 115.8. ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8 and 2.2. ng/mL respectively, P<. 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased propensity for locomotory behaviours (P= 0.001), maintenance behaviours (P= 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P= 0.04) over the period of captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P<. 0.001) decreased, probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability (Repeatability. = 0.592 ± 0.084, P<. 0.0001). Significant repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability. = 0.619 ± 0.166, P= 0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability. = 0.368 ± 0.166, P= 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response at release (P= 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P= 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity, may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Behaviour; Captive birds; Reintroduction; Stress; Temperament; Translocation","behavioral response; blood; captive population; captivity; capture method; habituation; hormone; individual variation; locomotion; passerine; principal component analysis; reintroduction; starvation; sterol; survival; translocation; vocalization; wild population; wildlife management; Aves; Turdus merula","Adams, N.J.; Department of Natural Sciences, Unitec Institute of Technology, Private Bag 92025, Auckland, New Zealand; email: nadams@unitec.ac.nz",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

We tested this idea by analyzing parental care reaction norms in a bird that exhibits biparental care. Personality in provisioning behavior existed (r IC = 0.11) and persisted despite being reduced after accounting for IC individual differences in environment. Plasticity was also evident and differed between the sexes. Male visit rate was associated with changes in brood size and time of day, but female visit rate was associated with changes in nestling age and date. In both sexes changes in visit rate were positively correlated with changes in their partner's visit rate. Both sexes also exhibited multidimensional reaction norms; interaction terms revealed that within-individual visit rates increased more steeply with brood size when nestlings were older, and the effect of the partner's visit rate was sensitive to variation in date, precipitation, and the focal bird's age. Individuals also varied in how they responded (reaction norm slope) to changes in nestling age and partner visits. Moreover, parental personality was interdependent with individual plasticity in several ways. Individuals of both sexes with a high visit rate also responded more positively to changes in nestling age, and males also showed this pattern with changes in partner visit rate. Explicit use of the behavioral reaction norm integrated personality and plasticity, revealed that these are not opposing concepts, and stimulated new hypotheses about sexual conflict over care and provisioning as a life-history trait. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.","Behavioral reaction norm; Behavioral syndrome; Life history; Phenotypic plasticity; Provisioning; Repeatability; Sexual conflict","bird; brood size; hypothesis testing; individual variation; life history trait; nestling; parental care; phenotypic plasticity; precipitation (climatology); reaction norm; sex-related difference; sexual conflict; age distribution; animal; article; female; male; maternal behavior; nesting; paternal behavior; physiology; reproduction; sparrow; time; United States; weather; Age Distribution; Animals; Female; Kentucky; Male; Maternal Behavior; Nesting Behavior; Paternal Behavior; Reproduction; Sparrows; Time Factors; Weather; Aves","Westneat, D.

Here we examine whether the production of bird calls, in addition to bird songs, is repeatable and related to exploratory behavior, using the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) as a model. We assessed the exploratory behavior of individual birds in a novel environment task. We then recorded the vocalizations and accompanying motor behavior of both male and female chickadees, over the course of several days, in two different contexts: a control condition with no playback and a stressful condition where chick-a-dee mobbing calls were played to individual birds. We found that several vocalizations and behaviors were repeatable within both a control and a stressful context, and across contexts. While there was no relationship between vocal output and exploratory behavior in the control context, production of alarm and chick-a-dee calls in the stressful condition was positively associated with exploratory behavior. These findings are important because they show that bird calls, in addition to bird song, are an aspect of personality, in that calls are consistent both within and across contexts, and covary with other personality measures (exploration). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Alarm call; Animal personality; Black-capped chickadee; Exploratory behavior; Repeatability; Vocalization","alarm signal; behavioral ecology; mobbing; research work; songbird; vocalization; animal; animal behavior; article; environment; exploratory behavior; female; individuality; male; personality; physiology; songbird; vocalization; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Environment; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Individuality; Male; Personality; Songbirds; Vocalization, Animal; Animalia; Aves; Paridae; Parus atricapillus; Passeri","Sturdy, C.B.; Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, P-217 Biological Sciences Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; email: csturdy@ualberta.ca",,,00281042,,NATWA,"21928067","English","Naturwissenschaften",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054816378

The PBAC assesses five cognitive domains: working memory/executive control; lexical retrieval/language; visuospatial/ visuoconstructional operations; verbal/visual episodic memory; and behavior/social comportment. A revised version of the PBAC was administered to 198 participants including patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=46) and four groups of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes: behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD; n=65), semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (svPPA; n=22), non-fluent/agrammatic-variant PPA (nfaPPA; n=23), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS; n=42), and a group of normal controls (n=15). The total PBAC score was highly correlated with the MMSE. The criterion validity of the PBAC was assessed relative to standard neuropsychological test performance. Using standard neuropsychological test performance as a criterion, the total PBAC score accurately identified the presence and severity of dementia.

Such 'personality' affects fitness and has therefore become an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0. 21-0. 93) in at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of which consisted of social traits and were labelled 'sociability', 'positive affect' and 'equitability'. The two non-social behaviour factors were labelled 'anxiety' and 'activity'. The factor scores were analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor scores in all traits except 'sociability'. The factor scores differed also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a broad range of social and non-social behaviours. The study highlights the importance of assessing personality in the social behaviour, especially in cohesive social species, as only then can we understand the consequences of personality in socially living species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Activity; Anxiety; Chimpanzee; Pan troglodytes; Personality; Sociability","activity pattern; captive population; eusociality; factor analysis; fitness; life history trait; primate; social behavior; temporal analysis; zoo; Animalia; Pan; Pan troglodytes","Koski, S.

All steers had a portion of Hereford, Angus, or both as well as varying percentages of Simmental, Charolais, Limousin, Gelbvieh, Red Angus, and MARC III composite. Because the steers were slaughtered on various dates each year and the animals thus varied in days on feed, BW and feed data were adjusted to a 140-d feeding period basis. Adjustment of measures of feed efficiency [G:F or residual feed intake (RFI), intake adjusted for metabolic body size, and BW gain] for body fatness recorded at slaughter had little effect on the results of analyses. Average daily gain was less heritable (0.26) than was midtest BW (MBW; 0.35). Measures of feed intake had greater estimates of heritability, with 140-d DMI at 0.40 and RFI at 0.52; the heritability estimate for G:F was 0.27. Flight speed (FS), as an indicator of temperament, had an estimated heritability of 0.34 and a repeatability of 0.63. As expected, a strong genetic (0.86) correlation was estimated between ADG and MBW; genetic correlations were less strong between DMI and ADG or MBW (0.56 and 0.71). Residual feed intake and DMI had a genetic correlation of 0.66. Indexes for phenotypic RFI and genotypically restricted RFI (no correlation with BW gain) were compared with simple economic indexes incorporating feed intake and growth to elucidate expected selection responses under different criteria. In general, few breed differences were detected across the various measurements. Heterosis contributed to greater DMI, RFI, and MBW, but it did not significantly affect ADG, G:F, or FS. Balancing output (growth) with input costs (feed) is needed in practicing selection, and FS would not be recommended as an indicator trait for selection to change feed efficiency. An index including BW gain and RFI produced the best economic outcome. © 2011 American Society of Animal Science.","Cattle; Feed intake; Flight speed; Genetic variation; Growth; Selection","animal; animal behavior; article; body weight; cattle; cross breeding; eating; genetics; male; physiology; psychological aspect; quantitative trait; randomization; regression analysis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Weight; Cattle; Crosses, Genetic; Eating; Male; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Random Allocation; Regression Analysis; Animalia; Bos","Nielsen, M.

Here, we consider individual variation in consistency of choice (termed here ""choosiness""), as expressed during habitat choice. We repeatedly tested the responses of female Western Black Widows, Latrodectus hesperus, to two cues of habitat quality: prey chemical cues and variation in web site illuminance. We estimated females' response by the distance they positioned themselves from (1) the source of prey chemical cues and (2) the darkest edge of our test arena. Individuals with low variance in their responses are deemed more ""choosy"", whereas individuals with high variance are deemed less ""choosy"". Generally, most females initiated web construction near the source of the prey chemical cues and tended to place themselves in low-light conditions. However, we detected strong, repeatable differences in females' intensity of response, and within-individual variance of response (i.e., choosiness) was correlated across situations: females with highly consistent responses towards cricket chemical cues also exhibited highly consistent responses towards variation in light conditions. When deprived of food for extended periods, females were indistinguishable in their responses towards prey chemical cues, but tended to initiate web construction in brighter lighting conditions. Food-deprived females universally exhibited higher variance and diminished consistency in their responses (i.e., they were less choosy). Additionally, higher choosiness was associated with greater mass loss during choice trials, suggesting choosiness is energetically costly. Our results demonstrate that consistency of response to environmental cues is yet another element of behavior that varies among individuals and variation in choosiness could beget speed/quality trade-offs during animal decision making. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Aggression; Choice experiment; Habitat selection; Rapid environmental change; Theridiidae","aggression; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; chemical cue; cricket; environmental change; habitat quality; habitat selection; prey capture; research work; spider; trade-off; Animalia; Latrodectus; Latrodectus hesperus; Theridiidae","Pruitt, J.

Studies on the effects of 17α-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) on behaviour, however, rarely examine these effects over multiple trials, across time, or across contexts. In addition, it is possible that individuals vary in their sensitivity to EE2 and individuals may differ in the degree to which their behaviour is affected. The study of consistent individual differences in behaviour has grown in popularity in recent years perhaps because of the evolutionary questions this behavioural variation raises. Adult male threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from an anadromous population repeatedly received the simultaneous presentation of a dummy male and dummy female conspecific both before and after exposure to a short-term, nominal (15ngL -1) concentration of 17α-ethinyloestradiol (EE2). These before and after measures were then compared against one another as well as against responses of males in a control group that was not exposed to EE2. Courtship, aggression, and nesting behaviours were all affected by EE2 exposure. In addition, behavioural consistency over trials was markedly reduced after EE2 exposure, as shown by lower repeatability values in the after exposure measures and in weaker correlations between the before and after exposure measures in the EE2 group compared to the control group. This suggests that male threespine stickleback vary in their sensitivity to EE2. This study is one of the first to examine the effects of short-term EE2 exposure on behaviour across trials and has important implications for population-level fitness consequences of xenooestrogens. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","17α-Ethinyloestradiol (EE2); Aggression; Consistent individual differences; Courtship; Endocrine disruptors; Threespine stickleback","endocrine disruptor; ethinylestradiol; aggression; concentration (composition); correlation; courtship; endocrine disruptor; estrogenic compound; fish; nesting behavior; pollution exposure; aggression; aquatic species; article; behavior change; concentration (parameters); controlled study; courtship; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; female; gasterosteus aculeatus; male; nesting; nonhuman; priority journal; reproductive fitness; sensitivity analysis; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Courtship; Endocrine Disruptors; Ethinyl Estradiol; Male; Nesting Behavior; Smegmamorpha; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Gasterosteus; Gasterosteus aculeatus","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,0166445X,,AQTOD,"21975189","English","Aquat.

Several studies suggest that kin selection alone cannot be invoked to explain variation in helping for many species, but there have been few explicit tests of this under controlled conditions. Here, we investigated whether relatedness to the breeding pair or consistent individual differences in behaviours explained variation in helping by the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. We established standardized social groups consisting of a breeding pair and one related (r = 0.5) and one unrelated (r = 0) helper. Two forms of helping, territory maintenance and territory defence, were measured repeatedly under controlled conditions: helping was variable between, but consistent within, individuals. Furthermore, there was some evidence that helpers that carried out more maintenance also performed more defence. Contrary to the kin selection hypothesis, relatedness did not predict the amount or variety of helping executed. Risk responsiveness, activity levels and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals, so constituted 'behavioural types' (or personality traits), but were uncorrelated with each other. More aggressive, risk-prone or more active helpers participated in more territory defence than submissive, risk-averse or inactive helpers. Risk-prone individuals contributed more to territory maintenance than risk-averse helpers. Overall, differences in behavioural type, rather than relatedness, explained most variation in helping behaviour in N. pulcher. This study highlights the importance of considering consistent individual differences in behaviour for predicting participation and performance in complex social interactions. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggressiveness; Boldness; Kin selection; Neolamprologus pulcher; Personality; Territory defence","aggression; behavioral ecology; defense behavior; kin selection; perciform; relatedness; reproductive behavior; risk factor; territory; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher","Arnold, K.E.; Environment Department, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, United Kingdom; email: Kathryn.Arnold@york.ac.uk",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

That is, an animal's fitness may be influenced by variation in the mental representations it has formed of its environment. Studying such variation is challenging because it involves documenting inherently subjective phenomena. However, observations of behaviour may provide objective descriptions of mental representations. We used the behaviour of Frontinella communis spiders after removal of prey from their webs as an assay of the contents of their memories of the prey. Spiders searched for lost prey, exerting greater effort in searching for larger prey, and distinguishing between the object of the search and old prey remnants. We thus infer that spider memories included information about prey features such as size or quality. We found significant repeatability in the spiders' searching behaviour, suggesting repeatability in memory content. As an indication of consistent between-individual differences in searching and memory, these repeatability estimates suggest that selection may act to shape mental representations and their relationship with foraging behaviour. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Animal cognition; Cognitive ecology; Foraging; Web spider","animal; article; cognition; female; memory; predation; spider; Animals; Cognition; Female; Memory; Predatory Behavior; Spiders; Animalia; Araneae; Frontinella communis; Linyphiidae","Rodríguez, R.

Despite burgeoning interest in such animal personality variation, studies on invertebrates are scarce, and studies on clonal invertebrates nonexistent. This is surprising given the obvious advantages of using invertebrates/clones to tackle the crucial question why such consistent behavioral differences exist. Here we show that individuals of clonal pea aphids exhibit consistent behavioral differences in their escape responses to a predator attack (dropping vs. nondropping off a plant). However, behavior was not repeatable at the clonal level.

Behavioural measurements included scores and linear measurements for reactivity (R), activity (A), time to calm down (T) and emotionality (E), recorded during the approach (1) and/or during confrontation with the stimulus (2). Sixty-five horses were each confronted 3 times (1 ridden, 1 led, 1 free running in balanced order) with 3 novel and/or sudden stimuli. Mixed model analysis indicated that leading resulted in the lowest (P < 0.05 throughout) reactions as measured by A1, A2, E1, E2, R2, and pNN50 while riding produced the strongest (A1, T2, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) or medium (E1, E2, R2) reactions. Free running resulted either in the strongest (A2, E1, E2, R2) or in the lowest (A1, T2, HR, RMSSD, pNN50) reactions. The repeatability across tests for HR (0.57), but not for RMSSD (0.23) or pNN50 (0.25) was higher than for any behavioural measurement: the latter ranged from values below 0.10 (A1, A2, T2) to values between 0.30 and 0.45 (E1, E2, R2). Overall, the results show that a rider or handler influences, but not completely masks, the horses' intrinsic behaviour in a temperament test, and this influence appeared to be stronger on behavioural variables and heart rate variability than on the horses' heart rates. Taking both practical considerations and repeatabilities into account, reactivity appears to be the most valuable parameter. Emotionality and heart rate can also yield valid results reflecting additional dimensions of temperament although their practical relevance may be less obvious. If a combination of observed variables is chosen with care, a valid assessment of a horse's temperament may be possible in all types of tests. However, in practice, tests that resemble the practical circumstances most closely, i.e. testing riding horses under a rider, should be chosen. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Equine; Heart rate variability; Horseback riding; Human-animal interaction; Reactivity; Temperament","animal behavior; animal experiment; article; auditory stimulation; emotionality; exercise; female; heart rate variability; horse; horseback riding; male; nonhuman; priority journal; tactile stimulation; visual stimulation; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Handling (Psychology); Heart Rate; Horses; Male; Statistics as Topic; Temperament","König von Borstel, U.; Department of Animal Science, University of Goettingen, Albrecht-Thaer-Weg 3, 37075 Goettingen, Germany; email: koenigvb@gwdg.de",,,00319384,,PHBHA,"21616087","English","Physiol.

From a signal design perspective, contact calls typically exhibit acoustic features that make them easily localizable and encode information about individual or group identity. Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) are unusual among vespertilionids in that they often emit a loud, partially audible frequency-modulated social call several times in rapid succession while in flight. This call appears to function as a contact call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and perform circular flights before entering a crevice roost. However, the degree to which pallid bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and what information is provided in the call is unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate pallid bat calling behavior to determine if calls attract roostmates or elicit responses from them and provide sufficient information for individual recognition. In playback studies, we found that contact calls elicit calls and approaches and that free-flying bats respond more to familiar than unfamiliar calls. In addition, analysis of frequency and temporal measurements of calls collected from multiple sites and spectral cross correlation analysis of calls recorded from the same radiotagged bats on multiple evenings revealed that the frequency pattern of contact calls is highly repeatable over time within individuals but exhibits significant differences among individuals. Thus, contact call structure appears to be unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these calls well-suited for roostmate recognition. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Communication; Fission-fusion; Signature call; Vespertilionid bat","bat; calling behavior; conspecific; flight activity; frequency analysis; group behavior; mate recognition; movement; roost site; roosting; temporal analysis; Antrozous; Antrozous pallidus; Aves; Mammalia; Vespertilionidae","Arnold, B.

However, very little is known about the behavioural processes involved in ingesting food such as meal duration, feeding frequency and latency to start eating. This study aims at the characterization of feeding behaviour in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus in terms of consistency of individual differences over time and correlation with performance traits. Seventy-two individuals were individually housed for 27 days. These fish had three different weight (age) categories: low (initial body weight: 61.32 ± 5.97. g), middle (151.19 ± 4.26. g) and high (265.90 ± 19.13. g), each containing 24 fish. Daily feed intake was recorded per fish. On days 8, 15 and 21 feeding behaviour was assessed by measuring the latency to start feeding (LAT, min), the total feeding time (TFT, min) and the number of feeding acts (NFA). In the end of the experimental period, fish were weighed and individual growth rate and feed efficiency (measured as residual feed intake) determined. Results show that feeding latency and the number of feeding acts have significant repeatability estimates for all weight classes. These estimates were, however, low in magnitude and decreased as the weight class increased. The correlation between the different feeding behaviours showed that individuals that are more active during feeding (higher NFA) on average, start to consume their feed earlier (lower LAT) and for longer periods (higher TFT). The number of feeding acts was significantly correlated with both feed intake and growth in all size classes. The residual feed intake was correlated with feeding latency only in the small weight class. These results showed that individual differences in feeding behaviour have low repeatability estimates and can partly explain differences in performance traits in juveniles of Nile tilapia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Appetite; Consistency; Feeding strategy; Individual differences; Maintenance requirements; Repeatability","age class; body mass; cichlid; feeding behavior; food intake; growth rate; individual variation; juvenile; life history trait; performance assessment; temporal variation; Oreochromis niloticus","Martins, C.I.M.; Centro de Ciências Do Mar, Universidade Do Algarve, Campus de Gambelas, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal; email: cimartins@ualg.pt",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

It is usually assumed that such consistent individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat. Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect 'animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A. equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in species with simple nervous systems. © 2011 Briffa, Greenaway.",,"animal behavior; article; body size; controlled study; lifespan; microhabitat; nervous system; nonhuman; sea anemone; startle reflex; temperature measurement; water temperature; Anemone; animal; personality; physiology; reproducibility; temperature; United Kingdom; Actinia equina; Actiniaria; Anemone; Animalia; Cnidaria; Anemone; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Great Britain; Personality; Reproducibility of Results; Startle Reaction; Temperature","Briffa, M.; Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Plymouth, United Kingdom; email: mark.briffa@plymouth.ac.uk",,,19326203,,,"21755015","English","PLoS ONE",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959984915

One factor that could account for a portion of the residual variation is animal personality or consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, but no study has examined this relationship in a free-living population of mammals. In this paper, we test for a relationship between RMR and CIDs in activity in live-trapped meadow voles Microtus pennsylvanicus after controlling for the effect of body mass. We quantified the activity levels of voles both in an unfamiliar environment and for the first 2min in the metabolic apparatus, and then measured RMR using open-flow respirometry. As expected, there was a linear relationship between RMR and body mass, and we found strong evidence for repeatable differences in activity levels between individuals. However, contrary to the hypothesis, we did not identify a significant correlation between CIDs in behaviour and RMR after controlling for body mass. Our results suggest that, at least within species, higher activity levels may not require a greater investment in energetically demanding tissues or increased capacity for processing of energy. Alternatively, if a relationship exists, our inability to detect it may reflect a weak behavioural signal in noisy RMR data that are influenced by many factors. Our results could also reflect an artefact of individual responses to stress or a sampling bias towards more exploratory individuals in animals captured by live-trapping. © 2011 The Authors.

In recent years, individually distinct coping styles have also been observed in several species of fish. These individual differences may result in suboptimal production and compromised welfare in aquaculture. An approach to overcome these problems could be to sort fish and optimise rearing conditions according to coping style. It has been previously demonstrated that the proactive and reactive coping styles in fish can be characterised by contrasting behavioural responses to hypoxia. Two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) strains, bred for a low- (LR) and high- (HR) cortisol response to a standardized stressor, are suggested to resemble the proactive and reactive coping styles respectively. Therefore, these fish provided an opportunity for verifying a method for sorting fish with respect to coping style by exposure to hypoxia. Groups consisting of 24 individually tagged fish, 12 HR and 12 LR were exposed to hypoxia in a two choice system. The system consisted of a ""home"" tank provided with cover connected to a second brightly ""illuminated"" tank via a closable doorway. During the experiment, the doorway between the two tanks was opened and hypoxic conditions were gradually induced in the ""home"" tank by bubbling with nitrogen. The latency time to move away from hypoxic conditions to normoxic conditions in the second tank was recorded for each individual. The oxygen saturation in each tank was measured every 30. min. The experiment consisted of two trials. Each trial was carried out in two sessions, switching the ""home"" tank and ""illuminated"" tank between Sessions 1 and 2. The results indicated that the response to hypoxia differed significantly between LR and HR individuals in both Session 1 (P< 0.05) and Session 2 (P≤ 0.001). Furthermore, a higher number of HR individuals left hypoxic conditions compared to LR individuals in both Session 1 (P = 0.001) and Session 2 (P≤ 0.001). Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate a repeatable difference in behavioural response to hypoxia between the two strains. The method presented could be utilized as a non-invasive method for sorting fish according to stress coping style. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture; Behaviour; Hypoxia; Personalities; Salmonids; Stress response","anoxic conditions; aquaculture; behavioral response; physiological response; salmonid; Aves; Mammalia; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae","Laursen, D.C.; Danish Technical University, Institute of Aquatic Resources, Section for Aquaculture, North Sea Center, P.O.

Associations between personality traits and parasite infections are increasingly being reported, but the extent to which multiple behavioural traits might be associated with parasitism at the same time is largely unknown. Here, we use a population of great tits, Parus major, to examine whether infection by avian malaria (Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon) is associated with three behavioural traits assayed under standardized conditions. All of these traits are of broad ecological significance and two of them are repeatable or heritable in our population. Here, we show weak correlations between some but not all of these behavioural traits, and sex-dependent associations between all three behavioural traits and parasite infection. Infected males showed increased problem-solving performance whereas infected females showed reduced performance; furthermore, uninfected females were four times more likely to solve problems than uninfected males. Infected females were more exploratory than uninfected females, but infection had no effect on males. Finally, infected males were more risk-averse than uninfected males but females were unaffected. Our results demonstrate the potential for complex interactions between consistent personality variation and parasite infection, though we discuss the difficulty of attributing causality in these associations. Accounting for complex parasite-behaviour associations may prove essential in understanding the evolutionary ecology of behavioural variation and the dynamics of host-parasite interactions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Exploratory behaviour; Leucocytozoon; Malaria; Plasmodium; Problem-solving performance; Risk-taking behaviour","avian influenza; correlation; heritability; host-parasite interaction; malaria; parasite; parasite infestation; parasitism; passerine; population structure; sexual behavior; standardization; Aves; Leucocytozoon; Parus major","Quinn, J.

In contrast to human personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social conditions, we reared individuals on either high- or low-food levels in combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult. Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male. Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects of the early environment. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Behavioural type; Bluefin killifish; Dominance; Female choice; Food level; Lucania goodei; Personality; Sexual selection; Social environment","aggression; cyprinid; dominance; growth rate; mate choice; morphology; mortality; physiology; sexual selection; survival; Animalia; Cyprinodontiformes; Lucania goodei","McGhee, K.E.; Integrative Biology, University of Illinois, 433 Morrill Hall 505 S.

Hatchery- and wild-reared brown trout were trained in two different foraging tasks: locating food hidden in a maze and finding a cryptic prey, and their performance within and across tasks was compared. Fish reduced their search time for cryptic prey, but not maze search time, by learning. In contrast to most previous studies hatchery-reared trout generally tended to be more successful feeders and showed faster learning than wild trout when foraging on cryptic prey. This appeared to be due to motivational effects rather than based on cognitive skills. In addition, we examine whether exploration behaviour in brown trout is repeatable across time and context (i.e. reflecting a behavioural syndrome). Individual exploration tendency was repeatable within tasks, suggesting the occurrence of personality in brown trout. However, individuals that were fast explorers in the cryptic prey task were not necessarily fast to explore the maze. Thus, a context-specific behavioural syndrome was found to best explain exploratory behaviour for both hatchery and wild trout. However, repeatability of exploration behaviour within tasks differed between hatchery and wild trout, where wild trout were found to be more consistent in their exploration strategy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Brown trout; Context; Exploration; Hatchery; Learning; Personality","behavioral response; cognition; comparative study; foraging behavior; hatchery; learning; rearing; salmonid; wild population; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae","Adriaenssens, B.; Department of Zoology, Animal Ecology, University of Gothenburg, Box 463, SE-405 30 Göteborg, Sweden; email: bart.adriaenssens@zool.gu.se",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between males as well as greater variation between trials for individual females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and females. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alternative mating strategy; Dipodomys; Food hoarding; Individual variation; Kangaroo rat; Personality; Regression discontinuity design; Sexual dimorphism; Temperament","aggression; behavioral response; body size; caching; interspecific variation; laboratory method; life history trait; mating behavior; rodent; sex-related difference; sexual dimorphism; Animalia; Dipodomys; Dipodomys merriami; Dipodomys ordii; Rattus","Jenkins, S.H.; Department of Biology/0314, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, United States; email: jenkins@unr.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Consistent individual differences in these behaviours (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and 'slow' exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the season. Contrary to our expectations, 'slow' explorers had consistently higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than 'fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels. Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms and the phenotypic traits. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Behavioural syndrome; Great tit; Parus major; Phytohaemagglutinin; Testosterone","aggression; behavioral ecology; hormone; immune response; natural selection; passerine; phenotype; physiological response; plasma; pleiotropy; rodent; selection; Aves; Parus major; Rodentia","van Oers, K.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), P.O.

In addition, we examined if armament, i.e. relative chelae size, would be correlated with individual differences in behaviour. Individuals showed repeatable behaviours across time and context. Individuals that occupied the shelter in competitive dyadic tests also spent more time in the shelter during individual control observations, suggesting that boldness is a personality trait that does not necessarily relate positively to high resource holding potential in the noble crayfish.

It is useful to determine whether there is consistency in FS in dairy cattle, and assess the relationship between FS and other subjective measures of responsiveness in dairy cattle. The aims of this study were to: (a) evaluate the repeatability of the FS and crush score (CS) test in dairy cattle by repeated measurements and (b) examine the correlation of FS and CS with reactivity responses in a human approach test (HAT). FS and CS measurements for 55 Holstein-Friesian heifers were conducted three times at 4-week intervals. Flight response to a HAT was assessed in the passageway of the home-pen on a subset of 33 animals. On completion of the HAT, an assessment of six qualitative terms (at ease, friendly, bold, docile, shy, fearful and nervous) were assessed on a visual analogue scale according to a subjective judgement of whether a cow scored low or high for each term. Correlations between the three monthly repetitions of FS measurements were all significant and positive (FS1,2: rs=0.36, P=0.007; FS2,3: rs=0.31, P=0.002; FS1,3: rs=0.47, P&lt;0.001) which indicates a level of individual consistency. No significant correlations between the three monthly repetitions of CS measurements were found. The mean FS was correlated with HAT flight response (rs=0.42, P=0.004). However, no significant correlations existed between the HAT and the CS.

Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance. Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2, 7, and 14d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack, ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of predation risk and mate attraction. © 2011 Arizona St. University.",,"abundance; adaptive radiation; aggression; behavioral ecology; error analysis; food; foraging behavior; habitat type; mate attraction; predation risk; spatiotemporal analysis; spider; urban area; Arizona; Phoenix; United States; Animalia; Araneae; Latrodectus; Latrodectus hesperus","Chadwick Johnson, J.; Division of Mathematical and Natural Sciences (2352), Arizona State University West, 4701W.

However, there is still a scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family) on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family. It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in more natural circumstances. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,"behavioral ecology; evolutionarily stable strategy; group size; life history trait; rodent; sex ratio; trade-off; Animalia; Microtus arvalis; Muridae; Rodentia","Lantová, P.; Centre of Excellence in Evolutionary Research, Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Jyväskylä, PO Box 35, Jyväskylä, FI 40014, Finland; email: petra.lantova@jyu.fi",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650828368

A prototype method required magnetic switches on the weighing crate to record gate positioning and enclosure of the animal, with data analysis subsequent to the completion of weighing. The method reported here does not require additional equipment, instead using a computer program to analyse weights in real-time to record the degree of sheep movement. The result is summarised as the coefficient of variation of the weight over a period of 8-20. s and reported as an activity score. The real-time method had a higher repeatability (P<0.05) than the prototype method and gave a stronger association with liveweight with heavier lambs and heavier young sheep being less active under confinement at 6 months and 18 months, respectively (P<0.05). These findings indicate that a simple system could be developed enabling real-time reporting of activity scores during normal weighing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Activity; Sheep; Temperament; Weighing","activity pattern; algorithm; behavioral response; body mass; data acquisition; movement; real time; sheep; temperature effect; Animalia; Ovis aries","Horton, B.J.; Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research, University of Tasmania, PO Box 46, Kings Meadows, Tasmania 7249, Australia; email: Brian.Horton@utas.edu.au",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

The costs and benefits of these responses vary among individuals causing them to differ even in identical situations. One example of this type of situation is when territorial males encounter both a male and female simultaneously, generating a trade-off that likely leads to individual differences due to differing costs of various actions among males. This situation commonly occurs in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. However, for selection to act effectively, individuals must behave in a consistent manner and measuring repeatability can aid in understanding how selection may shape such trade-offs. Males of this species exhibit consistent individual differences in their response to dummy males and females but it is unknown if patterns are similar when feedback from the stimuli is present. To assess this, male threespine stickleback were tested with dummy and live male and female conspecifics, presented separately and simultaneously. While the same trends were found regardless of stimulus type, males were more aggressive towards the live conspecifics than to the dummies. Repeatability values were similar within a treatment regardless of whether live or dummy conspecifics were used, suggesting that individuals show the same level of consistency. This study adds to our understanding of consistent individual differences by demonstrating that feedback may not affect responses to conflicting stimuli and that male threespine stickleback respond in a consistent manner to both dummy and live stimuli. © 2011 Current Zoology.","Behavioural consistency; Decision-making; Repeatability; Stimulus efficacy; Threespine stickleback","Gasterosteus; Gasterosteus aculeatus","Dzieweczynski, T.

In order to understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment. Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects had little influence on these components of reproductive success. However, we found that the social environment (manipulated operational sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive strategies.© The Author 2010.","Behavioral syndromes; Extrapair paternity; Fitness landscapes; Mating preferences; Operational sex ratio; Reproductive success; Sexual selection; Temperament","behavioral response; captive population; fitness; genetic analysis; genetic variation; heritability; mating behavior; passerine; paternity; quantitative analysis; reproductive success; sex ratio; sexual selection; trade-off; Taeniopygia guttata","Schielzeth, H.; Department of Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Norbyvägen 18D, SE-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden; email: holger.schielzeth@ebc.uu.se",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

In addition, we assessed to what extent personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome. Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing within-group hierarchies.

It is a stable and heritable trait, which is expressed consistently in different situations. The aim of our study was to develop novel tests to depict the personality structure of the bank vole Myodes glareolus, and to determine if the phase of the population cycle, i. e. population density, affects personality. We focused on some central aspects of bank vole behaviour: mobility, risk taking, exploratory behaviour, dominance, and aggressive behaviour towards pups. These behaviours were chosen because they directly affect bank vole survival or fitness or are classified as important factors of personality in other species. In total, 192 males from different populations went through four behavioural tests, in which 20 variables were measured. The tests were repeated after 3 weeks, which verified that all traits were stable, i. e. repeatable between trials. Three personality compounds emerged, named extroversion, novelty seeking and infanticide. Extroversion included dominance and mobility, while novelty seeking consisted of risk taking and exploration. Infanticide encompassed all indices measuring harmful behaviour towards pups. Mobility and dominance were connected, possibly because both seem to depend on condition. Time spent in captivity increased extroversion, which may be explained by good food, stable conditions and acclimation to strong social cues. Novelty seeking was connected to repeatability which could mean that novelty avoiding individuals adjust their behaviour to match new environments. Population density affected the infanticide trait but not novelty seeking or extroversion. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Dominance; Infanticide; Myodes (Clethrionomys); Novelty seeking; Personality","acclimation; aggression; dominance; fitness; heritability; mobility; population density; population structure; rodent; survival; aggression; animal; animal behavior; article; Arvicolinae; exploratory behavior; physiology; population density; population dynamics; social dominance; Aggression; Animals; Arvicolinae; Behavior, Animal; Exploratory Behavior; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Social Dominance; Clethrionomys; Clethrionomys glareolus; Muridae; Rodentia","Korpela, K.; Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Jyväskylä, P.O.

It indicates that animal behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P. unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality and lifehistory traits that affect fitness. © Inter-Research 2010.","Behaviour; Boldness; Longitudinal; Mixed model; Repeatability; Temperament","activity pattern; aggression; behavioral ecology; fitness; harvesting; individual variation; life history trait; numerical model; perception; percid; sampling bias; vulnerability; Animalia; Parma microlepis; Pomacentridae","Biro, P.

One way used to identify people susceptible to psychosis is through the schizotypal personality trait. Persons with schizotypal characteristics have been identified with the widely used Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief. However, no suitable instruments are available to screen individuals in the Taiwanese population for evidence of early psychotic symptoms. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the sensitivity and specificity of the Chinese version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief for identifying undergraduate students' susceptibility to psychosis. Design: Two-stage, cross-sectional survey design. Setting and participants: The self-administered scale was tested in a convenience sample of 618 undergraduate students at a medical university in Taiwan. Among these students, 54 completed the scale 2 weeks apart for test-retest reliability, and 80 were tested to identify their susceptibility to psychosis. Data collection and analysis: In Stage I, participants with scores in the top 6.5% were classified as the high-score group (n=40). The control group (n=40) was randomly selected from the remaining participants with scores <15 and matched by gender. These 80 students were asked to participate in psychiatric interviews in Stage II. The instrument was tested for reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients and the Kuder-Richardson formula 20. The instrument was analysed for optimal sensitivity and specificity using odds-ratio analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The 22-item Chinese version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief had a 2-week test-retest reliability of 0.82 and internal consistency of 0.76. The optimal cut-off score was 17, with odds ratios of 24.4 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.83. The instrument had a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 85.9% in identifying undergraduate students' susceptibility to psychosis. Conclusions: The Chinese version Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief is a reliable instrument, but should not be used as a screening tool until its psychometric properties have been evaluated in more detail. Other screening tools need to be used in future studies with the CSPQ-B to improve the accuracy of identifying susceptibility to psychosis among young adults. © 2010.","Chinese version Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief; Psychosis; Screen; Sensitivity; Specificity","adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; female; human; male; personality test; psychological aspect; psychosis; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; schizoidism; sensitivity and specificity; student; Taiwan; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Male; Personality Assessment; Psychotic Disorders; Questionnaires; Schizoid Personality Disorder; Sensitivity and Specificity; Students; Taiwan; Young Adult","Ma, W.-F.; School of Nursing and Nursing Department, China Medical University and Hospital, 91, Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung 40402, Taiwan; email: lhdaisy@mail.cmu.edu.tw",,,00207489,,IJNUA,"20580002","English","Int.

We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day basis. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bombus terrestris; Bumblebee; Episodic personality; Neophilia; Neophobia; Repeatability","bee; behavioral response; color; foraging behavior; individual variation; numerical model; social insect; statistical analysis; Animalia; Apoidea; Bombus terrestris; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Vertebrata","Muller, H.; Research Centre for Psychology, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, United Kingdom; email: h.muller@qmul.ac.uk",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

In doing so, we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a) related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c) correlated with behavioral output (e.g. aggressiveness) and productivity (e.g. growth).

Studies generally report consistent individual differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested whether individuals change their activity level differently within a single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5 min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity patterns. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Activity; Exploration; Open-field test; Personality; Rodent","activity pattern; behavioral ecology; field method; individual variation; regression analysis; rodent; temporal variation; testing method; wild population; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus; Rodentia; Tamias striatus","Montiglio, P.-O.; Canada Research Chair in Behavioural Ecology, Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal, case postale 8888, succursale centre-ville, Montréal, Qc H3C 3P8, Canada; email: montiglio.pierre-olivier@courrier.uqam.ca",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Increasing research is revealing the adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability. We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3 measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational patterns of trait repeatability. © The Author 2010.

Recent work has suggested that contrasting predation pressures may lead to population differentiation in personality traits. However, there are indications that these personality traits also differ between sexes and not necessarily in a consistent way between populations. We used an integrative approach to quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities. We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was non-significant in all populations. We discuss what responses to expect from predator-naïve versus predator-experienced individuals and how this can be linked to the shyness-boldness continuum. © 2010 The Authors.",,"body size; cyprinid; evolutionarily stable strategy; life history trait; population size; prey selection; Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia reticulata","Harris, S.; Dept of Biology, Animal Ecology, Lund Univ., SE-223 62 Lund, Sweden; email: Sanna.Harris@zooekol.lu.se",,,00301299,,OIKSA,,"English","Oikos",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958459459

We analysed sleep behaviour in a free-living population of blue tits in southern Germany. We recorded individuals roosting in nestboxes between November and April using infrared-sensitive cameras. We investigated the following sleep parameters: time of entering and leaving the nestbox, sleep onset, awakening time, sleep duration, midpoint of sleep, latency to sleep and frequency and duration of nocturnal awakenings. Sleep onset, awakening time and sleep duration followed seasonal changes in daylength. Blue tits slept ca 4.8 h longer in winter than in spring. During the night, birds woke up between 23 and 230 times, but this did not change seasonally. Local light conditions influenced awakening time: birds at brighter locations woke up earlier. Females slept on average 15 min longer per night than males and this sex difference became more pronounced in early spring. Although females spent a greater proportion of the night awake than males, they still slept more overall. First-year birds spent more time in the nestbox after waking up and left the nestbox later in the morning than older individuals. Repeatability estimates showed that individuals were consistent in their sleep behaviour over the 2-year study period. Our results indicate that sleep patterns are individual-specific traits in blue tits.

Quantifying individual differences often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short- and long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap, respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types, including trap-shy individuals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural syndrome; Cyanocitta stelleri; Exploration; Personality; Repeatability; Risk taking; Steller's jay; Trapping success","alarm signal; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; bioassay; captivity; experimental study; individual variation; life history trait; passerine; sampling bias; trapping; Animalia; Corvidae; Cyanocitta stelleri","Black, J.M.; Department of Wildlife, Humboldt State University, 1 Harpst Street, Arcata, CA 95521, United States; email: jeff.black@humboldt.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

A rarely explored example of this is when both a male and a female are present simultaneously and a male must decide to fight or court. Consistent individual differences have been found in decision-making in Siamese fighting fish; however, dummies were used to explore this question and it is possible that individuals respond differently in this situation when faced with live stimuli as a result of feedback. Therefore, this study investigated whether males behave similarly to dummy and live stimuli by exposing them to male and female conspecifics both simultaneously and separately. Subjects were tested first with dummies and then in the same situations using live conspecifics. It was hypothesized that males would respond in the same manner to both the dummy and live fish. The results indicated that individuals behaved similarly to the dummy fish and the live fish in corresponding conditions. In addition, repeatability levels suggest that individuals behaved similarly across trials of a given treatment type while differing from one another in their responses. This study demonstrates that males are consistent in their responses even when receiving feedback from conspecifics and supports the continued use of dummy stimuli as an effective tool. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Conflicting stimuli; Consistent individual differences; Decision-making; Siamese fighting fish; Stimulus effectiveness","behavioral response; conspecific; decision making; experimental study; perciform; animal behavior; article; feedback system; female; fish; male; nonhuman; stimulus response; Thailand; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Conflict (Psychology); Decision Making; Feedback, Psychological; Female; Individuality; Male; Nesting Behavior; Perciformes; Photic Stimulation; Reproducibility of Results; Macropodinae","Dzieweczynski, T.L.; Department of Psychology, University of New England, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005, United States; email: tdzieweczynski@une.edu",,,03766357,,BPROD,"20600699","English","Behav.

We measured the behavioural type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not included in this behavioural syndrome.

Recent studies have highlighted the relationship between motivation and functional outcome in schizophrenia and identified IM as an important mediating factor between neurocognition and psychosocial outcome. It therefore becomes imperative to have validated measures of IM for empirical use. To that end, we validated a self-report IM scale that gauges the central motivational structures identified by Self-determinism Theory as pertinent to cognitive task engagement, skill acquisition, treatment compliance, and remediation outcome. Participants were schizophrenia outpatients involved in a cognitive remediation study (n=58), a convenience subsample of clinically stable schizophrenia outpatients (n=15), and a group of healthy normals (n=22). The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for Schizophrenia Research (IMI-SR) is a concise instrument, possessing good internal consistency (α=.92) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation=.77). Data were analyzed to abridge the original 54 items into a final 21-item questionnaire comprised of 3 domains relevant to motivation for treatments (interest/enjoyment, perceived choice, value/usefulness). The scale was highly associated with germane constructs of motivation for health-related behaviors, including perceived competency for attempting challenging tasks and autonomous treatment engagement. Importantly, the scale was able to distinguish improvers and nonimprovers on a cognitive task and actual learning exercises, delineate high vs low treatment attendance, and demonstrate sensitivity to motivational changes due to intervention variation. The IMI-SR is a viable instrument to measure IM in schizophrenia as part of a cognitive remediation protocol or psychosocial rehabilitation program. © The Author 2009.","assessment; motivation; rehabilitation; schizophrenia","adult; article; clinical protocol; cognition; competence; correlation analysis; exercise; female; functional assessment; human; instrinsic motivation inventory for schizophrenia research; instrumentation; inventory control; learning; major clinical study; male; medical research; motivation; outcome assessment; outpatient; perception; priority journal; psychometry; rating scale; rehabilitation; schizophrenia; self report; social psychology; task performance; test retest reliability; validation study; Adult; Attention; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Female; Humans; Intelligence; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Neuropsychological Tests; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Psychotic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Research; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Self Efficacy; Social Control, Informal","Choi, J.; Department of Psychiatry, Division of Mental Health Services and Policy Research, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, United States; email: Jc3110@columbia.edu",,,05867614,,SCZBB,"19386577","English","Schizophr.

Contributions to babysitting and provisioning were significantly repeatable and positively correlated within individuals, with provisioning more repeatable than babysitting. While repeatability of provisioning was relatively invariant across categories of individuals, repeatability of babysitting increased with age and was higher for subordinates than dominants.

As part of the Welfare Quality® project this study aimed to identify feasible and reliable resting measures in terms of inter-observer reliability (IOR) and consistency of results per farm over time that can be included in an on-farm welfare assessment protocol. Altogether 15 measures were investigated. They were recorded during three farms visits (approximately 60 and a further 120 days apart) on 35 farms in Austria and Germany with cubicle, deep litter and tie stall systems. Seven measures occurred too infrequently (&lt;1/h and 1% respectively) to allow reliable recording within a limited observation time. IOR was generally acceptable to excellent (Spearman's r=0.7-1.0), except for 'collision during lying down' with a PABAK of 0.2 (n=15, observed on farm). However, after improvement of the definition IOR was good (0.78, n=65, observed from videos). Only three measures were acceptably repeatable over time, 'duration of lying down' (Kendall's W=0.78 for a minimum of 6 recorded occurrences), 'percentage of collisions during lying down' (W=0.95) and 'percentage of cows lying partly or completely outside lying area' (W=0.87). These measures are evaluated as suitable animal based welfare measures regarding resting behaviour in the framework of an on-farm welfare assessment protocol. They can be easily and reliably recorded within 2h during a farm visit require only a short training period and show sufficient consistency of results over time. They, moreover, allow distinction between different housing systems. However their sensitivity with regard to differences between individual farms and within farms over time needs further investigation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Dairy cow housing; On-farm welfare assessment; Reliability; Resting behaviour","animal welfare; cattle; feasibility study; health risk; lesion; regeneration; reliability analysis; Austria; Germany; Animalia; Bos","Plesch, G.; Department of Farm Animal Behaviour and Husbandry, University of Kassel, Nordbahnhofstrasse 1a, 37213 Witzenhausen, Germany; email: plesch@uni-kassel.de",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

Variation in animal temperament is rapidly gaining interest and attention within behavioural and evolutionary ecology. If we are to understand the causes and consequences of temperament variation within and between populations we need to determine the selection pressures that affect temperament in natural environments. To date, however, the vast majority of temperament studies have been carried out on captive-bred individuals. This review highlights potential problems that arise from using captive animals to elucidate the ecological and evolutionary functions of temperament in wild populations. For example, development, learning and environmental variability can all affect behaviour. Thus, both environment and gene-by environment interactions can affect the fitness functions of different temperaments, and hence selection. We stress the need for measurements of repeatability and heritability, and the importance of biological and ecological validation of temperament tests in wild animals. We describe the limited evidence from wild populations of the fitness consequences of temperament variation, and the use of intra- and inter-specific comparisons to prove adaptation. To identify multiple axes of behavioural variation, and how these interact with environments that vary spatially and temporally, we need long-term studies on wild populations - yet few studies of this nature currently exist. Finally, and perhaps counter-intuitively, we suggest that there is much to be gained from incorporating some of the approaches and statistics employed in the much longer established field of human personality. © 2010 The Authors.

Despite this, work on the consequences of hormone profiles has traditionally ignored the large inter-individual variation within natural populations. However, recent research has advocated the need to explicitly consider this variation and address its consequences for selection. One of the key steps in this process is examining repeatability in hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits under selection. In this study we show that individuals within a free-ranging population of the Australian lizard Egernia whitii exhibit temporal repeatability in their circulating baseline testosterone concentrations as well as their aggressive response towards conspecific intruders. Furthermore, we show significant, sex-specific links between testosterone and aggression. Specifically, testosterone and aggression is negatively linked in males, while there is no relationship in females. As conspecific aggression has significant consequences for fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in this species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations, through their effects on aggression, could have important implications for individual fitness. We discuss the potential causes and consequences of hormonal repeatability as well as provide explanations for its sex-specific links with aggression. Specifically, we suggest that these patterns are the result of alternative hormonal pathways governing aggression within Egernia and may indicate a decoupling of aggression and testosterone across the sexes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Animal personalities; Egernia whitii; Hormonal repeatability; Reptile; Sex steroids","testosterone; testosterone; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; controlled study; female; lizard; male; mating; nonhuman; parental behavior; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; sex difference; sexual behavior; testosterone blood level; aggression; aging; animal; blood; periodicity; physiology; principal component analysis; psychologic test; reproducibility; sexual behavior; sexual development; social behavior; time; Aggression; Aging; Animals; Female; Lizards; Male; Periodicity; Principal Component Analysis; Psychological Tests; Radioimmunoassay; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Behavior; Testosterone; Time Factors; Aggression; Aging; Animals; Female; Lizards; Male; Periodicity; Principal Component Analysis; Psychological Tests; Radioimmunoassay; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Behavior; Testosterone; Time Factors","While, G.M.; School of Zoology, University of Tasmania, Private Bag 05, Tasmania, Australia; email: gwhile@utas.edu.au",,,0018506X,,HOBEA,"20361965","English","Horm.

The presentation of conflicting stimuli in the form of a female and a male provides a unique situation that has not been widely explored in terms of consistent individual variation. To assess consistency and plasticity in decision-making, male Siamese fighting fish were presented with a single female, single male and paired male and female presented simultaneously both when they did and did not have nests. Having a nest had a marked effect on male response, but only towards the female. Males differed from one another in the strategies they used when faced with conflicting stimuli; some males focused on the male, others on the female, and still others divided their response between the two. Most importantly, males behaved consistently yet differed from one another when context and reproductive state were constant. Finally, some males exhibited consistent plasticity as a result of social environment and/or reproductive state, the first finding of this kind.

However, there is now evidence from a diverse range of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome? and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail loss, possibly due to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs. © 2010 The Author.","Agama planiceps; Behavioral syndrome; Boldness; Individual variation; Personality","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; environmental conditions; evolutionary theory; feeding behavior; fitness; home range; lizard; predation; signaling; trade-off; Agama; Agama planiceps","Carter, A.

Here we show that, even after controlling for several confounding effects, this behaviour has a strong individual component (repeatability = 0.84-0.92) in a bird species, leaving a small margin for behavioural flexibility. We hypothesize that individuals may distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their individual susceptibility to human disturbance. This habitat selection hypothesis merits further research, given its implications on both evolutionary and applied ecology research. For example, selection of human-tolerant phenotypes may be promoted through the humanization of habitats occurring worldwide, and when population means instead of individual variability in FID are considered for designing buffer zones to reduce human impacts on wildlife. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Disturbance; Disturbance-induced habitat selection hypothesis; Habituation; Personalities; Temperaments","anthropogenic effect; antipredator defense; buffer zone; burrowing; climate variation; disturbance; flight; habitat selection; habituation; human activity; life history trait; phenotype; predator; raptor; trade-off; Athene; Aves; Strigiformes","Carrete, M.; Estación Biológica de Doñana (CSIC), 41092 Sevilla, Spain; email: martina@ebd.csic.es",,"Royal Society",17449561,,,,"English","Biol.

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal personality; behavioural syndrome; blue tit; Cyanistes caeruleus; exploration; neophobia; risk responsiveness","behavioral response; captivity; foraging behavior; passerine; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Cyanistes caeruleus","Herborn, K.A.; Division of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences, University of GlasgowUnited Kingdom; email: k.herborn.1@research.gla.ac.uk",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Three replicates of two strains were established by artificial selection for more than 17 generations: S strains exhibited shorter duration and lower frequency of death feigning while L strains exhibited longer duration and higher frequency of death feigning. Duration of death feigning clearly responded to selection, and significant value of realized heritability was detected in all replicates of the two strains.

Results: The sum of the scores for the items on the examination had good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation [ICC] 0.95) and acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.76). The test-retest study also showed good reliability (ICC 0.91). There were modest associations between the examination and the assessment of motor function made by the physical education teacher (ICC 0.37) as well as from the parents' description (ICC 0.39). The examination of neurological soft-signs had a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.76 in predicting motor problems as evaluated by the physical education teacher.

Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Barnacle goose; Boldness; Branta leucopsis; Foraging strategy; Personality; Producer-scrounger game","activity pattern; behavioral ecology; foraging behavior; producer-scrounger interaction; waterfowl; Animalia; Anser; Branta leucopsis; Thoracica","Kurvers, R.

In particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank, which partially determines mating success in this species. The expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or genetic basis. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; behavioural syndrome; bluefin killifish; dominance hierarchy; Lucania goodei; personality; repeatability; sexual selection; social interactions","aggression; behavioral ecology; courtship; cyprinid; dominance; freshwater ecosystem; male behavior; sexual selection; social organization; Animalia; Cyprinodontiformes; Lucania goodei","McGhee, K.E.; Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, United States; email: kemcghee@illinois.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Many parasites have evolved the ability to modify the behaviour of their present host to increase the chance of transmission to the next host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted: phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly, amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts. Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome framework. © 2010 BRILL.","Animal personality; Behavioural syndrome; Host manipulation; Host-parasite interaction; Repeatability","Amphipoda; Animalia; Coitocaecum parvum; Microphallus (trematode); Paracalliope; Trematoda","Nakagawa, S.; Department of Zoology, University of Otago, P.O.

We studied the effects of yolk androgens on multiple behavioural traits in female and male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally elevating androgen levels (testosterone and androstenedione) in the eggs. The birds were housed in a common-garden environment in captivity until full independence, after which their behaviour was tested. We found that androgen-treated males were more likely than control males to explore a novel environment and showed higher activity in the presence of a novel object. In response to a simulated predator attack, androgen-treated males mainly showed freezing behaviour, while control males showed escape behaviour. Females from the androgen treatment and control group showed no differences in these behaviours. Androgen treatment did not affect neophobia (latency to approach the novel object) or dominance behaviour in either sex. Behaviour in the novel environment and towards a novel object was repeatable, but behaviours in the different experiments were mostly not inter-correlated. These results indicate that yolk androgens have various long-lasting effects on behaviour, especially in males, but that they do not induce a distinct behavioural syndrome. As behaviour is strongly linked with fitness, our results suggest that yolk androgens may play a role in determining fitness, and thus play a potentially adaptive role. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and methods: Sixty-three patients (40 women, 55 relapsing-remitting and 8 secondary progressive, age 42.6 ± 10.1 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale 2.2 ± 1.7) were assessed using the Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences-New Italian version Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery. Results: MS patients were less likely to use positive and problem-focused strategies, whereas avoiding strategies were adopted more frequently. Twenty-three (36.5%) cases were CI. We found no differences in the type of coping between CI and cognitively preserved patients. Scores on the Stroop test (beta = -0.91, p = 0.04) and on the Word List Generation (beta = 1.15, p = 0.04) were associated with poorer coping strategies. Conclusions: Our study suggests that cognitive functioning (in particular on sustained attention and aspects of executive function) must be considered in a comprehensive account of the factors contributing to successful coping in MS patients. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Latency to reach the 5 m line over the three tests was the most repeatable variable (0.54) and was taken as a measure of social motivation against which to assess other measures of sociability shown by the cows in their home-pen. The home-pen measures were the distance of each cow to the two nearest neighbours, location of the cow in the cow shed, and the level of synchrony based on individual behaviour of each focal cow compared with the rest of the herd's behaviour. Cows that had high latencies to reach the 5 m line had fewer recordings with two near neighbours (W1 = 5.31, P = 0.021), were less synchronised with the herd (W1 = 4.82, P = 0.028), were not present at the feedface during peak feeding (W1 = 4.13, P = 0.042) and stood at the periphery of the cow shed (W1 = 4.03, P = 0.045). These results indicate that these measures could be used to assess the sociability of individual dairy cows in on-farm studies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For example, some people are more outgoing, while others are more reserved. Recently, similar variations in behavioural tendencies have been documented in a number of animal species including molluscs, arthropods, fish, lizards, amphibians, birds and mammals (Bell et al. 2009). Such variation in behavioural responses to the same environmental stimuli has been referred to variously as ‘coping style’ (Koolhaas et al. 1999), ‘temperament’ (Réale et al. 2007), ‘behavioural syndrome’ (Sih et al. 2004) or ‘personality’ (Gosling 2001; Dingemanse & Réale 2005). All these terms imply between-individual differences and some degree of individual consistency in behaviour and physiology over time and in different contexts. Individual differences that are related to personality consist of more than one set of correlated characteristics; they can show themselves either as different behaviours or as one type of behaviour expressed in different situations (Groothuis & Carere 2005). In this chapter, we use the term ‘personality traits’ for the behaviours of an individual that are repeatable and correlated across context, and ‘personality’ for a suite of such personality traits. We also use the currently utilised term ‘behavioural syndrome’, which is defined as a suite of correlated behaviours that reflect intra-individual consistency in behaviours across two or more situations (Sih et al. 2004). While personality type is an individual characteristic, the term behavioural syndrome describes a characteristic of a population (Sih et al. 2004). Personality traits are moderately heritable (van Oers et al. 2005a), are often contingent on physiological and neuroendocrine processes (Koolhaas et al. 1999; Carere et al. 2003; Øverli et al. 2007; Kralj-Fišer et al. 2010b), and are relevant to fitness (Dingemanse & Réale 2005; Smith & Blumstein 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139049955; 9780521822701,,,"English","The Soc.

The present study examines archival data from a sample of imprisoned sex offenders (n=20) who obtained relatively high PCL-R total scores (≥25) and were administered this instrument on a second occasion by a different examiner. Intraclass correlations for the total and Factor 2 score were lower than those generally reported in research studies. Of greater concern, Factor 1 scores were only negligibly related to each other (ICC A, 1=.16). Correcting for potential range restriction among these high scoring individuals resulted in total and Factor 2 score measures of agreement that were somewhat more consistent with published research, but Factor 1 continued to display exceedingly poor agreement across examiners.

Numerous external and internal factors can contribute to this variability. In our study, we investigated the systemic variation of yolk testosterone concentrations during the laying cycle of Japanese quail reared in stable environmental and social conditions. Testosterone was analysed in three eggs collected per female at the beginning, top and the end of a reproductive period and the extent of inter- and intra-female differences in yolk deposition of this androgen was quantified. Yolk testosterone concentrations and the yolk testosterone content decreased from the early to the latest stage of reproductive period. Testosterone concentrations in the egg yolk as well as the age-dependent pattern significantly differed among individual females. We found high repeatability of yolk testosterone among 3 eggs of individual females together with high repeatability between 3 stages of the reproductive cycle. Testosterone in the egg yolk correlated positively with eggshell weight. Our results suggest that precocial birds with long laying sequences display higher inter-female differences in yolk testosterone concentrations compared with intra-individual variability. The decreased testosterone deposition with age may influence the development and behaviour of the young hatched at different stages of the female's reproductive cycle. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

What is needed is an user-friendly, fundamental and reproducible diagnostic method to evaluate the essential emotional-functional stress systems in organism, considering the influences of the individual's constitution, condition and conditionings. Based on experimental / practical / clinical research with thousands of voice graphs over the last years, it appeared that special interpretation modes of a new kind of voice-frequency-analysis VFA allow inferences about essential emotional-functional stress parameters (ESP). With the usage of an individual's timbre it is free of any influence of age, culture or gender. The handling is easy, safe, immediate and location-independent, without any sensors or belts attached to a proband. The VFA is based on the models for living open systems with non-linear behaviour and connects the knowledge of chronobiology, functional medicine, physics, acoustics and stress research. The results of many open studies brought off with the VFA revealed that sound and vibration rhythms cover all interfering biological rhythms. It allows to assess the emotional and functional stress parameters ESP: 'autonomous nervous system', 'redox system', 'acid-base-equilibrium', 'anabolic-catabolic- hormone-equilibrium', 'personality profile' (basic/stress behaviour), 'conditioning', 'experience of time and space - speed and distance', 'potentials', 'stress status', 'problem areas of 'columna vertebralis'. Stress thereby is defined as a communicative process of interfering environmental (technical, natural) rhythms and the biological rhythm system (BRS) of organism. In summary, it can be stated, that VFA is a repeatable, emotional-functional diagnostic method for the human organism. VFA enables to control individual emotional and functional reactions of the human organism during an application of specified acoustic/vibration stressors. By means of an impartial controlling and mobilization of repeatedly intended interventions in order to develop an optimal prevention for the organism and to sustain health and manpower, VFA supports the process of optimizing the human-machine-interaction. VFA is an optimal enhancement to conventional morphological and chemical diagnosis and visual biometric methods.",,"Autonomous nervous systems; Biological rhythm; Biometric methods; Chemical diagnosis; Clinical research; Diagnostic methods; Frequency Analysis; Human organisms; Human-machine interaction; Nonlinear behaviours; Problem areas; Redox systems; Stress effects; Stress parameter; Stress system; Acoustics; Biometrics; Diagnosis; Optimization; Redox reactions; Safe handling; Biology","Heinen, A.; Akademie Individuelle Förderung für Gesundheit, Zürnstr. 5/1, D - 88048 Friedrichshafen, Germany; email: dr@arno-heinen.de",,,,9781615677368,,,"English","Int.

Borderline patients showed deficient attention, immediate and delayed memory, and relatively spared visuospatial and language functions compared with controls (effect size range: 0.34-0.99). The neuropsychological deficit was less pronounced in patients with other personality disorders compared with controls (effect size range: 0.18-0.66). However, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with borderline and other personality disorders. The neuropsychological deficit significantly correlated with the impulsivity sector score of the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD).

Here, we examine the underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour in a novel environment' (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a passerine bird, the great tit Parus major. 2.First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only moderately heritable and permanent environment (VPE) effects contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects. 3.We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment, but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no evidence of any selection on EB through survival. 4.Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients - local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any previous equivalent demonstrations. 5.All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration behaviour (EB2, measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate comparison with other studies. EB and EB2 were strongly correlated to one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at the phenotypic level and VPE was undetected in EB 2. Selection on EB2 was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective. 6.Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong VPE effect detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an environmental context. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Environmental heterogeneity; Heritability; Personality; Population density; Selection; Temperament","breeding site; environmental gradient; evolutionary biology; fecundity; genetic analysis; habitat quality; heritability; heterogeneity; individual variation; maximum likelihood analysis; passerine; population density; reproductive success; selection; survival; animal; article; ecosystem; female; genetic selection; genetics; male; phenotype; physiology; population dynamics; sexual development; songbird; temperament; Animals; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Phenotype; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics; Songbirds; Temperament; Animalia; Aves; Parus major; Passeriformes","Quinn, J.

We quantified repeatability of three swimming performances (burst speed during a c-start escape response, critical swimming speed [Ucrit], maximum speed [Umax]) and size/shape measures over short (within-day), medium (days and weeks), and long (more than a year) time-scales in a small poeciliid fish, the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). 2 We found that individual differences in most swimming performance metrics were repeatable on various time-scales. Burst speed during c-start was repeatable within a day, as well as over days and weeks, but it was not repeatable over the span of a year. However, the medium term repeatability was only statistically significant when accounting for the variation of individuals within a day and correcting for attenuation. Ucrit,Umax and size were repeatable on medium time-scales, but only size and U maxwere repeatable over the span of a year. Our index of shape was not statistically repeatable over any time-scales. 3 When examining the correlations of performances and size, only a few traits were related to each other. Ucrit and Umax were significantly positively related to each other for trial 1 only, but not any of the others. U max and the mean c-start burst speed were correlated on trial 2 only. No other traits were significantly related to each other, and no performance traits were related to size or shape. Ucrit and Umax also did not differ in their overall mean values, suggesting that Umax, a more recently described assessment of fish swimming performance, may be a reliable alternative. 4 All traits, except our index of shape, shifted in their mean value over the span of a year. Ucrit and c-start burst speed decreased significantly, consistent with previous findings on the effects of senescence on neuromuscular systems. However, Umax and size increased significantly over a year. 5 The measures of swimming performance used in this study are becoming widely used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Our results suggest that individual differences in these measures are relatively stable on various time-scales. We found no significant relation of these performance metrics with body size or a simple index of shape, and few relations among the performance measures, suggesting that they measure different aspects of locomotor physiology and/or motivation under the test conditions used. Finally, while Ucrit and c-start burst speed decreased over the span of the year, consistent with theories of senescence, Umax significantly increased over a year, suggesting that further studies of this recently described performance metric are needed. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","C-start; Critical swimming speed; Individual variation; Locomotion; Performance; Poecilia reticulata; Repeatability; Swimming","cyprinid; escape behavior; individual variation; performance assessment; senescence; swimming; Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia reticulata; Poeciliidae","Oufiero, C.

Few short and simple assessment instruments are available in French. Recently, the Questionnaire de Fonctionnement Social (QFS) was developed to study social behavior of psychiatric patients. The QFS is a 16-item self-report questionnaire assessing the frequency of and the satisfaction with social behavior during the last two weeks. The aim of the present study is to explore QFS psychometric properties in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorder. Methods: Eighty-six outpatients (78 women and eight men, mean age: 30.5 ± 8.6) with borderline personality disorder and 100 healthy matched control subjects (89 women and 11 men, mean age: 30.2 ± 7.7) completed the QFS. The convergent and divergent validities of the QFS were tested with the following instruments: Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and a visual scale of suffering (EVS). Test-retest reliability of the QFS was calculated in a sub-sample of 28 subjects and its sensitivity to change was measured for 45 patients. Results: Internal consistency of the QFS' global index was satisfying (Cronbach alpha from 0.59 to 0.84). Test-retest reliability of the QFS indexes ranged from 0.77 to 0.79 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Correlations between QFS and SASS demonstrated moderate convergent validity (r > 0.59) whilst associations with others psychological measures (BSI, BDI, BHS, EVS) showed satisfying divergent validity (-0.42 < r < -0.12). Discriminate validity was excellent as the group of healthy control subjects scored significantly higher than the group of patients in all variables (Mann-Whitney all p < 0.001). QFS sensitivity to change after psychotherapeutic treatment was good as shown by the significant change observed in Frequency and Satisfaction index (Wilcoxon respectively p = 0.002 and p < 0.001). Conclusion: The QFS demonstrated satisfying psychometric properties in the studied population. This study confirms it is a valuable tool to assess social functioning of borderline personality disorder patients. © 2008 L'Encéphale, Paris.","Borderline personality disorder; Self-report questionnaire; Social functioning; Validation","adult; article; Beck Depression Inventory; Beck Hopelessness Scale; borderline state; Brief Symptom Inventory; controlled study; female; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; psychologic assessment; psychometry; questionnaire; Questionnaire de Fonctionnement Social; self report; social adaptation; Social Adaptation Self Evaluation Scale; social interaction; test retest reliability; validation study; Adult; Borderline Personality Disorder; Female; Humans; Male; Personal Satisfaction; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Social Adjustment; Social Behavior; Switzerland; Young Adult","Nicastro, R.; Département de psychiatrie, Programme comportements autodommageables et régulation émotionnelle, Hôpitaux universitaires de Genève, 8, rue du 31-Décembre, 1207 Genève, Switzerland; email: rosetta.nicastro@hcuge.ch",,,00137006,,ENCEA,"19853716","French","Encephale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71349086594

The temperament trait of interest was aggressiveness during feeding in dairy cattle. In this study, we focused on whether it is possible to infer a trait of aggressiveness from the measurement of behavioural responses expressed by individual cows during feeding. Aggressive behaviour appears in many contexts but this paper focuses on aggressive behaviour in a competitive situation over a feed resource in housed dairy cattle. It is important that we fully understand within-cow consistency of aggressiveness in different competitive and social situations. To achieve this the following questions were investigated: (1) are cows consistent in how they express aggressive behaviour over time? (2) and across situations at a standard and reduced (competitive) feedface? The aim of this study was to measure the behavioural reactions of housed dairy cattle during feeding in a way that can be practically and easily recorded on commercial farms. Ten primiparous and 30 multiparous healthy lactating cows were housed in a group (parity = 3.5 ± 2.15; mean ± S.D.). The behaviour of the aggressor and recipient was recorded for each aggressive interaction for 60 min after feed arrival. Repeatability estimates and Kendall's coefficient of concordance were both used to assess consistency of aggressor and recipient behaviours across time. The within-cow repeatability was highest for 'aggressive index' (r = 0.31) and lowest for non-response behaviours (r = 0.04) across time. Individual's responses to the standard and reduced feedface were significantly correlated for contact and non-contact behaviours. These results highlight the complexity of aggressive style of cows during feeding and illustrate that some measures of aggressive feeding behaviour are repeatable within cows. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting at Cape Bird on Ross Island in Antarctica were sampled on three occasions. Penguins with relatively low or high corticosterone responses on the first occasion had consistently low or high responses, as previously found for great tits and chickens. A model for birds is proposed in which birds with low corticosterone responses and proactive personalities are likely to be more successful (have greater fitness) in constant or predictable conditions, whilst birds with reactive personalities and high corticosterone responses will be more successful in changing or unpredictable conditions. There is thus no linear relationship between the size of a corticosterone response and fitness. Whilst the absolute magnitude of corticosterone responses varies markedly across species of birds, coefficients of variation are similar. Individual corticosterone responses are generally repeatable, with significant statistical repeatabilities for 30 min corticosterone concentrations and integrated corticosterone concentrations in the Adelie penguin, great tit and chicken. Coefficients of variation in corticosterone responses between birds and power analyses were used to provide a rule of thumb for determining differences between groups of birds in mean corticosterone concentrations to enable statistical analyses to have acceptable levels of statistical power for given sample sizes. It is suggested that power analyses and this rule of thumb be adopted in future investigations of corticosterone responses in birds. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.

Methods: We measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) during a letter version of the verbal fluency task using near-infrared spectroscopy imaging in twenty healthy adults over two sessions approximately two months apart. Additionally, the mental-health status of the subjects in each session was evaluated according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the Profile of Mood States, and the revised edition of the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory. The association between those scores and [oxy-Hb] changes during the verbal fluency task in each session was investigated. Results: Performance on the verbal fluency task was about equal across the two sessions, and frontal activation during the task was observed globally in approximately the same region. In the test-retest reliability, acceptable values were shown in both the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of the mean [oxy-Hb] changes and the correlation coefficients of the whole waveforms for each subject in the two sessions. Mental-health status as measured by several questionnaires was within the healthy range, and no correlation with the frontal activation was seen, except in several channels. Conclusion: The current results suggest that the measurement experience exerted very little influence, except for in a very small region. In addition, the intrasubject reproducibility of frontal activation measured by multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy was well demonstrated in mentally healthy subjects at intervals of two months. © 2009 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology.","Near-infrared spectroscopy; Prefrontal cortex; Reproducibility; Test-retest reliability; Verbal fluency task","hemoglobin; adult; article; female; frontal cortex; hemoglobin determination; human; human experiment; infrared spectroscopy; male; mental health; normal human; personality test; Profile of Mood States; psychologic assessment; questionnaire; reproducibility; self concept; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; task performance; test retest reliability; verbal behavior; waveform; Adult; Female; Frontal Lobe; Health Status; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxyhemoglobins; Personality Inventory; Prefrontal Cortex; Questionnaires; Regional Blood Flow; Reproducibility of Results; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","Nishimura, Y.; Department of Psychiatry, Division of Neuroscience, Mie University, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; email: ynishimu@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp",,,13231316,,PCNEF,"19496994","English","Psychiatry Clin.

Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species. Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings, behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic plasticity in wild populations.","Behavioral plasticity; Behavioral syndromes; Coping styles; Fair Isle; Routine formation; Temperament","behavioral ecology; environmental change; environmental cue; fitness; life history trait; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; Animalia; Sturnidae; Sturnus vulgaris","Minderman, J.; School of Biology and Psychology, Ridley Building, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, United Kingdom; email: Jeroen.Minderman@newcastle.ac.uk",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Behavioral syndromes involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice, and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction. Our analyses also revealed a ""fast-slow"" syndrome, linking behavior in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context. Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call ""libido."" Libido was defined by a positive relationship between courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context. Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context, may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior in this population.","Animal personalities; Behavioral spillover; False discovery rate; Homosexual behavior in animals; Order effects; Pseudofemale behavior","aggression; cockroach; courtship; homosexuality; intraspecific competition; mate choice; reproductive success; sexual selection; Animalia; Blattaria; Gromphadorhina portentosa","Logue, D.

So-called behavioral syndromes, or consistent patterns of behavior across environments, contradict this assumption of unlimited plasticity. We studied nest defense aggressiveness of female Ural owls (244 females with 482 breeding attempts) breeding in a highly variable environment created by fluctuations in the abundance of their main prey (field and bank voles) across years. Ural owls were more aggressive when voles were increasing in density as well as when the Ural owls had large brood sizes and laid early in the season. Aggressive nest defense was highly repeatable between breeding attempts (r = 0.52 ± 0.05 standard error), but individuals also differed in their plasticity (the extent to which they adjusted the level of their aggression to the varying food conditions). Fierce nest defenders produced more recruits to the local breeding population, but a female's survival was not affected by her intensity of nest defense. A path analysis revealed that nest defense aggressiveness, rather than its correlates vole abundance, brood size, or laying date, best explained offspring recruitment. Our findings provide an ultimate explanation for the Ural owl's extremely aggressive nest defense.","Natural selection; Nest defense; Personality; Strix uralensis; Survival; Temperament; Vole cycle","aggression; brood size; female behavior; laying date; nest guarding; prey availability; raptor; recruitment (population dynamics); rodent; survival; Animalia; Clethrionomys glareolus; Muridae; Strigiformes; Strix uralensis","Kontiainen, P.; Bird Ecology Unit, Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Viikinkaari 1, 00014 Helsinki, Finland; email: pekka.kontiainen@helsinki.fi",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Whilst many studies have investigated how morphological traits such as size affect social structure of populations, comparatively little is known about the influence of behaviours such as boldness and shyness. Using information on social interactions in a wild population of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we construct a social network. For each individual in the network, we quantify its behavioural phenotype using two measures of boldness, predator inspection tendency, a repeatable and reliably measured behaviour well studied in the context of co-operation, and shoaling tendency. We observe striking heterogeneity in contact patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly influenced by behavioural trait. We assert that such structure will have implications for the outcome of selection on behavioural traits and we speculate that the observed positive assortment may act as an amplifier of selection contributing to the maintenance of co-operation during predator inspection. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","Behavioural phenotype; Co-operation; Evolutionary graph theory; Guppy; Personality; Poecilia reticulata; Predator inspection","behavioral response; evolutionary biology; heterogeneity; phenotype; population size; predator control; social network; social structure; teleost; wild population; Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia reticulata","Croft, D.

Methods: A total of 611 patients aged 11-18 years (mean age 13.0, SD 1.6) were assessed using the CBCL, the TRF and the YSR. Results: Intraclass coefficients (ICC) showed low to moderate agreement among informants. Furthermore, the level of agreement was generally less among patients suffering from internalizing disorders than for young patients who displayed externalizing disorders. Logistic regression revealed that the TRF internalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL internalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of internalizing disorders in youth. The YSR internalizing syndrome scale, on the other hand, was not a relevant factor among adolescents of a clinical target population. Likewise, only the TRF externalizing syndrome scale, the CBCL externalizing syndrome scale and gender were relevant prognostic factors for the occurrence of externalizing disorders in youth.

Previous studies have shown that eye white (EW) can be a predictor of a multitude of emotions across different situations, but there is little research on the relationship between EW and temperament. The objective of this experiment was to assess the accuracy and reliability of using the percentage of exposed EW as a predictor of temperament in beef cattle. Forty-eight heifers (group 1), 39 bulls (group 2), and 60 steers (group 3) were video-recorded while in a squeeze chute, and 2 still digital images from each animal were selected for EW determination. Chute temperament scores were assigned: 1 (calm) to 5 (agitated). Flight speeds were measured blindly and independently during a subsequent test in which the amount of time it took a solitary animal to pass a handler and travel a specified distance was recorded. The EW area in each image was measured using Sigmascan Pro 5 and was expressed as the percentage of exposed eye area. Each image was analyzed twice to determine tracing repeatability. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among 2 images of the same animal, as well as among duplicate readings of the same image to determine animal and tracing repeatabilities. The mean percentages of EW were 30.14 +/- 14.37, 31.43 +/- 14.77, and 28.57 +/- 12.38, and the average percentage accuracy for duplicate image EW measures was 96, 96, and 93 (P < 0.0001) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for EW percentage and chute temperament scores were 0.674 (P < 0.0001), 0.95 (P < 0.0001), and 0.696 (P < 0.0001), whereas the correlations between EW and flight speeds were 0.415 (P < 0.0001), 0.333 (P < 0.05), and 0.294 (P < 0.01) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch, we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration) between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts, the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion, the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and of considering the influence of social context in animal personality studies.

Personality is defined as consistency in an individual's behavioral responses over time and/or across situations. One personality trait that has potentially far-reaching implications for behavioral ecology, and may provide insight into the mechanisms by which consistent behavioral correlations arise, is that of boldness. Boldness is defined as the tendency of an individual to take risks and be exploratory in novel contexts. Using the framework of behavioral syndromes, we tested for individual differences in boldness in the laboratory among field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) within and across the contexts of exploratory behavior, activity, and risk taking (e.g., antipredator) behavior. After such testing, individuals were tagged and returned to their lake of origin as part of a mark-recapture study testing for the repeatability of individual differences in boldness. Here, we report strong and consistent individual differences in boldness within and across all 3 behavioral contexts. Additionally, we observed that at least some boldness behaviors were repeatable after a 1-3 month recapture period. This study provides novel evidence for a boldness syndrome in sunfish, as well as insight into how behavioral types (e.g., shy/bold) may evolve and be maintained in natural populations.","Activity; Boldness; Exploration; Personality; Risk taking; Temperament","activity pattern; behavioral response; individual variation; juvenile; laboratory method; mark-recapture method; perciform; tagging; Animalia; Lepomis macrochirus","Wilson, A.

Recent research now suggests that an individual's behaviour, once considered to be plastic, may be more predictable than previously thought. Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours.

In this study, we focused on temperament tests in group-housed finishing pigs, with the objective of validating measures that are readily applicable in commercial settings and potentially related to individual differences in stress response. A total of 118 pigs in two replicate studies were housed in pens of 7-8 pigs per pen. At 24 weeks of age, animals were subjected to three tests of fear in the home pen: the human approach test (HAT), novel object test (NOT) and open door test (ODT). In each test, pigs were scored on their latency to contact the human or object, or to leave the home pen. Tests were repeated on three occasions at intervals of 3-4 days. On each test day the HAT was performed twice to compare results between different handlers. Behaviour in tests of fear was compared with two social tests in a subset of 58 pigs. Lesion scoring was performed after mixing as a measure of aggression, and a feed competition test was used to assess social status. Repeatability within-test was evaluated in a mixed model with pig as a random effect, and agreement between days, handlers and tests was evaluated by partial correlations after controlling for replicate, pen and day effects. Latency to perform all three fear tests decreased significantly over time. Correlations within-test showed significant agreement between all days for HAT and ODT, and between HAT handlers. Between tests, the HAT and ODT were correlated, and ODT and NOT tended to correlate. Comparisons between group fear tests and social tests showed that pigs which readily approach a human tended to have higher lesion scores and fewer feeding bouts in the feed competition trial. While test latencies decrease with repetition, the HAT and ODT show individual consistency over time, which suggests that these tests describe behavioural tendencies and may be useful for predicting fearful responses at slaughter. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The response of dispersal towards evolution largely depends on its heritability for which upper limits are determined by the trait's repeatability. 2. In the Linyphiid spider E. atra, we were able to separate long- and short-distance dispersal behaviours (respectively ballooning and rappelling) under laboratory conditions. By performing repeated behavioural trials for females, we show that average dispersal trait values decrease with increasing testing days. By comparing mated and unmated individuals during two periods (before and after mating for the mated group, and the same two periods for the unmated group), we show that mating has no effect on the mean displayed dispersal behaviour or its within-individual variation. Repeatabilities were high and consistent for ballooning motivation, but not for rappelling. 3. Ballooning motivation can be regarded as highly individual-specific behaviour, while general pre-dispersal and rappelling behaviours showed more individual variation. Such difference in repeatability between long- and short-distance dispersal suggests that short- and long-distance dispersal events are triggered by different ecological and evolutionary mechanisms. © 2008 The Authors.","Consistency; Erigone atra; Evolution; Silk","dispersal; evolutionary biology; heritability; individual variation; life history trait; long range transport; spider; Araneae; Erigone atra; Linyphiidae","Bonte, D.; Department of Biology, Terrestrial Ecology Unit, Ghent University, K.L.

Field studies looking at the relationship between personality and survival value early in life are greatly hampered by the fact that personality can at present only be assessed after individuals become independent from their parents. In passerines, for example, this is often after a period of intensive selection for the survival on fledglings. The main aim of this study is therefore to develop a method to measure personality before this period of selection. For this purpose, we developed the handling stress (HS) test. We measured HS in 14-d-old great tit nestlings by counting the number of breast movements (breath rate) in four subsequent 15-s bouts for 1 min; before and after they were socially isolated from their siblings for 15 min. To calculate the repeatability of HS, we repeated the test 6 mo later. To assess the relationship between HS and exploratory behaviour, we correlated the outcome of both tests. We ran tests both on birds of lines selected for extreme personality and on wild birds from a natural population. We found that birds selected for fast exploration reacted more to HS compared with birds selected for slow exploration and that HS was repeatable in different life phases. We confirmed this by finding an increase in the HS with increasing exploratory scores in wild birds. These results show that we can use the HS test as a measurement of personality, making it a potential tool for studying the relationship between personality and survival value early in life. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag.",,"behavioral response; experimental study; fledging; handling stress; nestling; passerine; survival; Aves; Parus major","Fucikova, E.; Department of Animal Population Biology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), PO Box 40, 6666 ZG, Heteren, Netherlands; email: e.fucikova@nioo.knaw.nl",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62749113427

By definition, trait anxiety does not vary from moment to moment, therefore any model used to evaluate it needs to give the same results in sequential trials. With this in mind, the test-retest reliability of the free-exploratory paradigm in rats was evaluated. The behaviour of drug-naive, adult, male, Wistar rats was measured in the free-exploratory apparatus on two occasions, either one week apart (Experiment I) or four weeks apart (Experiment II). The following parameters were evaluated: percentage of time spent in the novel compartment of the free exploratory box; percentage of novel compartment units visited; percentage of time rearing in the novel compartment; and attempts to enter the novel compartment. Subsequently, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the kappa index (κ) were calculated for each of these parameters. The ""percentage of time spent in the novel compartment"" was found to be stable over time. Analysis of this parameter in Experiment I showed high values of ICC (0.805) and κ (0.716), indicating good reliability with a one-week inter-trial interval. In Experiment II, although the same parameter's kappa index (0.255) failed to show a reasonable test/retest concordance, the ICC value (0.760) still demonstrated a good test/retest correlation, suggesting that with a four-week inter-trial interval, the reliability may diminish, but still exists. Therefore, our results bring further support to the free-exploratory paradigm as an animal model of trait anxiety. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We also predicted that (4) intensity of defense would increase with age and number of young, but decline over the breeding season. Intensity of nest defense was significantly repeatable for male kingbirds. Male response was twice as strong as female response during incubation and the nestling period, but nest success was independent of defense scores of males and females. Simple paired comparisons suggested female responses did not change between incubation and the nestling period, whereas males tended to defend nestlings more vigorously than eggs. Multivariate analyses demonstrated strong individual differences were the main source of variation in nest defense. Intensity of nest defense by males and females increased with age of young, declined seasonally, but was not related to number of young. Kingbird nest defense is a repeatable behavior that differs between males and females and, as predicted by parental investment theory, nests of the greatest value (older young and earlier broods) were defended most aggressively.",,"age-related difference; comparative study; fitness; hypothesis testing; incubation; life history theory; multivariate analysis; nest guarding; nest predation; nesting success; nestling; parental investment; passerine; sex-related difference; survival; Malheur National Wildlife Refuge; North America; Oregon; United States; Tyrannus; Tyrannus tyrannus","Redmond, L.J.; Department of Biology, Portland State University, P.

Thirty-six percent of the OIS in this sample were found to be SBC with high interrater agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93) for category classification. SBC cases were more likely to result in the death or injury of the subjects than regular OIS cases. Most SBC cases were spontaneous, but had clear verbal and behavioral indicators that occurred prior to, and during the event. Findings confirm the trend detected in earlier research that there was a growing incidence of SBC among OIS. SBC individuals had a high likelihood of possessing a weapon (80%), which was a firearm 60% of the time. Half of those with a firearm discharged it at the police during the encounter. Nineteen percent simulated weapon possession to accomplish their suicidal intent.

Consequently, it has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from the social environment will provide a major source of heritable variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rAO,F) effects were high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rAO,F will cause the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss important components of heritable variation, and show that a full understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration of the genetic component of the social environment. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Aggression; Indirect genetic effect; Peromyscus maniculatus","aggression; evolution; genetics; modeling; rodent; vertebrate; aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; covariance; evolution; genetic variability; genotype; heredity; mouse; nonhuman; Peromyscus; phenotype; priority journal; quantitative analysis; social environment; vertebrate; Peromyscus; Peromyscus maniculatus; Vertebrata","Wilson, A.

Thirty-six lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were each subjected to three human approach tests and three novel stimuli tests. Flight response score was assessed by an experimenter approaching cows when they were in the passageway of the home-pen (AP), lying down (AL) and at the feedface (FF). Each human approach test was repeated on each cow three times. The intra-animal repeatability estimates were 0.65, 0.40, 0.27 for AP, AL and FF tests, respectively. Repeatability evaluates an individual's consistency across tests by comparing it to the variation within the group. Cows showed moderate consistency in their flight response scores to the different approach tests (W35 = 0.56, P &lt; 0.01). Three novel stimuli (water spray, striped boards and flashing light) were individually presented once to each cow. Investigatory and reactivity behavioural responses were assessed. Cows showed the greatest reactivity response to the water spray compared to the striped boards (U1 = 56, P &lt; 0.001) and flashing light (U1 = 66, P &lt; 0.001). No statistically significant agreement existed between the novel stimuli reactivity and investigatory responses with the AP flight response scores. In conclusion, consistency over time was demonstrated over a relatively short period for the AP test and consistency between human approach situations was shown, however, consistency between human and novel situations was not found. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Sperm morphology can be highly variable among species, but less is known about patterns of population differentiation within species. Most studies of sperm morphometric variation are done in species with internal fertilization, where sexual selection can be mediated by complex mating behavior and the environment of the female reproductive tract. Far less is known about patterns of sperm evolution in broadcast spawners, where reproductive dynamics are largely carried out at the gametic level. We investigated variation in sperm morphology of a broadcast spawner, the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), within and among spawnings of an individual, among individuals within a population, and among populations. We also examined population-level variation between two reproductive seasons for one population. We then compared among-population quantitative genetic divergence (QST) for sperm characters to divergence at neutral microsatellite markers (FST). Results. All sperm traits except total length showed strong patterns of high diversity among populations, as did overall sperm morphology quantified using multivariate analysis. We also found significant differences in almost all traits among individuals in all populations. Head length, axoneme length, and total length had high within-male repeatability across multiple spawnings. Only sperm head width had significant within-population variation across two reproductive seasons. We found signatures of directional selection on head length and head width, with strong selection possibly acting on head length between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the QST-FST comparison. Conclusion. Sperm morphology in S. droebachiensis is highly variable, both among populations and among individuals within populations, and has low variation within an individual across multiple spawnings. Selective pressures acting among populations may differ from those acting within, with directional selection implicated in driving divergence among populations and balancing selection as a possible mechanism for producing variability among males. Sexual selection in broadcast spawners may be mediated by different processes from those acting on internal fertilizers. Selective divergence in sperm head length among populations is associated with ecological differences among populations that may play a large role in mediating sexual selection in this broadcast spawner. © 2008 Manier and Palumbi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; axoneme; comparative study; genetic variability; male; microsatellite marker; morphological trait; nonhuman; population genetics; quantitative genetics; sea urchin; spawning; spermatozoon; animal; classification; cytology; genetic selection; histology; species difference; Strongylocentrotus; Echinoidea; Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis; Animals; Male; Selection (Genetics); Species Specificity; Sperm Head; Spermatozoa; Strongylocentrotus","Manier, M.

These typical reactions, described as 'behavioral syndromes' or 'personalities,' appear to be heritable and therefore subject to selection. We studied behavioral syndromes in 36 male fowl living in 12 social groups and found that individuals behaved consistently over time. Furthermore, responses to different contexts (anti-predator, foraging, and territorial) were inter-correlated, suggesting that males exhibited comparable behavioral traits in these functionally distinct situations. We subsequently isolated the same roosters and conducted tests in a 'virtual environment,' using high-resolution digital video sequences to simulate the anti-predator, foraging, and territorial contexts that they had experienced outdoors. Under these controlled conditions, repeatability persisted but individual responses to the three classes of stimuli failed to predict one another. These were instead context-specific. In particular, production of each type of vocal signal was independent, implying that calls in the repertoire are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Our results show that extrinsic factors, such as social position, can be responsible for the appearance of traits that could readily be mistaken for the product of endogenous characters. © 2008 The Authors.",,"gamebird; signaling; social behavior; vocalization","Nelson, X.

Relevant, quick, and user-friendly assessment scales are needed to facilitate measurement-based treatment of schizophrenia. Methods: The authors created unique convenient assessment scales: Targeted Inventory on Problems in Schizophrenia (TIP-Sz), and Functional Assessment for Comprehensive Treatment of Schizophrenia (FACT-Sz). The TIP-Sz consists of 10 items (behavioral dyscontrol/disorganization, hostility/agitation/violence, indifference/affective withdrawal/motor retardation, symptoms on mood/anxiety/obsession/compulsion, insight/reality testing, social competence/independence, adherence to treatment, therapeutic alliance/comfort of therapists on the situation, overall prognostic impression, and subjective well-being/satisfaction with therapy). They are all common and frequently problematic, and each item is rated from 0-10. The FACT-Sz evaluates psychosocial functioning of patients with a score of 0-100, and is judged entirely on an objective basis. Their correlations with the frequently utilized Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity subscale were determined. Results: Data on 36 patients, assessed separately by four experienced psychiatrists, were analyzed. Under an excellent interrater reliability among raters (Intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.822-0.966), correlations among the scales were very high (Spearman's ρ: 0.825-0.909), and other indicators of the scale were generally good. Specifically, the TIP-Sz and FACT-Sz could be rated at 1/3-1/4 of time to complete the PANSS and GAF. Conclusion: The TIP-Sz and FACT-Sz proved to be reliable and valid, which would be of value in daily clinical practice as a minimum standardized assessment set. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Drosophila has been instrumental in unraveling the neurological basis of olfactory processing in insects [2]. Basic knowledge regarding chemical ecology and thorough studies of olfactory preferences are still lacking to a great extent in D. melanogaster, however. We have characterized repeatable variation in olfactory preference between five classical D. melanogaster wild-type strains toward a large array of natural host odors and synthetic compounds. By recording the rate of attraction over up to 24 hr, we could compare stimuli varying in attractiveness and characterize phenotypic parameters on the basis of individual stimuli and the whole stimulus array. Behavioral differences between strains were predominantly due to variation in a single phenotypic parameter: their overall responsiveness toward optimal and suboptimal olfactory stimuli. These differences were not explained by variation in olfactory sensitivity, locomotory activity, or general vigor monitored by survival. Comparisons with three recently established wild-type strains indicated that a high behavioral threshold against accepting suboptimal olfactory stimuli is the characteristic phenotype of wild D. melanogaster. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Both child and parent coping measures were examined using principal axis factor analysis. Clear 2-factor structures (ie, approach and avoidant-based coping factors) emerged. The children's approach-based coping was negatively related to both dental anxiety and pain perception; their use of avoidant-based coping was also negatively related to dental anxiety. Psychological functioning emerged as a mediating variable between dental anxiety and pain perception.

Methods: The language equivalency and content validity of the Chinese version of the CDS (C-CDS) were evaluated. Measurement performance was tested on 200 Chinese cardiac patients and repeated on 40 patients for test-retest reliability. Results: One item pertaining to sexual activity was removed from the Chinese version due to poor cultural relevance. The C-CDS demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α of .91 for the total scale and .53-.78 for the subscales). The high correlation (r=.64-.89) between items and the remainder of their own scale provides further evidence of internal consistency. The test-retest reliability was satisfactory with intraclass correlation coefficients of .94 for the overall scale and .73-.92 for the six subscales. The total and subscale scores that were not significantly different (P>.05) over a 2-week period further support the stability of the instrument. There was acceptable concurrent validity with moderate (r≥.3, P<.001) correlations between the C-CDS and the Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Inter-rater reliability for assessing interview performance was quantified with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 1,1). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and associated validity indices were used to analyze variables that distinguished graduates who did and did not pass the NPTE on their first attempt (α = 0.05). The ICC1,1 for assessing interview performance was 0.749. Performance on the verbal subscale of the GRE (ROC curve area = 0.734, p = 0.007) and behavioral interview (ROC curve area = 0.685, p = 0.034) were statistically significant predictors of NPTE performance.

Eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, sing a distinctive dawn song in the predawn darkness, and one hypothesis for its function is that it serves as an honest signal of male quality that females use during choice of within-pair or extrapair mates. Over a 2-year period, we quantified dawn songs of males to measure between- and within-season repeatability of the timing (start and end time) and length of song bouts, and song rate. We also measured morphological characters to measure repeatability and describe individual differences in body size and plumage quality. All song traits varied considerably among males, start time and song rates were repeatable between years, and all song rates were repeatable within both years. All morphological characters were significantly repeatable between years. Moreover, early singing males were larger and had relatively long flight feathers, and males that sang at high rates had relatively long flight feathers. Early singing males were also paired to the earliest breeding females, and in one year, male song rate was positively correlated with their social mate's clutch size. Relatively long flight feathers in other species are typical of older males and individuals of higher body condition, suggesting that, despite being suboscine passerines with relatively simple and innate songs, eastern kingbirds use song performance as an honest signal of male quality that females may use during mate choice. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","body size; dawn song; eastern kingbird; honest signalling; mate choice; plumage quality; repeatability; song rate; timing of song; Tyrannus tyrannus","body size; clutch size; extra-pair copulation; honest signaling; individual variation; life history trait; mate choice; morphology; pair bond; phenotypic plasticity; plumage; songbird; Tyrannus tyrannus","Murphy, M.T.; Department of Biology, Portland State UniversityUnited States; email: murphym@pdx.edu",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

In fish, nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual builders, but little is known about how consistent individual differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from four populations in mid-Wales, U.K., to complete three consecutive nests under standardized laboratory conditions. We quantified a number of structural components and design characteristics of nests and estimated repeatability (r) of these traits. Within populations, the number of threads used, the area of the nest and the mass of substrate deposited on top of the nest were all repeatable within males (0.39 < r < 0.51), showing that individual male three-spined sticklebacks differed consistently in the size and composition of the nests they produced. Our data support the hypothesis that nest characteristics may reveal important information about the quality of individual males, and that they may, at least in part, be under genetic control.

Methods: We assessed the psychometric properties ofthe 8-item Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS) in a sample of 58 methadone maintenance patients. Results: Internal consistency was modest, but similar to the original value (alpha = 0.62), and test-retest correlation at four months follow-up was moderately encouraging for a short instrument such as this (n = 31, test retest intraclass correlation = 0.58), and change at the mean level was minimal, but marginally significant (from an average of 3.3 to 3.8, p = 0.06). Analyses of nurse ratings of patients' behaviour at the clinic showed that SAPAS was significantly correlated with nurse ratings of externalizing behaviour (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), and Global Assessment of Functioning (r = -0.36, p = 0.006), but unrelated to intoxication (r = 0.02, NS), or withdrawal (r = 0.20, NS). Conclusion: There is evidence that the SAPAS is a modestly valid and relatively reliable brief screening measure of personality disorders in patients with ongoing substance abuse undergoing methadone maintenance. It can be used in situations where limited resources are available, and researchers or others wish to get an impression of the degree of personality pathology in a clinical population, as well as for screening purposes. © 2008 Hesse et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine derivative; buprenorphine; methadone; neuroleptic agent; adult; article; clinical assessment; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; drug intoxication; female; follow up; human; internal validity; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; nursing assessment; opiate addiction; patient attitude; personality disorder; psychological rating scale; Standardised Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale; test retest reliability; validation study; withdrawal syndrome; addiction; comorbidity; Denmark; evaluation; middle aged; multivariate analysis; personality test; psychologic test; psychological aspect; psychometry; regression analysis; reproducibility; Adult; Comorbidity; Denmark; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Opioid-Related Disorders; Personality Assessment; Personality Disorders; Psychometrics; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Substance-Related Disorders","Hesse, M.; Aarhus University, Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research, Copenhagen Division, Købmagergade 26E, 1150 Copenhagen C, Denmark; email: mortenhesse@crf.dk",,,1471244X,,BPMSC,"18221511","English","BMC Psychiatry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-40449117280

One important step in these studies is to estimate the repeatability of temperament traits, by replicating measures of an animal's behavioural or physiological reactions to a novel or stressful situation. When studies are performed in the field, several factors can affect repeatability estimates: (1) microenvironmental conditions prior to or during a test may affect the measured behaviour, and spatial heterogeneity in predation risk within the habitat of a population may affect repeatability; (2) a decrease over time in the strength of behavioural reactions as a result of habituation may bias repeatability; and (3) individuals may differ in their habituation. In this study we used a linear mixed-model approach to test for the occurrence of interindividual variation in behavioural reaction and habituation of eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, to a hole-board test and a handling bag test. We found high intraindividual consistency for the behaviours recorded both in the hole-board and handling bag tests; four temperament traits could be considered (i.e. activity/exploration, reaction to stress, emotionality and docility). Given that we found no phenotypic variation in habituation, chipmunks seem to show a behavioural carryover in activity/exploration and docility, which could have consequences for the evolutionary potential of habituation to novelty. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioural syndrome; docility; eastern chipmunks; exploration; habituation; hole-board; Tamias striatus; temperament trait","behavioral response; habituation; heterogeneity; physiological response; risk assessment; rodent; wild population; Animalia; Tamias striatus","Réale, D.; Université du Québec à MontréalCanada; email: reale.denis@uqam.ca",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

An experiment was developed that combines multifrequency shear wave actuation with broad-band motion sensitization to extend the dynamic range of a single MRE examination. With this strategy, multiple wave images corresponding to different driving frequencies are simultaneously received and can be analyzed by evaluating the dispersion of the complex modulus over frequency. The technique was applied on the brain and liver of five healthy volunteers. Its repeatability was tested by four follow-up studies in each volunteer. Five standard rheological models (Maxwell, Voigt, Zener, Jeffreys and fractional Zener model) were assessed for their ability to reproduce the observed dispersion curves. The three-parameter Zener model was found to yield the most consistent results with two shear moduli μ1 = 0.84 ± 0.22 (1.36 ± 0.31) kPa, μ2 = 2.03 ± 0.19 (1.86 ± 0.34) kPa and one shear viscosity of η = 6.7 ± 1.3 (5.5 ± 1.6) Pa s (interindividual mean ± SD) in brain (liver) experiments.

The objective is to develop and validate a structured, easy-to-use screening checklist for assessment of risk for violence in patients both during their stay in the ward and after discharge. The Preliminary Scheme 33 is a 33-item screening checklist with content domain inspired by the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management Scheme (HCR-20), the Brøset Violence Checklist, and eight risk factors ex-tracted from the literature on risk assessment. The Preliminary Scheme 33 was designed and tested in two steps by a research group which includes the authors. The common aim of both steps was to develop this into a time economical, reliable, and valid checklist. In the first step in 2006 the predictive validity of the individual items was tested. The present work presents results from the second step, a study conducted to assess the interrater reliability of the 33 items. Eight clinicians working in an acute psychiatric unit volunteered to be raters and were trained to score the 33 items on a three-point scale in relation to 15 clinical vignettes, which contained information from 15 acute psychiatric patients' files. Analysis showed high interrater reliability for the total score with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of .86 (95% CI: 0.74-0.94). However, a substantial proportion of the items had medium to low ICCs.

However, although entomologists have neglected the hypothesis that differences between individuals can play an important role in the ecology of a species, it is not new. Wellington (1957. Can. J. Zool. 35: 293-323) suggested that consistent individual differences in behaviour may play a role in the population dynamics of Malacosoma (Hübner, 1820) species (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae). We used a novel approach to determine if individual larval Malacosoma disstria Hübner, 1820 exhibit distinct and repeatable behavioural traits. Second-instar caterpillars were placed on individual arenas for 1 h on 4 consecutive days, and the proportion of time spent walking, searching, quiescent, and eating was documented. Active and sluggish behavioural types were distinguished and stable differences in individual activity were observed. Activity was positively correlated with growth during the 4 days of the experiment, but no significant relationship was detected between behaviour during the experiment and overall larval performance in the laboratory setting. These findings demonstrate consistent variation in the foraging behaviour of forest tent caterpillars and lay the basis for further investigatison of its role in colony function and population dynamics. © 2007 NRC.",,"Behavioral research; Ecology; Population dynamics; Entomologists; Forest tent caterpillars; Biodiversity; behavioral ecology; caterpillar; experimental study; foraging behavior; laboratory method; moth; population outbreak; Hexapoda; Lasiocampidae; Lepidoptera; Malacosoma; Malacosoma disstria","Despland, E.; Department of Biology, Concordia University, 7141 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, QC H4B 1R6, Canada; email: Despland@alcor.concordia.ca",,,00084301,,CJZOA,,"English","Can.

In species with alternative mating behaviours, sex ratio variation can induce switches between behaviour types and this, together with the consistency with which behaviours are expressed, may also affect the intensity of sexual selection. All these factors can be combined to elucidate individual mating behaviour profiles. The establishment of individual behavioural profiles for male mating behaviour in one species, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is the focus of this study; specifically, we ask whether individual male mating behaviour profiles show that males have consistent reproductive behaviour across contexts where the advantages of using alternative mating tactics differ. The frequency of both sneak mating and display behaviours varied between sex ratios. Male display and sneak frequency were highly repeatable and males maintained consistent rankings of behaviour under equal, male- and female-biased sex ratios. We conclude, therefore, that male guppies have individual mating behaviour profiles. The use of behavioural profiles fills a gap in the existing literature by allowing behaviours that are functionally related but not correlated, such as alternative mating behaviours, to be treated as an integrated unit. © 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioural profiles; behavioural syndromes; consistency; constraints; guppy; male mating behaviour; mating tactics; personality; Poecilia reticulata; repeatability; sex ratio","male behavior; mating behavior; reproductive behavior; sex ratio; sexual selection; teleost; Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia reticulata","Magellan, K.; Department of Ichthyology and Fisheries Science, Rhodes UniversitySouth Africa; email: k.magellan@ru.ac.za",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

At each of five sessions spaced over several weeks, participants were exposed to six imagery trials (two each of no-, low-, and high-intensity imagery scripts). After each trial, participants completed subjective measures of tobacco craving and mood. Ratings of craving and negative mood significantly increased as a function of smoking-urge intensity, which was consistent across the five sessions. Further, significant intraclass correlations indicated that craving and mood responses were highly reliable over the five sessions, as well as across two, three, and four sessions.

In this comment, we argue that Funder's claim is not a basic law of psychology, but a product of the common statistical approach to define person effects by Pearson correlations and situation effects by differences in group means. As an alternative, we suggest using Intraclass correlations (ICC) with an absolute agreement definition as indicators of intraindividual stability. This approach enables us to directly determine, how much people's behavior varies or remains the same across situations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ICC approach, by applying it to both hypothetical and empirical data.

In this study, the heritabilities of behavioural responses to the inspections of conjunctiva, auscultation and blood sampling and the genetic correlations among them were estimated in the Thoroughbred racehorse. The estimation was done with Bayesian analysis with Gibbs sampling based on the univariate or bivariate threshold animal models. The behavioural responses were scored with four categories at the first entrance quarantine in Miho Training Center of Japan Racing Association from 1993 to 1995. The behavioural responses were treated as categorical or binary traits, with both showing similar results. The estimated heritabilities were in the range of 0.23-0.28, suggesting a genetic component in the variation on these traits. The estimated genetic correlations among the traits were very high (approximately 0.9), suggesting that these behavioural responses may be measures of the same trait. Because of the high genetic correlations, repeatability threshold model was applied assuming the responses to be a genetically identical trait measured with three different tests. The estimated heritabilities (approximately 0.23) were at the lower bound of the former estimates. The revealed high repeatabilities (0.97-0.98) suggest a strong contribution of the individual temperament on the behaviour of racehorses. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.","Behavioural response; Genetic correlation; Gibbs sampling; Heritability; Thoroughbred racehorse","animal; animal behavior; article; biological model; genetic variability; genetics; horse; inbreeding; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Horses; Inbreeding; Models, Genetic; Variation (Genetics); Animalia; Congiopodidae","Oki, H.; Equine Research Institute, Japan Racing Association, 321-4 Tokami-cho, Utsunomiya City, Tochigi 320-0856, Japan; email: oki@center.equinst.go.jp",,,09312668,,JABAE,"17651320","English","J.

This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration- avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution.

It represents one of the longest outcome studies of youth psychopathy to date, and therefore addresses a primary criticism of the research area (i.e., lack of demonstrated associations between child and adult psychopathy features). Recruited participants were 475 males enrolled in the Minnesota Twin and Family Study who had completed a research-based measure of psychopathy features consisting of separate emotional detachment (or affective) and antisocial tendencies (or behavioral) subscales. These psychopathy features and various externalizing symptoms (i.e., conduct problems, impulsivity, and substance use disorder) were assessed through rating scales and structured diagnostic interview at an intake assessment (ages 16-18) and 6-year follow-up. Consistent with prediction, adolescent psychopathy features displayed moderate stability across the transition from adolescence to adulthood [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) = 0.40-0.41]. The antisocial tendencies subscale was uniquely related to most externalizing symptoms both in adolescence and in adulthood, whereas the emotional detachment subscale showed appropriate discriminant validity in its lack of association with externalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that psychopathy features are relatively stable from adolescence to adulthood and provide possible insights into the development and maintenance of externalizing difficulties during the adult transition. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adolescence; Adult transition; Externalizing; Psychopathy; Stability","addiction; adolescent; adult; age; article; follow up; human; longitudinal study; male; psychologic test; psychological aspect; psychopathy; twins; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Diseases in Twins; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Psychological Tests; Substance-Related Disorders; Twin Studies","Loney, B.R.; Department of Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States; email: loney@psy.fsu.edu",,,0096140X,,AGBED,"17444530","English","Aggress.

METHODS: Children were asked to wear a uniaxial accelerometer for 7 d four times throughout the course of about a year. A random-intercepts model was used to separate the inter- and intraindividual components of physical activity. Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), height, and month of measurement were fitted to the model as potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 315 children had valid data for at least two measurement occasions, and 244 had data for all four measurement occasions. The unadjusted intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for total activity (counts per minute) was 0.54; 0.49 after adjusting for gender, age, and BMI; and 0.53 after adjusting for gender, age, BMI, and month. Further adjustment for pubertal status at baseline had no effect on the ICC. Restricting the analysis to only those with data for all four measurement occasions (N = 244), or to measurements taken on schooldays only, had no effect on the ICC. The fully adjusted ICC was 0.51 for weekdays only and 0.39 for weekend days only. For minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, minutes of vigorous activity, minutes of sedentary behavior, and number of 30-min blocks of sedentary behavior, the fully adjusted ICC were 0.45, 0.37, 0.59, and 0.39, respectively. The analysis was repeated for boys and girls separately, but the differences in ICC were small. CONCLUSION: There was substantial intraindividual variation in the objectively measured physical activity of these children. Studies using single a measurement occasion where physical activity is the exposure should take this into account to adjust for regression dilution. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.","ALSPAC; Measurement error; Reliability; Seasonality; Variability","accelerometry; age; article; behavior; body height; body mass; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dilution; female; gender; human; male; measurement; physical activity; puberty; regression analysis; school child; seasonal variation; Child; Data Collection; Exercise; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons","Mattocks, C.; Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol, 24 Tyndall Avenue, Bristol, BS8 1TQ, United Kingdom; email: c.mattocks@bristol.ac.uk",,,01959131,,MSCSB,"17414799","English","Med.

Most studies of animal personality, particularly studies of individuals' variation in physiological mechanisms, have been conducted on selected individuals in controlled conditions. We attempted to detect consistent behaviors as well as physiological patterns in greylag ganders (Anser anser) from a free-roaming flock living in semi-natural conditions. We tested 10 individuals repeatedly, in a handling trial, resembling tests for characterization of ""temperaments"" in captive animals. We recorded the behavior of the same 10 individuals during four situations in the socially intact flock: (1) a ""low density feeding condition"", (2) a ""high density feeding condition"", (3) a ""low density post-feeding situation"" and (4) while the geese rested. We collected fecal samples for determination of excreted immuno-reactive corticosterone (BM) and testosterone metabolites (TM) after handling trials, as well as the ""low density feeding"" and the ""high density feeding"" conditions. BM levels were very highly consistent over the repeats of handling trials, and the ""low density feeding condition"" and tended to be consistent over the first two repeats of the ""high density feeding condition"". Also, BM responses tended to be consistent across contexts. Despite seasonal variation, there tended to be inter-test consistency of TM, which pointed to some individual differences in TM as well. Aggressiveness turned out to be a highly repeatable trait, which was consistent across social situations, and tended to correlate with an individual's resistance during handling trials. Also, ""proximity to the female partner"" and ""sociability"" - the average number of neighboring geese in a close distance while resting - were consistent. We conclude that aggressiveness, ""affiliative tendencies"" and levels of excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites may be crucial factors of personality in geese. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Two tests were performed 3 weeks apart. The 2nd test was feasible without relearning, a proof of memory, and was repeatable, a proof of consistency in the attention time. A significant difference was observed between the 3 age groups.Young horses often performed very well during the 1st test but their attention dropped in the 2nd test while older horses were more stable with respect to attention and even increased it slightly. The study shows that there are individual differences but it was not possible to prove a significant influence of breed, gender and paternal influence.

Both within-person variation and between-person differences can be related to outcome variables (e.g., emotions, life satisfaction). One major precondition for aggregating within-person data to the between-person level is sufficient reliability of the aggregated data, a point that has received scant attention in previous research. Drawing on the example of personal goal research, we recommend that the two major forms of the intraclass correlation coefficient-the ICC(1) and the ICC(2)-be applied to within-person data in idiographic research designs.

METHOD: The sample consisted of 209 children with pervasive developmental disorder referred for genetic studies. The 12 subdomains of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were used in a factor analysis, and the emerged factors were then correlated with independent variables (measures of cognition, adaptive function, and diagnostic subtype). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate any familial relationships between sibling pairs on the derived factors. RESULTS: The autism symptom phenotype is indeed made up of three factors or domains that are somewhat different than those used in DSM-IV. Rather, domains include social-communication, inflexible language and behavior, and repetitive sensory and motor behavior. For the three factors, only a small amount of variance was accounted for by cognitive and adaptive functioning. Only inflexible language and behavior showed familial correlation between siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The pervasive developmental disorder symptom phenotype is composed of three domains or factors: social-communication, inflexible language and behavior, and repetitive sensory and motor behavior. Each child with pervasive developmental disorder can be characterized by these dimensions, which give an informative picture of the clinical presentation and a quantitative estimate of the severity of the disability.

In Great Britain, the 'Health of the Nation Outcome Scales, HoNOS' were developed to assess the health and social functioning of patients with mental disorders. Aims: To examine the psychometric properties, especially the feasibility and reliability, of a German version of the HoNOS (HoNOS-D) and to thus provide international data for the comparison of different mental health services. Sampling and Methods: The HoNOS was translated into German (HoNOS-D) in an extensive and multilayered consensus procedure. The HoNOS-D was then reviewed within the framework of a pilot study on quality assurance measures implemented by the German statutory health insurance institutes in 11 hospitals. Assessments were made of the psychometric qualities of feasibility and reliability using a representative sample of patients with mental and behavioral disorders. Results: An analysis of the feasibility of the HoNOS-D showed a range of missing values between 1.3 and 4.5% for 11 of the 12 items. An item analysis showed that three items of the HoNOS-D are particularly positively skewed. In most instances, the individual items of the rating scale exhibited only slight correlations to each other. With regard to retest reliability, satisfactory intraclass correlations between 0.80 and 0.91 were seen for 9 of the 12 items. Conclusions: The authors of the original version of the HoNOS [Wing et al.:Br J Psychiatry 1998;172:11-18] primarily emphasized the feasibility of the instrument and the independence of the individual items and dimensions. The analysis of the missing values showed satisfactory results for feasibility. The intercorrelation matrix of the individual items also exhibited only few correlations >0.30. The retest reliability also proves to be satisfactory for the majority of the items. The narrow distribution of some of the items must be critically discussed in comparison to analyses of results in other countries (e.g. Great Britain) and other settings (e.g. inpatient psychiatric hospitals or outpatient psychotherapy).

Individual differences were apparent in all 15 call parameters analysed, many with a high level of repeatability. Moreover, the information capacity of mew calls allows as many as 515 different signatures to exist in the system. As many parameters showed strong sex differences, separate discriminant functions were used to predict individual identity within each sex. Five parameters were used in a function that correctly identified over 90% of female calls in both a training (n=35) and test dataset (n=11) not used to generate the function. Among males, a separate function used six parameters to correctly assign individual identity in 89.3% (n=84; training) and 77.8% (n=27; test) of cases. Three original parameters, including spectral and spatial characteristics, were highly correlated with functions predicting identity in both sexes. The accuracy of functions was not influenced by a signaller's sex, breeding status, or by sampling period which was spread over as much as two breeding seasons within individuals. Significant potential therefore exists for bell miners to use these simple provisioning calls in individual discrimination. If this is the case, call information also has the potential to be used by receivers as predicted by signalling hypotheses proposed to account for cooperative helping behaviour, such as the pay-to-stay and social prestige hypotheses. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,"altruism; breeding population; calling behavior; endemic species; eusociality; individual variation; nestling; passerine; recognition; sex-related difference; Australasia; Australia; Manorina melanophrys; Meliphagidae; Moho braccatus","McDonald, P.G.; Department of Zoology, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Vic. 3086, Australia; email: paul.mcdonald@bangor.ac.uk",,,09088857,,JAVBE,,"English","J.

In the scorpionfly Panorpa vulgaris, both sexes show mating preferences on the basis of the condition of the potential partners. Females prefer males that produce nuptial gifts (i.e. salivary secretions) during copulation, while males invest more nuptial gifts in females of high nutritional status. Both characters, males' ability to produce nuptial gifts and high nutritional status of females, are known to be reliable indicators of foraging ability. Thus, besides possible direct benefits, both sexes might also obtain indirect benefits in terms of ""good foraging genes"" by their choice and thereby increase the fitness of their offspring. A prerequisite for this possibility is the heritability of the respective trait. In the present study, we estimated the repeatability and the heritability of foraging ability. Our results indicate (1) a significant repeatability of individual foraging efficiencies in males and females and (2) a heritable component of this trait by a significant parent-offspring regression. These findings suggest that genetic benefits in terms of increased offspring foraging ability might contribute to selection for mating preferences in both sexes. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Foraging ability; Heritability; Indirect benefits; Scorpionflies; Sexual selection","female behavior; foraging behavior; heritability; individual variation; insect; male behavior; mating behavior; nuptial gift; Mecoptera; Panorpa vulgaris","Missoweit, M.; Institute for Evolutionary Biology and Ecology, University of Bonn, An der Immenburg 1, Bonn 53121, Germany; email: mmissoweit@evolution.uni-bonn.de",,,03405443,,BESOD,,"English","Behav.

For this reason and due to the importance they present by themselves, carrying out an adequate assessment of them is fundamental. Mental health professionals have diverse opinions about the value and importance of the different informants. The majority choose of their sources according to the disorder and necessities of each evaluator. On the other hand, the need to obtain data about adolescents' functioning from multiple resources has been emphasised and numerous reasons have been exposed. Concretely, the fact of carrying out the most objective and complete evaluations as possible has been considered essential in those studies aimed at evaluating behavioural alteration in adolescents. For this reason, Achenbach developed three versions of his scale: one for the parents, another for the teachers and a third one for the adolescents themselves. Numerous investigations have studied the concordance between groups of informants about different behavioural alterations in adolescents, but none have carried out a complete analysis of all informants in all subscales (not only the total ones). For this reason, the current study has been developed with the aim of contributing to obtain an enriching vision for the professional in the field. Objectives: a) To systematically explore agreement patterns between adolescents, teachers and parents who inform of behavioural problems in adolescents in the general population and b) in those cases in which no agreement is found, to analyse the level of disagreement between each pair of informants for each subscale. Methodology: Cross-sectional and descriptive study. Participants. The study was formed by 160 triads of parents, teachers and 13-16 year old adolescents selected from several schools in Barcelona. Instruments. The three forms of the Achenbach scale to measure behavioural alterations were applied. The scale was translated into Spanish by the Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnostic in Psychopathology of the Development of the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona: Youth Self-Report, self-evaluated, Child Behaviour Checklist/4-18 and Teacher's Report Form, both heteroevaluated and completed by parents and teachers, respectively. These three forms contain a 89-item set that evaluates the same behaviour, where eight items are organised in scales of syndromes derived empirically and which are invariant throughout informants. The eight subscales are: withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. Some of them are grouped in second order factors: the first three in internalising, the last two in externalising, and the rest of them provide a total problems punctuation. Statistical procedure. Agreement values were analysed for each pair of informants and each subscale through the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). A value below 0.40 indicates low concordance. In these cases, the statistical analysis proceeds with the discordance analysis by pairs of informants and for each subscale through the Bland Altman Method. Results: A low concordance (below 0.40) between informants was found especially in internalizing scales (0.230). A slightly higher value was found in attention (0.334), aggressive behaviour (0.371), externalizing (0.357), and total subscales (0.327). Secondly, it was observed that, when informing about somatic complains, thought and attention problems, internalising items and the total scale, parents reported more alterations, followed by adolescents and teachers. Also, parents indicated more withdrawal problems in adolescents, although in this case they were followed by teachers and adolescents themselves. Finally, in the evaluation of the anxiety/depression scales, social problems, delinquent behaviour, aggressiveness and externalising conducts, adolescents informed of more alterations followed by their parents, and then by the teachers. Regarding the agreement/disagreement variability throughout the scales scores, the discordance between different informants was higher when the punctuation was further away from normality, generally when the scales were scored higher. Discussion: The normative criteria of comparison and the reference frames for each group of informants are different. For instance, the fact that teachers report less behavioural alterations could be explained because of their familiarity in dealing with adolescents and a higher tolerance towards some behaviors. In general terms, this result fits in with most conclusions from investigations carried out in this field. On the other hand, the fact that parents inform of more internalising problems could be attributed to adolescent behaviour which would in turn alter the family context. Another explanation might be that parents are on the whole more implicated and more sensitive in detecting certain conducts or behavioural alterations in their offspring. In any case, it is disputable whether the lack of concordance between the different informants does really exist or, on the contrary, adolescent behaviour changes depending on the context. Finally, a result contradicting those found in the studies reviewed is that adolescents are the ones who report more externalising problems. Other authors have found that adolescents inform more about internalising problems, something which should be expected taking into account that they are the ones who know themselves better. This could be possibly explained by the presence of more social desirability/undesirability among the adolescents of our sample in front of their pair group when answering to the evaluation scales; this may be due to the group context in which the case was applied. The main limitation of the present study that it was carried out with a general population sample, although from another point of view this may be considered as a gain of the study. We recommend carrying out explicative studies about discordance, which could clarify the predictive validity of each informant group and make variations in the type of sample under study. Conclusions: Data from different sources contribute with specific information of relative validity. This is why a multidimensional, multisituational and mulitiinformant approach is fundamental. This is necessary not only to evaluate behavioural alterations in adolescents within a research context, but also when taking diagnostic decisions in a clinical context, because, depending on the chosen informant, the diagnostic criteria for one disorder or another might change. Also, our results imply that there may be an underdetection of behavioural problems in adolescents by the adults, which would result in a lower psychological demand than the necessary.","Achenbach; Adolescents; Agreement; Behaviour problems; Informants","adolescent; aggression; anxiety; article; attention disturbance; checklist; child behavior; child parent relation; correlation coefficient; depression; female; human; juvenile delinquency; major clinical study; male; psychological rating scale; psychosocial withdrawal; school health service; social problem; Spain; statistical analysis; teacher; thought disorder","Medina, C.; Unidad de Investigación en Psicopatología Y Neuropsicología, Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain; email: cristina.medina@uab.es",,"Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente",01853325,,SAMEF,,"Spanish","Salud Ment.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37049031655

Measures of temperament were gathered over 3 repeated observations (60-d interval) of yearling, fall-born Brahman bulls (initial BW = 320 ± 4 kg; n = 66). Temperament assessments included exit velocity (EV), which was the rate at which the bulls exited the squeeze chute and traversed a fixed distance (1.83 m); pen scores (PEN; 1 = quiet to 5 = excited), ascertained from animal behavior while penned in small groups (n = 5); and chute scores (CHUTE; 1 = quiet to 5 = excited), determined from behavioral responses to restraint on the weigh scale. Temperament measures obtained during the initial data collection (d 0) were all positively correlated (r ≥ 0.35, P < 0.005) with one another. Additionally, PEN (r = 0.29, P < 0.05) and EV (r = 0.26, P < 0.05) were positively correlated with CS, whereas CHUTE was not (r = 0.09, P = 0.46). All serial EV measures were positively correlated (r > 0.31, P < 0.02). All PEN were positively correlated (r > 0.31, P < 0.01), whereas serial measures of CHUTE were not (P > 0.3). Exit velocity was positively correlated with CS within d 0 (r = 0.26, P = 0.04) and 120 (r = 0.44, P < 0.01). The EV data obtained at d O were transformed into a discrete variable, EV ranking (EV RANK; 1 to 3 scale), in which 1 equated to <1 SD below the mean and 3 equated to >1 SD above the mean. Mean EV (P < 0.01) decreased from d 0 (2.82 ± 0.07 m/sec) to 120 (2.11 ± 0.10 m/sec). Time also influenced (P < 0.01) CS; mean CS decreased between d 0 (14.6 ± 0.7 ng/mL) and 120 (11.1 ± 0.8 ng/mL). Measures of EV can be a valuable tool for the assessment of cattle temperament and a possible predictor of temperament and stress responsiveness to future animal handling events. ©2006 American Society of Animal Science.

Two subjective measures of temperament (crush score and flight speed score) were also available for over 2000 of these animals. Temperament measures were recorded post-weaning (average age 8 months) and again at the start of finishing (average age 19 months) on a subset of the animals. Nine meat quality traits were measured on these animals and included measures on 2 different muscles [M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) and M. semitendinosus (ST)]. The heritability of flight time measured post-weaning and at the start of finishing was 0.30 and 0.34, respectively, with a repeatability of 0.46 across the measurement times. Heritabilities for scored temperament traits were 0.21, 0.19, and 0.15 for post-weaning flight speed score, post-weaning crush score, and start of finishing crush score, respectively. Genetic correlations across measurement times for flight time were 0.98 and 0.96 for crush score, indicating a strong underlying genetic basis of these temperament measures over time; however, the corresponding phenotypic correlations were lower (0.48 and 0.37, respectively). Longer flight times (i.e. better temperament) were genetically correlated with improved tenderness (i.e. lower shear force and higher tenderness scores), with genetic correlations of -0.42 and 0.33 between LTL shear force, and Meat Standards Australia (MSA) tenderness, respectively. Genetic correlations between post-weaning crush score and the same meat quality traits were 0.39 and -0.47, respectively. However, genetic and phenotypic correlations between measures of temperament and other meat quality traits were generally low, with the exception of crush scores with LTL Minolta a* value (-0.37 and -0.63 for post-weaning and start of finishing measurement time, respectively). Predicted correlated responses of -0.17 kg LTL shear force and 2.6 MSA tenderness points per generation were predicted based on the genetic parameter estimates and a recording regime of both flight time and crush scores. Selection based on the measures of temperament described in this study could be used to improve temperament itself and correlated improvements can also occur in meat tenderness and eating quality traits in tropically adapted breeds of cattle. © CSIRO 2006.","Flight speed; Genetic correlation; Heritability; Tenderness","activity pattern; breeding population; cattle; flight behavior; genetics; heritability; meat; phenotype; temperature effect; weaning; Australasia; Australia; Animalia; Bos taurus","Johnston, D.J.; Animal Genetics and Breeding Unit, NSW Department of Primary Industries, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; email: djohnsto@pobox.une.edu.au",,,00049409,,AJAEA,,"English","Aust.

Some previous studies have found significant associations between the 2D:4D index and sexual, psychological or behavioural variables. We studied the usability of the radiographic 2D:4D index as a potential predictor of several features in a large female sample. Methods: 271 female dentists and 219 teachers (age 45 - 63 years) had their hands radiographed and their right 2nd and 4th fingers measured from the base of the bony proximal phalanxes to the tip of the distal phalanxes to define the radiographic 2D:4D index. The study subjects were classified into two distinctly separate clusters (by using cluster analysis with the K-means algorithm) in each of the following dimensions: anthropometric (including four items), behavioural (five items), nutritional (five items), health-related (seven items), occupational (Karasek job control and job demand scores) and fertility (four items). Results: The radiographic 2D:4D index ranged from 0.845 to 0.981 (mean 0.925, SD 0.021). The intraclass correlation between three radiographers' measurements (31 cases) was 0.971. No differences concerning the 2D:4D index were found between clusters 1 and 2 in any studied dimension, nor did any of the items in clusters have relations with the 2D:4D index when tested separately with bivariate tests. Conclusion: Despite the ideal set-up of the measuring possibilities in a relatively large radiographic material the variables currently studied were not dependent on the length of finger bones. It can therefore be questioned whether any real associations between the bony 2D:4D index in adult life and (direct or indirect) hormone dependent effects exist. There may be a publication bias explaining that mostly positive findings have been the previously reported. However, the associations of the 2D:4D index with various features, if present, may be related to the soft parts of fingers rather than to the length of bones. © 2006 Vehmas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; anthropometry; article; behavior change; cluster analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; distal phalanx; female; female fertility; hand radiography; health behavior; human; independent variable; index finger; lifestyle; multivariate analysis; normal human; nutritional assessment; nutritional health; occupational health; rating scale; Adult; Anthropometry; Behavior; Body Mass Index; Cluster Analysis; Diet; Employment; Female; Fertility; Fingers; Humans; Middle Aged; Personality; Women's Health","Vehmas, T.; Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Topeliuksenkatu 41 a A, FIN-00250 Helsinki, Finland; email: tapio.vehmas@ttl.fi",,,14775751,,,"16930494","English","J.

Box 1564, D-82305 Starnberg, Germany","In many species of passerine birds yearlings display a less elaborate version of the adult secondary sexual traits, but the causes of such differences in ornamentation are not always well understood. We studied age-related changes in blue tit Parus caeruleus UV/blue structural crown coloration, a sexually selected trait. In our Austrian study population, older blue tits, irrespective of sex, displayed on average a more ultraviolet (lower hue, higher UV chroma), more chromatic and brighter crown coloration than yearlings. This age dichromatism was caused by within-individual changes in the expression of crown coloration between years since males and females became more UV, more chromatic and brighter as they aged. Colour biased survival did not contribute to the observed pattern of age dichromatism since crown coloration was largely unrelated to overwinter survival. Between-year repeatability of crown colour was significant for most colour variables but low in general, and lower for females than for males. In the blue tit, yearling males might benefit from being less ornamented by avoiding adult aggression but at the expense of sexual attractiveness. Adaptive explanations of blue tit age dichromatism should however take into account that age effects were of similar magnitude in males and females. This suggests that both male and female yearlings could benefit from being less ornamented and hence that sexual selection might be acting on both sexes simultaneously in this species. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,"age structure; aggression; color; female behavior; ornamentation; passerine; population structure; sexual behavior; survival; ultraviolet radiation; Austria; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Aves; Parus caeruleus; Passeriformes","Delhey, K.; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell, Germany; email: delhey@orn.mpg.de",,,09088857,,JAVBE,,"English","J.

A clinician-administered rating scale of self-destructive behavior was included. Psychopathological variables were assessed by standardized questionnaires. Results: The self-report questionnaires demonstrated good reliability (α=.81-.96, split-half r=.78-.98, test-retest r=.65-.91). Reliability of the clinician-administered ratings was acceptable (interrater κ=.46-.77, test-retest κ=.35-.48). Intraclass correlations (ICC=.68) for all three instruments were satisfactory. Rates of self-harm and associations between self-harm and suicidal behaviors are reported. The findings support the hypotheses of a higher degree of psychiatric symptomatology in patients with self-harm behavior compared to those without.

Preterm birth has been associated with increased parenting stress in early infancy, and some reports have found this to be a risk factor for later behavioral problems. There are, however, few studies and conflicting results. Information about the fathers is scarce. OBJECTIVES. Our goal was to study the effects of an early-intervention program on parenting stress after a preterm birth until 1 year corrected age. METHODS. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted including infants with a birth weight <2000 g treated at the University Hospital of North Norway Trust, which serves the 2 northern-most counties in Norway, to examine the effects of a modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program on parenting stress measured by the Parenting Stress Index. A term control group was also recruited. The Parenting Stress Index was administered to the mothers at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and to the fathers at 12 months' corrected age. The intervention consisted of 8 sessions shortly before discharge and 4 home visits by specially trained nurses focusing on the infant's unique characteristics, temperament, and developmental potential and the interaction between the infant and the parents. RESULTS. Seventy-one infants were included in the preterm intervention group, and 69 were included in the preterm control group. The preterm groups were well balanced. Seventy-four infants were included in the term control group. Compared with the preterm controls, both the mothers and fathers in the preterm intervention group reported significant lower scores in child domain, parent domain, and total stress on all occasions except the mother-reported child domain at 12 months. These differences were not related to birth weight or gestational age. The level of stress among the preterm intervention group was comparable to their term peers. Both parents in the intervention group reported consistently lower scores within the distractibility/hyperactivity, reinforces parents, competence, and attachment subscales compared with the preterm control group. There were no differences in mean summary stress scores between the mothers and fathers in the 2 preterm groups at 12 months, but the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS. This early-intervention program reduces parenting stress among both mothers and fathers of preterm infants to a level comparable to their term peers. We are now studying whether this will result in long-term beneficial effects.

(1990), The sources of human psychological differences: the Minnesota study of twins reared apart, Science 250, 223-228] has demonstrated that MZA pairs are as similar in most respects as MZ pairs reared together. Some polygenic traits - e.g. stature, IQ, harm avoidance, negative emotionality, interest in sports - are polygenic-additive, so pairs of relatives resemble one another on the given trait in proportion to their genetic similarity. But the existence and the intensity of other important psychological traits seem to be emergent properties of gene configurations (or configurations of independent and partially genetic traits) that interact multiplicatively rather than additively. Monozygotic (MZ) twins may be strongly correlated on such emergenic traits, while the similarity of dizygotic (DZ) twins, sibs or parent-offspring pairs may be much less than half that of MZ pairs. Some emergenic traits, although strongly genetic, do not appear to run in families. MISTRA has provided at least two examples of traits for which MZA twins are strongly correlated, and DZA pairs correlate near zero, while DZ pairs reared together (DZTs) are about half as similar as MZTs. These findings suggest that even more traits may be emergenic than those already identified. Studies of adoptees reared together (who are perhaps more common than twins reared apart) may help to identify traits that are emergenic, but that also are influenced by a common rearing environment. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Epistasis; Heritability; Polygenic additivity; Psychophysiology","avoidance behavior; body build; correlation analysis; dizygotic twins; emergenesis; emotionality; epistasis; harm reduction; heritability; human; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; monozygotic twins; multifactorial inheritance; negative emotionality; priority journal; psychophysiology; rearing; review; sport; Adolescent; Child; Child Rearing; Child, Preschool; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Determinism; Humans; Pedigree; Personality; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Social Environment; Twin Studies; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Variation (Genetics)","Lykken, D.T.825 Summit Avenue, Apt. 1106, Minneapolis, MN 55403, United States; email: dlykken@tfs.psych.umn.edu",,,16011848,,GBBEA,"16716200","English","Genes Brain Behav.",Review,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646909081

Method: First, the 3 US versions of the questionnaires were translated into French by 3 French-English bilingual translators (who were native speakers), and the translations were then discussed by an expert committee to ensure that the concept explored within the French context was efficiently targeted. Second, the psychometric properties of the French version were investigated in a cross-sectional, multicentre study. The questionnaires were completed by 148 children and adolescents, aged 9 years or older and with various conditions, who were followed in 3 university hospital outpatient clinics and 2 ambulatory psychiatry units, and also by their parents and therapists. Results: The instruments were quick and easy to administer, and acceptability was good.

Although everyone working in routine mental health services recognizes the scientific and ethical importance to ensure that treatments being provided are of highest quality, there is a clear lack of consensus regarding what outcome domains to include, what measure of assessment to use and, moreover, who to question when assessing. Literature findings. Since the fifties, social functioning is considered as an important dimension to take into account for treatment planning and outcome measuring. But for many years, symptoms scales have been considered as sufficient outcome measures and social functioning improvement expected on the basis of symptoms alleviation. As symptoms and social adjustment sometimes appear relatively independent, no accurate conclusion concerning the patient's social functioning can so be driven on the basis of his clinical symptoms. More attention has then been directed toward the development of instruments specifically intended to measure the extent and nature of social functioning impairments observed in most psychiatric syndromes. Many of these instruments are designed to be completed by caregivers or remain time consuming and difficult to use routinely. Presently, in clinical practice, there is a need to rely on simple and brief instruments considering patients'perspective about their social adjustment as a function of time. Aim of the study. The aim of this study is to present a new instrument, the QFS, initially developed in order to assess social functioning in patients involved in group psychotherapy programs conducted in a specialist mental health setting, as well as its psychometric characteristics. Methodology. It was designed to be completed in less than 10 minutes and the questions are phrased in a simple and redundant way, in order to limit problems inherent to illiteracy or language comprehension. The QFS is a 16 items self-report instrument that assesses both the frequency of (8 items) and the satisfaction with (8 items) various social beha viours adopted during the 2 weeks period preceding the assessment. It yields three separate indexes of social functioning, defined a priori and labelled «frequency», «satisfaction» and «global». The higher the scores, the better the social functioning. The QFS was administered to 457 subjects, aged between 18 and 65, including 176 outpatients (99 with anxious or depressive disorders, 25 with personality disorders and 52 with psychotic disorders) and 281 healthy control subjects. Results. No significant difference was found between patients and controls according to age or gender distribution. Acceptance rate was high (&gt; 95 %). Moreover, the QFS was generally acceptable to the clinicians who used it. Internal consistency calculated for each index ranged from 0.65 to 0.83 (Cronbach α). Test-retest reliability, calculated within a 15 days time interval on a sample of 49 healthy controls, ranged from 0.69 to 0.71 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Discriminant validity was calculated on healthy controls and patients divided into sub-groups according to their diagnosis. It showed to be excellent, with significantly higher scores in control subjects than in psychiatric patients and significant differences across diagnostic categories (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc tests, all p &lt; 0.05). The convergent validity of the QFS with other measures of social functioning was calculated, using the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS) and the Social Adjustment Scale Self-Report (SAS-SR). With the SASS, the convergent validity was higher among patients (Spearman rS 0.71 to 0.92, p &lt; 0.01) than controls (rS from 0.49 to 0.66, p &lt; 0.001). In healthy controls, correlation with the SAS-SR was moderate but statistically significant (rS from - 0.21 to - 0.44, p &lt; 0.05). When comparing QFS scores with self-rated symptoms severity, lower levels of social functioning were significantly associated with more severe symptoms according to the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI : rS from - 0.38 to - 0.65, p &lt; 0.001). The QFS indexes demonstrated sensitivity to change (Wilcoxon : all p &lt; 0.05) on a sample of 27 out-patients suffering from anxious-depressive disorders questioned before and after 4 months of cognitive behavioural group therapy running on a weekly basis during 16 sessions of 2 hours each. The factorial validity of the QFS was measured through 3 separate factor analysis conducted using the data of 457 subjects. The first analysis considered only Frequency items ; 7 out of 8 items had loadings above 0.5 on Factor 1 accounting for 30.7 % (unrotaded) of the variance. The second analysis considered only Satisfaction items ; all items had loadings above 0.6 on Factor 1 explaining 43.4 % (unrotaded) of the variance. And finally, in the third factor analysis, all QFS items were included ; 15 out of 16 items had loadings above 0.4 on Factor 1 accounting for 30 % (unrotated) of the variance. Concerning the factorial validity of the instrument, these results suggest that all QFS items belong to the same underlying dimension. Discussion. Finally, provisional norms for the QFS are provided for healthy controls, in order to characterise individual patients or patient subgroups. In conclusion, the need for assessment in clinical routine, in order to estimate different aspects of patients conditions as well as the quality of the treatment provided, has contributed to the development of a large variety of instruments measuring several domains. Concerning the level of social functioning, many instruments fail to meet chief criterion of feasibility, remaining often too complex or time onsuming. Moreover, only few of them are available in French. Conclusion. The QFS presented here is a brief, simple and easy to administer self-rating scale that displays satisfactory psychometric properties. It seems to be a valuable instrument for the monitoring of social functioning in psychiatric patients which, from a therapeutic point of view, may have a clear impact as it sets up expectation of change and allows both to reality test patients and therapists beliefs about the presence of progress or not and to identify if therapy is working on this specific outcome domain. Though, to date, the administration of the QFS to other populations and treatment modalities requires further investigation.","Mental disorders; Satisfaction; Self-rating scale; Social functioning; Validation","adult; aged; analysis of variance; article; Brief Symptom Inventory; comprehension; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; Cronbach alpha coefficient; data analysis; depression; disease severity; factorial analysis; female; group therapy; health program; human; instrument validation; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; mental health center; outpatient; patient monitoring; patient satisfaction; personality disorder; post hoc analysis; psychometry; psychosis; psychotherapy; questionnaire; rank sum test; rating scale; satisfaction; self report; sensitivity analysis; social behavior; social interaction; statistical significance; test retest reliability","Zanello, A.; Département de Psychiatrie, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, 2, chemin du Petit-Bel-Air, CH-1225 Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland",,"Elsevier Masson SAS",00137006,,ENCEA,"16633290","French","Encephale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645004175

A secondary aim was to test the effect of dietary restraint on the food intake of female participants. Methods: Mixed model analyses were used to compare average food intake across sessions, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were employed to compare within subject variability to total variance. High and low restraint females and low restraint males consumed four lunches in a Universal Eating Monitor (UEM) laboratory. The lunches consisted of one type of sandwich (chicken salad sandwich squares) or three types of sandwiches (chicken salad, ham, and turkey sandwich squares) presented in counterbalanced order. Results: Measures of food intake were stable for men and women, regardless of sandwich variety. In females, level of dietary restraint (high vs. low) did not significantly affect food intake.

However, there is a lack of information regarding the consistency of such individual differences, which is important to understand the probability of a certain individual trait to be inherent, i.e. genetically linked. The goal of this study is to quantify the consistency of individual differences in growth, feed intake/efficiency and feeding behaviour in African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell 1822). Forty-eight juvenile fish (58.9 ± 0.4 g) were housed individually for 47 days and weighed every second week. The consistency of growth, feed efficiency (residual feed intake (RFI)) and feeding behaviour (total feeding time (TFT)) was determined using repeatability estimates. Fish exhibited pronounced individual variation in growth (CV = 52.8%). feed intake (34.3%) and in the TFT (> 100%). The repeatability estimates were 0.55 for growth, 0.70 for feed intake, 0.49 for RFI and 0.81 for TFT. Individual differences in growth were mainly explained by individual differences in feed intake (∼ 80%). Individual differences in feeding behaviour contributed to explain differences in feed intake by affecting the RFI. With increasing TFT, the maintenance levels also increased suggesting that slow eaters were less efficient in feed/energy utilization. The results of this study indicate that individual differences in growth, feed intake/efficiency and feeding behaviour are consistent over time and therefore probably inherent. Moreover, this study may have implications on the use of feeding behaviour as a predictor of feed efficiency in juveniles of African catfish. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Feeding behaviour; Genetic; Individual housing; Individual variation; Repeatability; Residual feed intake","assimilation efficiency; feeding behavior; fish culture; growth rate; individual variation; Clarias gariepinus","Martins, C.I.M.; Aquaculture and Fisheries Group, PO Box 338, 6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; email: catarina.martins@wur.nl",,,1355557X,,AQREF,,"English","Aquac.

Using chaffinches Fringilla coelebs temporarily held in captivity, we determined the extent to which activity level (AL), the behavioural response to a stressful situation (BRSS) and two anti-predation risk behaviours when exposed to a model predator were inter-correlated within individuals. We assayed AL and BRSS when the chaffinches were first put in an experimental room. Subsequently we recorded their initial response (freeze or escape) to the sudden appearance of a model hawk, in addition to their latency to resume activity afterwards as a measure of cautiousness ('latency'). Each bird was assayed in two situations that differed in the risk level posed and in the assumed optimal response required to minimize predation risk: (1) high risk, when the hawk flew directly over the chaffinch and the assumed optimal response was to escape; and (2) low risk, when the model hawk flew 2 m to the side of the chaffinch and, since the bird was not being targeted, the assumed optimal response was to freeze in order to avoid attracting attention. All of the variables had relatively high repeatabilities and were inter-correlated, providing strong evidence for a behavioural syndrome. Though propensity to freeze was much greater in the low risk treatment, AL was negatively correlated with freezing behaviour in both risk treatments, and therefore there was a 'behavioural carryover' across situations. While hypoactive individuals were more likely to freeze in the low risk treatment, and were therefore assumed to be better able to assess risk compared to hyperactive individuals, some hypoactive individuals also froze in the high risk situation when it was assumed to be inappropriate to do so. Despite this apparently maladaptive behaviour in the high risk situation, overall hypoactive individuals showed a greater degree of behavioural plasticity across treatments compared to hyperactives. Taken together our results support the hypothesis of differential predation risk among personality types. We discuss the implications of our results for current interest in personalities, and for predation risk and group-living theories. © Brill Academic Publishers 2005.","Activity level; Anti-predation behaviour; Behavioural correlation; Behavioural plasticity; Coping style; Cryptic behaviour; Freeze behaviour; Personality; Stress","Animalia; Aves; Fringilla; Fringilla coelebs","Quinn, J.L.; Edward Grey Institute, Zoology Department, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom; email: john.quinn@zoo.ox.ac.uk",,,00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748638207

In this study, we investigated the long-term intra-individual consistency of the reaction towards social separation in dairy cows, Bos taurus taurus. In 35 animals, behavioural and adrenocortical reactions towards a 20 min social separation were examined. The separation test was carried out four times over a period of two lactations. Our subjects showed the expected reactions of cattle towards social separation such as exploration, walking, vocalisation, defecation, urination, and an increase in saliva cortisol concentration. We calculated a high repeatability of all behaviours tested and of saliva cortisol response towards this stressor throughout two lactations. Particular parameters (saliva cortisol response, duration of exploration, and number of entered squares) decreased across repetitions indicating a habituation. In contrast, the frequency of vocalisation, vigilance, and walking did not change across repetitions. Consequently, the different temporal changes of the measures may reflect that the response is mediated by different motivations. To address this issue, we examined the potential underlying structure of behaviour using principal component analysis. We could distinguish three principal components reflecting sociability, exploration, and anxiety. These three components are included in two (Neuroticism, Extraversion) of the five main dimensions known from human personality structure. In conclusion, the intra-individual behavioural consistency can be explained in terms of underlying personality structures, which show considerable generality across species. In farm animals, consideration of personality structures may be crucial concerning animal welfare. © Brill Academic Publishers 2005.","Behaviour; Consistency; Dairy cow; Personality; Saliva cortisol; Social separation","Animalia; Bos taurus","Müller, R.; Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of British Columbia, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; email: rmueller@interchange.ubc.ca",,,00057959,,,,"English","Behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746862747

Established measures are needed to study Latino groups, and short-term test-retest reliability findings are needed to provide context for clinical treatment and outcome studies. Methods: Inter-rater reliability (IRR) and short-term (5-14 days) test-retest reliability (TRR) of the S-EDE (using intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs]) were examined in a non-clinical study group of 60 monolingual Latina women. Results: IRR was excellent for objective bulimic episodes (ICC = 0.99) but was modest for subjective bulimic episodes (ICC = 0.55). TRR was good for objective bulimic episodes (ICC = 0.79) but was unacceptable for subjective bulimic episodes (ICC = 0.22). IRR and TRR kappa coefficients (0.56 and 0.37, respectively) for identifying the presence or absence of objective bulimic episodes were modest. For the S-EDE subscales, both IRR (ICCs ranged from 0.80 to 0.98) and TRR (ICCs ranged from 0.67 to 0.90) were good to excellent. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary support for the reliability of the S-EDE for use with Latina women. The constructs of eating disorder psychopathology measured by the S-EDE subscales (restraint, eating concern, weight concern, and shape concern) and the core feature of binge eating (objective bulimic episodes) show high short-term consistency. The results for subjective bulimic episodes are consistent with previous studies that have questioned whether these eating behaviors are reliable indicators of eating disorders. Additional evaluation is needed with clinical groups.

Under natural conditions, group-hoarding behavior among gerbils can be invoked by artificially supplying grain. All group members older than 20-day-old pups hoard grain by storing it in their burrows. During May 2002, we conducted mark-recapture experiments (double-marking individuals by toe-clipping as well as by dyeing fur) within a fenced pasture in Touzhijian township, Taibusi Banner, Inner Mongolia. We conducted two field experiments: (1) To induce hoarding and thereby identify the size and composition of each gerbil group, we supplied grain in four petri dishes placed randomly around the central burrow area, and (2) To determine individual social status and judge the location of territorial borders, we placed eleven dishes containing grain along a line that traversed adjoining territories, such that some dishes were within the territory of the subject gerbil group and others required trespassing onto neighboring territories for the subjects to access them. Supplying grain confirmed the existence of four neighboring groups which operated as social units by group hoarding. In our second experiment, gerbils displayed individual differences in both hoarding and chasing behavior within groups. Based on observations of these chases, we identified the dominant gerbils within each group as those individuals most motivated to chase strangers and defend their investments. Resident gerbils had clear priority of access to grain placed in their own territory, and chased other gerbils from these grain stations. We found that territorial borders had an overlap zone of 1-2 m. These experiments provided a straightforward and repeatable method to quantify the complex social behavior of free-ranging Mongolian gerbils.","Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus); Social behavior; Social status; Social structure; Territorial border","caching; rodent; social behavior; social organization; social status; territoriality; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol; World; Gerbillinae; Meriones unguiculatus","Zhong, W.; State Key Lab. of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodent, Institute of Zoology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China; email: zhongwq@ioz.ac.cn",,,10001050,,,,"Chinese","Acta Theriol.

Design and Setting: The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods is a multilevel, longitudinal study of a representative sample of children aged 5 to 11 years in the late 1990s recruited from 80 neighborhoods. A community survey assessing neighborhood social processes was conducted with an independent sample of adult residents in these 80 neighborhoods and is used in conjunction with US census data to assess neighborhood conditions. Participants: A total of 2805 children (18.1% European American, 33.8% African American, and 48.1% Latino) and their primary caregivers were seen twice. Main Outcome Measures: Child Behavior Checklist total raw and clinical cutoff scores for internalizing behavior problems (depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic problems). Results: The percentages of children above the clinical threshold were 21.5%, 18.3%, and 11.5% in neighborhoods of low, medium, and high socioeconomic status, respectively. A substantial proportion of variance in children's total internalizing scores (intraclass correlation, 11.1%) was attributable to between-neighborhood differences. Concentrated disadvantage was associated with more mental health problems and a higher number of children in the clinical range, after accounting for family demographic characteristics, maternal depression, and earlier child mental health scores. Neighborhood collective efficacy and organizational participation were associated with better mental health, after accounting for neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. Collective efficacy mediated the effect of concentrated disadvantage. Conclusions: A large number of children in poor neighborhoods have mental health problems. The mechanism through which neighborhood economic effects operated was community social control and cohesion, which may be amenable to intervention.",,"article; child; child psychiatry; cohort analysis; demography; family size; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; interview; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental disease; neighborhood residence; outcomes research; social status; withdrawal syndrome; Age Factors; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders; Models, Statistical; Personality Inventory; Poverty Areas; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Residence Characteristics; Social Conditions; Social Environment","Xue, Y.; School of Public Health, University of Michigan, M5525 SPH II, 1420 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States; email: yxue@umich.edu",,,0003990X,,ARGPA,"15867109","English","Arch.

Despite the use of farrowing crates, piglet crushing remains a major contributor to pre-weaning piglet mortality, which is typically around 12%. Our aims in this study were to quantify variability between sows and consistency across parities in crushing mortality, and to examine the effect of the environment on variability. In our first study, we compared the variability in crushing mortality in 122 primiparous sows (gilts) that farrowed in crates (71) or open pens (51). Certain sows crushed more or fewer piglets than expected by chance. Crushing was more frequent and more variable in pens compared to crates, indicating that crates may mask differences between sows. In our second study, we recorded piglet mortality for 125 sows, which farrowed in crates over several (4-9) parities. After adjusting for litter size, litter weight and parity effects, consistent individual differences between sows were evident. The repeatability of crushing was estimated at 0.14, with estimates of 0.18 and 0.05 for stillborns and total liveborn mortality, respectively. Although these repeatabilities are relatively low, there was a high degree of phenotypic variance (eg sows crushed between 0 and 30.8% of their piglets). Given that sows show some consistency in piglet mortality over parities, this could be used to inform culling decisions. Additionally, if differences in piglet crushing between sows have a genetic component, a breeding programme might reduce mortality from crushing. Because crates restrict maternal behaviour, genetic selection in this system may have relaxed selection for good maternal behaviour. Selection for reduced piglet mortality, and thus improved maternal abilities, could remove a major obstacle to the wider adoption of less restrictive farrowing systems, with positive welfare consequences for the sow and piglets. © 2005 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.","Animal welfare; Breeding goals; Individual differences; Pre-weaning piglet mortality; Repeatability; Sow","animal behavior; animal housing; animal husbandry; animal welfare; article; body weight; breeding; controlled study; decision making; environment; female; genetic selection; injury; litter size; male; maternal behavior; mortality; multipara; nonhuman; parity; phenotypic variation; pig farming; quantitative analysis; stillbirth; Animalia; Sus scrofa","Javis, S.; Animal Behaviour and Welfare, Sustainable Livestock Systems, Scottish Agricultural College, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, United Kingdom; email: susan.jarvis@sac.ac.uk",,,09627286,,ANWEE,,"English","Anim.

As QoL measures typically require respondents to perform a number of complex language and cognitive processes, there is a valid concern as to whether clients with aphasia can reliably self-report. In this situation, significant others and healthcare providers are called upon to make judgements as proxy respondents. Evidence from medical and chronic disability and health literature suggests that the responses of proxies may be interchangeable with those of patients, however it is not known whether the same is true for language-impaired respondents. Aims: The current research compared scores from aphasic and proxy respondents to investigate whether proxy respondents could be used to obtain reliable information on aphasic people's QoL. Reliable information was considered as statistically similar group comparisons with small effect sizes, and moderate to good agreement between aphasic and proxy respondents' scores. Methods & procedures: A total of 30 aphasic respondents aged 57 to 88 years, and 30 proxy respondents (primarily spouses and children) aged 27 to 82 years were interviewed separately by a speech and language therapist using four QoL measures: a global rating, the Short Form 36 Health Survey, the Dartmouth COOP Charts, and the How I Feel About Myself well-being scale. A systematic cueing procedure was used to facilitate respondents' understanding. Subscale scores were compared for group differences using paired samples t tests and effect size calculations, and individually for agreement using intraclass correlations. Outcomes & results: Proxy respondents demonstrated a significant systematic negative bias in rating their aphasic partners' global QoL, physical functioning, general or overall health, pain, and vitality. Conversely, proxy respondents rated statistically the same as their aphasic partners on physical fitness, feelings, daily activities, quality of life (COOP), total well-being, autonomy, environmental mastery, and purpose in life, with at least moderate agreement. Similar to other literature, there was generally higher agreement for objective domains than subjective domains, and greater agreement on the SF-36 than the global rating measure, the COOP Charts, or the well-being scale. Conclusions: Family members and friends of people with aphasia cannot be interchangeably accepted as reliable informants of their partners' QoL. They rated their partners significantly lower in global and physical health-related QoL, and yet their systematic behaviours in ratings could be useful for clinicians and researchers as their aphasic partners' scores can be easily and confidently predicted. Conversely, they appeared to be reliable informants in other areas, namely feelings, daily activities, and well-being, as well as overall quality of life (when using the illustrated COOP QoL measure), however further research is needed to clarify statistical definitions and interpretations of reliability. Finally, there was no relationship between proxies' and aphasic partners' ratings of social health (functioning, activities, support, relations with others) and self-acceptance. Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of these biases when soliciting information from significant others, and further research is needed to develop QoL measures that are accessible for people with aphasia. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.",,"adult; aged; aphasia; article; awareness; calculation; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; daily life activity; disability; emotion; evidence based medicine; family; female; fitness; friend; functional assessment; health care system; health status; human; human relation; independence; interview; language; male; medical decision making; medical information; medical literature; motivation; outcomes research; pain assessment; physical performance; prediction; quality of life; rating scale; reliability; scoring system; self report; social problem; social status; social support; statistical analysis; validation process; wellbeing","Cruice, M.; Dept. of Lang./Communication Science, City University, Northampton Square, London EC1V 0HB, United Kingdom; email: m.cruice@city.ac.uk",,,02687038,,APHAE,,"English","Aphasiology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-14844347842

We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding, grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for our quantitative genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41% of the variation in activity; 8.60% of the variation was explained by a significant genotype x sex interaction, which signifies genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity explained 11.13% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups within genotype accounted for 19.47% variation in activity, and activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01%), and this is an additional level on which selection could operate: individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution. Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to understand how behaviors evolve. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

After 2, 4, and 6 hours of home observations, 2 raters completed the MBQS and the AMSS on 10 adolescent mothers. The intraclass correlations for interrater reliability of the MBQS and AMSS were .80 and .81, respectively. There was no significant difference in raters' scores among times 1, 2, or 3 for either instrument, implying that perhaps only 2 hours of observation is required. Training times for the MBQS and AMSS were 15 hours and 13 hours, respectively. Completion time for the MBQS averaged 59 minutes compared to 5 minutes for the AMSS. At a pay rate of $12/hour for one rater, completion of 30 visits costs $354 for the MBQS compared to $30 for the AMSS. There was magnitude bias in both instruments such that the lower the sensitivity score, the greater was the difference in ratings. Results suggest that while both tools are equally reliable, the AMSS is the most cost-effective and time-efficient. Agreement among raters leads only to reliability, not validity. Testing needs to be done on a larger sample of adolescents to further evaluate reliability as well as the relative validity of the measures. © 2004 Springer Publishing Company.","Adolescents; Maternal sensitivity; Measurement; Q-sort; Reliability; Validity","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; article; evaluation; feasibility study; female; human; infant; maternal behavior; mother; mother child relation; object relation; observer variation; personality test; psychological aspect; reproducibility; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Maternal Behavior; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Object Attachment; Observer Variation; Q-Sort; Reproducibility of Results; United States","Stiles, A.S.; Texas Women's University, College of Nursing, P.O.

We investigated possible causes and reproductive consequences of inter-individual variation in the migratory behavior of an arctic-nesting species, the greater snow goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus), by radiotracking females at their staging area and on their breeding grounds. Females showed relatively high repeatability in the duration of migration (ri=0.37) and arrival date on the breeding grounds (ri=0.42) suggesting that these traits are characteristics of individuals. Conversely, no individual consistency in departure date from the staging area was detected (ri=-0.02) indicating that environmental factors may have a large influence. Females paired with dominant males departed slightly earlier from the staging area than females accompanied by subordinate males. However, neither social status on the staging area (i.e. paired vs unpaired) nor dominance scores were associated with arrival time of individuals. Finally, the probability of breeding was positively related to arrival date indicating a reproductive cost of arriving too early on the breeding grounds. The combination of breeding probability and seasonal decline in breeding success nonetheless suggests that females arriving a few days earlier than the median arrival date attained highest reproductive success. Our results show that assessing the fitness consequences of early arrival by focusing solely on breeding females would lead to an overestimation of the genuine benefits. This study also indicates possible genetically based differences among individuals in migration duration and arrival time on the breeding grounds. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Arctic; Bird; Dominance; Migration; Repeatability","arrival date; dominance; fitness; individual variation; migratory behavior; reproductive success; waterfowl; Arctic; Arctic and Antarctic; World; Anser; Anser caerulescens; Anser sp.; Atlanticus; Aves; Chen","Bêty, J.; Département de Biologie, Univ. du Que. a Rimouski, 300 Allée des Ursulines, Rimouski, Que.

The model allowed for the fixed effects of age on probability of endorsing the responses and for the random effects of individual differences on the timing of pubertal changes relative to chronological age. In girls, the model was applied three-wave data on twin pairs (N = 414 female monozygotic [MZ] and 197 female dizygotic [DZ] pairs) and female twins from boy-girl pairs (N = 300 twins) from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development. In boys, the data comprised 318 MZ and 185 DZ pairs and 297 male twins from boy-girl pairs. A total of 3172 and 2790 individual twin assessments were available in girls and boys, respectively, spanning ages 8-17 years. The availability of twin data allows the contributions of genes, the shared environment and individual unique environmental experiences to be resolved in the relative timing of pubertal changes. Parameters of the mixed model including fixed effects of age and random effects of genes and environment were estimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations using the BUGS algorithm for Gibbs sampling. The estimated standard deviation of random differences in the timing of puberty relative to age was 0.96 years in girls and 1.01 years in boys. The estimated intraclass correlations for the relative timing of pubertal changes were 0.99 +/-0.01 in MZ girls, 0.52 +/-0.02 in DZ girls, 0.88 +/-0.04 in MZ boys and 0.44+/-0.02 in DZ boys, indicating a very large contribution of genetic factors to the relative timing of pubertal change in both sexes. Additive genetic factors account for an estimated 96.3+/-3.3% of the total variance in random effects in girls and 88.0+/-3.6% in boys. Shared environmental influences account for 3.6+/-3.4% in girls and 0% in boys. In girls, nonshared environmental effects explain 0.1+/-0.1% of the total residual variance.

To study the consistency of individual differences in aggressiveness over time, 112 pigs (eight from each of fourteen litters) were given two R-I tests at each of three ages (46, 80, and 113 days). Pigs were R-I tested singly in an arena within the home pen, where a smaller unfamiliar intruder pig was introduced to a resident pig. Latency to the first attack by the resident was recorded, and the test was stopped as soon as an attack occurred, otherwise the test lasted five minutes. Pigs from eight of the litters used here had been allowed to mix with another litter prior to weaning (days 10-30; socialised), while pigs in six litters remained in littermate groups (control). To determine whether consistency would survive the effects of social disruption, pigs were mixed into new groups on two occasions between the first and second test, then remained in these groups until the third test. Evidence of consistency was found, despite the social disruption. Socialised pigs were more aggressive than controls, females were more aggressive than males, and certain litters were more aggressive than others. After adjusting for these, consistent differences between individuals were still evident. Consistency was higher between the second and third tests compared to the first and second, possibly because of stable group membership or the effects of age or experience. In support of the idea that social experience improves consistency, socialised pigs were more consistent than controls throughout. Evidence of consistent individual differences in aggressive temperament suggests that breeding or changes to early life experiences could have a long-lasting influence on aggressive behaviour in pigs. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Aggression; Aggressive temperament; Consistency; Individual differences; Repeatability",,"D'Eath, R.B.; Animal Behaviour and Welfare, Sustainable Livestock Systems, Scottish Agricultural College, Edinburgh, EH9 3JG, United Kingdom; email: r.death@ed.sac.ac.uk",,,0096140X,,AGBED,,"English","Aggress.

A 27-item standardized decision-support tool [the Childhood Severity of Psychiatric Illness (CSPI)] was used to evaluate the symptoms, risk factors, functioning, comorbidity, and system characteristics. The CSPI has been shown to have a reliability range from 0.70 to 0.80 using intraclass correlations. Logistic regression was used to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of hospitalization, their 95% confidence intervals, and corresponding P values. The results showed that risk factors, symptoms, functioning, comorbidities, and system characteristics were all associated with hospital admissions. Children with a recent suicide attempt, severe danger to others, or history of running away from home/treatment settings were more likely to be hospitalized (respective AOR=12.7, P<.0001; AOR=32.3, P<.0001; AOR=3.0, P=.001). In addition, hospitalization was inversely associated with caregiver knowledge of children (AOR=0.2, P=.01) and multisystem needs (AOR=0.3, P=.04). The decision to hospitalize children psychiatrically appears to be complex. As predicted, risk behaviors and severe symptoms were independent predictors of children's hospital admissions. Interestingly, the capacity of the caregiver and the children's involvement in multiple systems also predict children's hospital admissions. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Implicit in the concept that seasonal clocks reflect adaptations to the local environment is the unexamined assumption that heritable genetic variance exists in the critical features of such clocks, namely, their temporal properties. These experiments quantified the intraspecific variance in, and heritability of, the photorefractoriness interval timer in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), a seasonal clock that provides temporal information to mechanisms that regulate seasonal transitions in body weight. Twenty-seven families consisting of 54 parents and 109 offspring were raised in a long-day photoperiod and transferred as adults to an inhibitory photoperiod (continuous darkness; DD). Weekly body weight measurements permitted specification of the interval of responsiveness to DD, a reflection of the duration of the interval timer, in each individual. Body weights of males and females decreased after exposure to DD, but 3 to 5 months later, somatic recrudescence occurred, indicative of photorefractoriness to DD. The interval timer was approximately 5 weeks longer and twice as variable in females relative to males. Analyses of variance of full siblings revealed an overall intraclass correlation of 0.71 ± 0.04 (0.51 ± 0.10 for male offspring and 0.80 ± 0.06 for female offspring), suggesting a significant family resemblance in the duration of interval timers. Parent-offspring regression analyses yielded an overall heritability estimate of 0.61 ± 0.2; h2 estimates from parent-offspring regression analyses were significant for female offspring (0.91 ± 0.4) but not for male offspring (0.35 ± 0.2), indicating strong additive genetic components for this trait, primarily in females. In nature, individual differences, both within and between sexes, in the timekeeping properties of seasonal interval timers, and a strong heritable basis thereof, would provide ample substrate for selection to rapidly influence seasonal clocks. Balancing selection in environments where the onset of spring conditions varies from year to year could maintain genetic variance in interval timers and yield interval timers tuned to the local environment.","Heritability; Phodopus sungorus; Photoperiodism; Photorefractoriness","animal experiment; anticipation; article; behavior; body weight; child parent relation; circannual rhythm; darkness; environment; female; genetic analysis; genetic variability; heritability; male; metabolism; nonhuman; Phodopus; photoperiodicity; priority journal; regression analysis; reproduction; seasonal variation; sex difference; Animals; Body Weight; Cricetinae; Darkness; Female; Male; Phodopus; Seasons; Sex Factors; Animalia; Cricetinae; Phodopus; Phodopus sungorus","Prendergast, B.J.; University of Chicago, Institute for Mind and Biology, 940 E. 57th St., Chicago, IL 60637, United States; email: prendergast@uchicago.edu",,,07487304,,JBRHE,"15245649","English","J.

Information concerning birth weight and gestational age was collected from birth records. All infants were tested using Bayley Scales of Mental and Psychomotor Development. The infant's working memory (WM) was tested during A-not-B task performance, which was shown to depend on the maturity of the prefrontal cortex. The behavioral data were analyzed off-line using videotape records. The one-way ANOVA revealed that the AB performance improves with age. A highly significant improvement of the ability to tolerate the delay in A-not-B task was observed between 9 and 10 months of life. There was no longitudinal stability in individual infant performance of A-not-B across the period of 7-12 months of age. The AB delay was significantly correlated with psychomotor and mental development only after the crucial period of the rapid increase in the AB delay (9-10 months). The analysis of intraclass mono- and dizygotic correlations showed that individual differences in the WM (tolerance to AB delay) at 7-9 months and at 10-12 months are of different nature. There was a significant effect of shared environment on AB delay variance in 10-12-month-old group, whereas down to this age no systematic influence on individual variability was observed.

Different personality traits are phenotypically correlated, and heritabilities of personality traits have been reported in humans and various animals. In great tits, consistent heritable differences have been found in relation to exploration, which is correlated with various other personality traits. In this paper, we investigate whether or not risk-taking behaviour is part of these avian personalities. We found that (i) risk-taking behaviour is repeatable and correlated with exploratory behaviour in wild-caught hand-reared birds, (ii) in a bi-directional selection experiment on 'fast' and 'slow' early exploratory behaviour, bird lines tend to differ in risk-taking behaviour, and (iii) within-nest variation of risk-taking behaviour is smaller than between-nest variation. To show that risk-taking behaviour has a genetic component in a natural bird population, we bred great tits in the laboratory and artificially selected 'high' and 'low' risk-taking behaviour for two generations. Here, we report a realized heritability of 19.3 ± 3.3% (s.e.m.) for risk-taking behaviour. With these results we show in several ways that risk-taking behaviour is linked to exploratory behaviour, and we therefore have evidence for the existence of avian personalities. Moreover, we prove that there is heritable variation in more than one correlated personality trait in a natural population, which demonstrates the potential for correlated evolution.","Approach-avoidance; Parus major; Personality; Risk-taking behaviour; Selection response; Temperament","behavior; exploration; heritability; passerine; risk; analysis of variance; animal; animal behavior; appetite; article; bird; breeding; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; evolution; experiment; exploratory behavior; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic selection; genetics; heritability; laboratory; Netherlands; nonhuman; personality; physiology; population research; priority journal; quantitative trait; rearing; risk; songbird; startle reflex; Animalia; Aves; Parus; Parus major; Parus major; Passeri; Passeriformes","Van Oers, K.; Netherlands Institute of Ecology, PO Box 40, 6666 ZG, Heteren, Netherlands; email: k.vanoers@nioo.knaw.nl",,"Royal Society",09628452,,PRLBA,,"English","Proc.

Subtle individually distinctive differences in push-up characteristics have been suggested to play a role in the recognition of social partners. However, if the structure of push-ups is responsive to changing physiological states then their capacity to promote recognition may be limited. The current study evaluated whether the push-ups performed while in an experimentally imposed state of fatigue by male side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), retain the individually distinctive characteristics apparent in rested lizards. We found repeatable among-individual differences in the duration and the relative height of push-up components. Repeatability values did not change consistently between the rested and fatigued conditions, nor when both conditions were pooled, indicating that these push-up characteristics do not change with fatigue. Similarly, discriminant functions that were generated using push-ups from one state assigned push-ups performed in an alternate state to the correct individuals. Furthermore, when analyzed independently of individual identity, the values of display parameters examined in the current study did not change significantly between states, and discriminant function analysis could not reliably classify push-ups to the correct state. Taken together the results show that individually distinctive push-up characteristics are robust to effects of fatigue, consistent with their suggested role in social recognition. In the future, video playback experiments can test whether lizards utilize the signature-like characteristics of push-ups to discriminate among individuals.","Individual recognition; Lizard; Push-up display; Uta stansburiana; Visual communication","body condition; display behavior; lizard; recognition; Amphibia; Iguania; Reptilia; Squamata; Uta; Uta stansburiana","Brandt, Y.; Biology Department, Ctr.

Individual differences in the magnitude of these effects (i.e., nicotine sensitivity) are of interest to many researchers, such as those examining vulnerability to dependence and processes related to chronic tolerance. However, such characterization of individual differences depends on the consistency of the observed responses, and the consistency of acute effects of nicotine in humans has not been studied systematically. We examined the consistency of the acute effects of the same dose of nicotine administered by nasal spray across multiple drug administration trials, within as well as between sessions. Subjective (i.e., self-reported effects), cardiovascular, and performance measures were assessed following each of four dosing trials of nicotine (20 μg/kg) on three sessions and of placebo on one session. For those measures in which the main effect of nicotine vs. placebo was significant, intraclass correlations were calculated for different sets of trials across different numbers of sessions. Our objective was to determine whether the consistency of responses declined when those responses were based on smaller numbers of trials or sessions, in an effort to guide future research in this area. Results indicated that the consistency of nicotine effects is generally high, even across trials within just one session. Additional research is needed to determine the generalizability of these findings to other methods of nicotine administration, including smoking, and to clarify the extent to which this consistency reflects characteristic consistency of the pharmacological actions of nicotine per se vs. consistency of nonspecific responses to the drug administration procedure.",,"nicotine; nose spray; placebo; adult; analysis of variance; article; cardiovascular effect; clinical research; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; dizziness; dose response; fatigue; female; heart rate; human; male; methodology; mood; nervousness; priority journal; self report; sensitivity analysis; smoking; substance abuse; systolic blood pressure; task performance; tobacco dependence; visual analog scale; Administration, Intranasal; Adult; Affect; Cardiovascular System; Female; Ganglionic Stimulants; Humans; Male; Nicotine; Placebos; Reproducibility of Results; Task Performance and Analysis; Tobacco Use Disorder","Perkins, K.A.; Western Psychiatric Institute/Clinic, Univ. of Pittsburgh School of Med., 3811 O'Harra Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States; email: perkinska@msx.upmc.edu",,,14622203,,NTREF,"14668071","English","Nicotine Tob.

FA deals with small differences around the symmetry value of zero. Thus, measurement error is often relatively large. However, repeated measurements and large sample sizes allow reliable estimates of FA that can be corrected for errors. The purpose of this study was two-fold: at the biological level, we examined with a large sample size (N = 804) whether pedipalp FA could be used as a short-cut measure of individual quality in the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. This was done by estimating how strongly FA correlates with male sexual performance, i.e. drumming rate and mobility. At the statistical level, we examined how the deflating effect of measurement error could be eliminated to get unbiased correlations between FA and any repeatable trait. We also examined which is the more economical way to get accurate population-level estimates of FA-trait associations, to increase sample size or the number of within-subject repeats. Our results show that there was a very weak, but significant negative relationship between pedipalp FA and mobility (Kendall's partial rk = -0.086). However, this value inevitably underestimates the true relationship, given the large measurement error. It is possible to estimate the unbiased relationship by correcting the above correlation coefficient with effective reliability estimates of both FA and sexual performance. After the correction, the unbiased relationship between FA and mobility was r = -0.183. Our results indicate that FA is weakly related to male sexual performance in H. rubrofasciata. Our results also show that leptokurtosis, which is characteristic of signed FA distributions, was entirely caused by 17 outlier individuals. This indicates that large sample sizes are important to illustrate the true between-individual heterogeneity in FA. Furthermore, our power analysis indicates that it pays to measure more individuals than to increase the number of within-subject repeats to obtain accurate population-level estimates of FA-trait associations.",,"fluctuating asymmetry; male behavior; morphology; sexual behavior; spider; Araneae; Canis; Lycosidae","Ahtiainen, J.J.; University of Jyväskylä, Dept. of Biol./Environmental Science, P.O.

Here, I consider several emerging areas of research in the interface between behaviour and development, with a focus on behavioural processes that are likely to affect the development and maintenance of interindividual variation in a wide array of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. Using a norm of reaction approach, I introduce and illustrate the complexities of phenotypic development. Next, I consider the implications of environmental selection and niche construction for phenotypic development, and consider why these behavioural processes are likely to encourage the development and maintenance of repeatable, stable individual differences and trait syndromes. Parental effects involving behaviour also affect the development of a wide array of phenotypic traits; differential allocation is a currently underappreciated type of parental effect, by which males can affect the development of their offspring via nongenetic means, even if those males have no contact with their young. Behavioural parental effects also contribute to extragenetic inheritance, and recent studies suggest that this phenomenon may be more widespread than previously suspected. The effects of behavioural processes on phenotypic development have interesting implications for problems in related disciplines (e.g. ecology, evolution and conservation biology), providing additional impetus for future research on the effects of behavioural mechanisms on the development of behavioural and other traits. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,"behavior; developmental biology; phenotype","Stamps, J.; Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: jastamps@ucdavis.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

An earlier experiment indicated that reactions to humans and novelty had some repeatability between the ages of 8 and 24 weeks, thus reflecting personality traits. The present experiment therefore tested for predicted negative relationships between behaviour related to fear and anxiety measured at 8 weeks of age and later reproduction in 30 sows. Factor analysis of behaviour in a voluntary human approach test performed in the home cage and a novel object test performed in a novel arena indicated that behavioural measures related to investigation of these stimuli loaded on separate factors and may therefore reflect independent underlying dimensions. One factor related to investigation of the human was interpreted as reflecting the level of fear of humans, while another was correlated to investigation of the novel object and interpreted as indicating novelty-induced anxiety. Factor scores were generated for 'fear' and 'anxiety' and used in regression analysis as predictors of maternal behaviour and reproductive parameters. Higher levels of fear of humans were associated with longer durations of farrowing, larger variation in inter-birth intervals, and a higher number of piglets dying without milk in their stomachs. The duration of farrowing was positively correlated to the number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. Higher fear also tended to associate with a higher number of stillborn and a higher number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. High anxiety only tended to be associated with a higher number of stillborn. These results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that there are negative associations between fear of humans and maternal ability in sows. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The repeatability of answers, 180 questionnaires being sent again after a six week interval, was assessed by two methods: by the percentages of agreement and using the Kappa index. We evaluated 61 questions, which were divided into five sections (general questions, questions on employment, lifestyle, health, and personality). The agreement rate varied from 46% to 100% and the value of the Kappa index from -0.01 to 1. The agreement performed by the Kappa index was divided into 4 groups (≤0.4 - poor; 0.41-0.6 - average; 0.61-0.80- good; 0.81-1 almost perfect). The agreement across our questionnaire was poor in 6.6% of the questions, average - in 31.1%, good - in 45.9% and almost perfect - in 16.4% of the questions. Next we divided the questions by their content into two groups - the factual questions (group 1) and questions where answers contain an evaluative or motivational element (group 2). Significant differences (p<0.001) were found between groups 1 and 2 in the agreement (86.8%; 72.1%) and the Kappa index (0.73; 0.48). In questions where agreement of answers is evaluated as average or even weak we used three types of solution: a) substitution by the analogous questions with a higher agreement, b) aggregation of the answers if possible, or c) the questions were not used for the analyses.

Parental quality also has often been invoked as a key element in mate choice among biparental species, and many sexually-selected traits have been investigated as potential predictors of parental quality. In recent studies of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) parents, we found that individuals behaved remarkably consistently across time, regardless of temporary manipulations of the nestling provisioning of their partners. This suggests that variation in parental competence may be attributable to quality differences among individuals. One prediction of the 'parental quality differences' hypothesis is that individuals also should show consistency in their provisioning behavior across broods. To test this, we compared the parental delivery rates of individual house sparrows across broods. Parents of both sexes reduced their per-chick delivery rates as the season progressed; parents of both sexes were also responsive to changes in their brood sizes. Despite these sources of environmental variation in provisioning rates, the parental care of individual males was highly repeatable across broods. By contrast, female parental care showed extremely low repeatability, and standardized measures of among-individual variation in parental behavior revealed females to be much less variable than males. These results indicate that females in this multi-brooded species have much to gain from mate-choice decisions predicated on male parental quality or accurate indicators of such, whereas males are less likely to profit from being highly selective about the 'parental quality' of their partners.",,"food provisioning; mate choice; parental care; passerine; Aves; Galliformes; Gallus gallus; Passer; Passer domesticus; Passeridae; Passeriformes","Schwagmeyer, P.L.; Department of Zoology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, United States; email: plsch@ou.edu",,,01791613,,ETHOE,,"English","Ethology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038066453

According to this hypothesis, animals can be characterised by consistency in responses across social and non-social situations as well as over time. We evaluated the validity of this hypothesis for predicting the coping responses of pigs by testing for predicted correlations between responses to a variety of challenges. Animals were exposed to an immobility test at 3 weeks of age. At 8 and 24 weeks, animals were exposed to an unknown pig in the test animal's home cage, a human in the home cage, and a novel object (bucket) in a novel arena. None of the predicted correlations were found between the duration of immobility and behaviour in the later tests. Many behavioural measures had some repeatability between the ages of 8 and 24 weeks, despite significant changes in the observed level of responses, but there were few correlations between responses to social and non-social situations. Responses to a human and novel object were positively correlated when measured at 8 weeks but not at 24 weeks. The results indicate that the coping styles hypothesis has very limited value in predicting the coping responses of pigs representing the population as a whole. The existing correlations could more parsimoniously be described as reflecting responses to specific or closely related stimuli. It is suggested that future research on pig personality should investigate the possibility that specific coping behaviours - for example, those mediated by fear and anxiety - may have consequences for different elements of coping ability related to welfare and productivity. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Of 45 paired t-tests, 29% resulted in significant differences between individual observer estimates and between individual observer estimates and the 2 other methods.

Methods: The NEO-Five Factor Inventory was evaluated within the context of the Lower Extremity Assessment Project, a prospective study of patients with severe lower extremity trauma admitted to eight level I trauma centers. Patients/Participants: The NEO-FFI was administered to 557 adults and 416 of their significant others. At 2 years postinjury, the NEO-FFI was readministered to 396 patients. Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures were as follows: (a) agreement between patient and significant other scores; (b) stability of personality traits over two years; and (c) the relationship of the measured NEO-FFI traits with patient characteristics and health habits. Results: There was fair to moderate agreement between assessments of personality provided by the patients themselves and their significant others, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.44 to 0.54 for the different domains of personality. Patient assessments on the NEO-FFI were found to be robust with no significant changes in four of the five personality domains at 2 years postinjury. We also found that personality traits of patients are related to patient characteristics and behaviors in the directions that were expected. Conclusions: The NEO-FFI is a brief, valid, and stable measure of underlying personality traits that is practical for use in a trauma setting. Its use in both outcomes research and patient evaluation should be encouraged. In cases in which patients cannot complete the test, evaluations by significant others may be useful.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; female; human; leg injury; male; outcomes research; personality test; priority journal; prospective study; validation process; Adolescent; Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Personality Inventory; Prospective Studies; Wounds and Injuries","MacKenzie, E.J.; Johns Hopkins Ctr.

Individuals can be identified as showing either active (pro-active) or passive (re-active) responses to a variety of challenges, and these are often referred to as 'coping styles'. Although most studied in rodents, coping styles are found in a variety of vertebrate species. In rodents, the resident-intruder aggressiveness test is a key measure of coping style, whereas in pigs, several recent studies have used a 'backtest' as the key measure of coping: A piglet is held on its back for one minute and the frequency of struggling bouts ('escape attempts') is recorded. In this study, we compared pig behaviour in backtests performed on 3 and 9 days of age, with aggressiveness was measured using 2 resident-intruder tests between 16 and 19 days post-weaning. A smaller unfamiliar intruder was introduced into part of the resident pig's home pen, and resident attack latency was recorded. Struggling bout frequency in the backtests showed a unimodal distribution. Data were analysed both as a continuous distribution and by comparing only the piglets from either extreme of the distribution (for comparison with other studies, top and bottom 25%). There was good repeatability of outcome (struggling frequency) over the two backtests, and over the two resident-intruder tests (attack latency and occurrence of resident attacks). However, no relationship was found between behaviour in the backtests and aggression in the resident-intruder tests, despite exhaustive analysis. Other authors have found that pigs show consistent responses to challenges, suggesting a degree of stable temperament. In line with the present findings though, most found no correlation between social and non-social responses. Other published experiments show that in pigs, the backtest can predict several physiological differences characteristic of coping styles. However, the present study shows that in pigs, aggressiveness and struggling in a backtest are not correlated, suggesting that they do not represent different expressions of the same underlying 'coping' trait.",,,"D'Eath, R.B.; Anim.

The concept of repeatability, the measurement of consistent individual differences, has become an increasingly important tool in evolutionary and ecological physiology. Significant repeatability facilitates the study of selection acting on natural populations and the concept has several practical implications for identifying traits. 2. When properly defined and measured, repeatability can set the upper limit to heritability. This is potentially a very useful interpretation of the repeatability of traits measured on natural populations because often, estimates of heritability cannot be obtained. Many recent reports of repeatability of individual differences for traits have made this interpretation. 3. However, repeatability estimates may not set an upper limit to heritability if: (a) measured traits are not genetically identical, (b) common environmental effects work in opposition to direct genetic effects, (c) the temporary environments for each trait are negatively correlated, (d) significant genotype-environment interaction is present, or (e) the traits are influenced by maternal effects. 4. The quantitative genetic theory that defines the concept of repeatability is reviewed and implications of violations of the five assumptions are discussed in the context of interpreting repeatability as an upper estimate to heritability.","Behaviour; Common environmental effects; Genotype-environment interaction; Maternal effects; Performance measures","genotype-environment interaction; heritability; life history trait; measurement method; performance assessment; physiology","Dohm, M.R.; Department of Biology, University of Hawaii, 200 W.

In the first parity the gilts were either housed in a crate or a ""get-away-pen"" (GAP) and in the second parity either the same farrowing environment was used again or the sow was housed in the alternative system. The behaviour was compared with the behavioural reaction pattern of the same individuals in prepubertal tests (open field test, human-test, food competition test) and the reactivity in the HPA-axis during the open field test. Nest building behaviour was in both parities found to be more elaborated in the GAPs, where the prepartum rooting period started significantly sooner (32.5 ± 3.0 h versus 41.3 ± 3.0 h, F1,27 = 5.72; P &lt; 0.05 and 27.4 ± 3.3 h versus 35.6 ± 3.1 h, F1,27 = 4.33; P &lt; 0.05, respectively) and had a longer duration (21.5 ± 3.1 h versus 32.6 ± 3.1 h, F1,27 = 8.33; P &lt; 0.01 and 27.9 ± 3.6 versus 38.7 ± 3.4 h, F1,27 = 6.57; P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Farrowing behaviour was in the first parity strongly dependent upon the environment, e.g. the mean piglet birth interval was significantly longer in the crates (30 ± 4 min versus 19 ± 3 min, F1,21 = 5.55; P &lt; 0.05), indicating an increased environmental sensitivity in gilts as compared to the second parity sows, where no environmental effect was found. Both farrowing and nest building behaviour, especially in the first parity, was connected to the prepubertal behavioural and physiological reaction pattern (1st parity - immobility in human-test ∼ activity during farrowing: rs = -0.49; P &lt; 0.01, N = 38 and the quantity of postural changes in nest building period ∼ rise in cortisol during open field test: rs = 0.44; P &lt; 0.01, N = 35). Furthermore, there was a strong repeatability across parities in parameters describing activity during nest building and farrowing. The prepubertal gilts reacting behaviourally calm in a stressful situation were timing their nest building more optimally than the more actively responding individuals. Behavioural activity during prepubertal tests was also correlated with being active during farrowing. We therefore conclude that behaviour during nest building and farrowing is related to the general reaction pattern during stress, especially in inexperienced gilts, and that the performance reflects an innate pattern of reaction in the individual, that can be modified by the environment and previous experience. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Criterion validity is evaluated by examining the relation between AgC and behavior. Rorschach and clinical chart material taken from psychological assessments were examined for 94 patients in Exner's (1993) psychiatric reference groups. An Aggression Chart Rating Scale (ACRS) was created to score the level of aggressiveness of each patient's diagnostic report. Analyses revealed good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .73) for ACRS scores and Aggressive Movement (AG; κ = .73) and excellent reliability for AgC (κ = .88) and Morbid Content (MOR; κ =.79). Pearson's correlation revealed significant relations between AgC and both AG and MOR. All 3 Rorschach variables were significantly related to scores on the ACRS. A stepwise regression analysis utilizing these 3 variables resulted in AgC being the only nonredundant predictor of scores on the ACRS. This suggests that AgC was more strongly related to more aggressive ACRS scores than either AG or MOR.

The occurrence of such foraging area fidelity has been little studied, particularly for pelagic species. We used satellite telemetry to study foraging behaviour and foraging area fidelity of individual chick-rearing gannets in the North Sea (at the Bass Rock, SE Scotland) and in the Celtic Sea (at Great Saltee, SE Ireland), 2 areas that differ in the distribution of prey. Foraging ranges of adults covered a wide area of ocean up to a maximum range of 540 km at the Bass Rock and 240 km at Great Saltee. At the Bass Rock, individual birds foraged in a single direction or at most in 2 distinct directions, with very similar bearings on successive trips in each direction, significant differences in bearings between individuals and significant repeatability in distances travelled. These results strongly suggest that individuals learned and remembered the locations of feeding sites and used that knowledge on subsequent foraging trips. By contrast at Great Saltee, bearings of successive trips by individuals were much less similar, with highly variable distances to destinations, no differences in bearings among individuals and no significant repeatability in distance travelled. These results indicate a much lower degree of foraging area fidelity at Great Saltee, probably due to a more uniform or less predictable distribution of prey in the Celtic Sea than in the North Sea. Despite marked differences between colonies in distances to trip destinations, durations of foraging trips and foraging area fidelity, the behaviour of birds during foraging trips was very Similar at the 2 sites: the average speed of travel during foraging trips was almost identical and birds at both colonies spent about half their time at sea in flight.","Foraging behaviour; Information transfer; Marine distribution; Pelecaniformes; Satellite telemetry","foraging behavior; memory; seabird; site fidelity; telemetry; Celtic Sea; North Sea; Aves; Morus bassanus; Morus bassanus; Pelecaniformes; Sulidae","Hamer, K.C.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; email: k.c.hamer@durham.ac.uk",,"Inter-Research",01718630,,MESED,,"English","Mar.

Although perfumes are obviously involved in sexual communication, the significance of great individual differences in preference for fragrances is an evolutionary puzzle. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic and conserved set of genes that plays an important role in immune function in vertebrates. Both mice and humans have been shown to prefer the body odor of potential partners that have a dissimilar MHC genotype, which would result in heterozygous offspring. We tested whether individual preferences for perfume ingredients correlate with a person's MHC genotype. The human MHC is called HLA (human leukocyte antigen). A total of 137 male and female students who had been typed for their MHC (HLA-A, -B, -DR) scored 36 scents in a first test for use on self (""Would you like to smell like that yourself?"") and a subset of 18 scents 2 years later either for use on self or for a potential partner (""Would you like your partner to smell like that?""). An overall analysis showed a significant correlation between the MHC and the scorings of the scents ""for self"" in both tests. In a detailed analysis we found a significant interaction of the two most common HLAs with the rating of the 36 scents in the first study as well as with the 18 scents in the second study when evaluated for self. This result suggests that persons who share, for example, HLA-A2, have a similar preference for any of the perfume ingredients. The significant repeatability of these preferences in the two tests showed that the volunteers that had either HLA-A1 or HLA-A2 were significantly consistent in their preferences for the perfume ingredients offered. Hardly any significant correlation between MHC genotype and ratings of the scents ""for partner"" were found. This agrees with the hypothesis that perfumes are selected ""for self"" to amplify in some way body odors that reveal a person's immunogenetics.","HLA type; Immunogenetics; Major histocompatibility complex (MHC); Perfume; Scent preference; Sexual communication","behavioral ecology; odor","Milinski, M.; Max Planck Institute for Limnology, Department of Evolutionary Ecology, August-Thienemann-Strasse 2, D-24306 Ploen, Germany; email: milinski@mpil-ploen.mpg.de",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

Furthermore, there were positive associations between metabolic rate, aggression, and competitive ability that were also repeatable over time. However, there was no relationship between competitive ability (measured as feeding attempts) and subsequent growth.

Male North American bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, display this form of discrimination based on individual variation in advertisement calls. In this study, we investigated the acoustic basis of neighbour-stranger discrimination to determine how individual identity might be encoded by particular properties of bullfrog advertisement calls. We analysed patterns of within-male and between-male variability in 1078 bullfrog advertisement calls recorded from 27 territorial males. All call properties that we examined varied significantly among males. However, fundamental frequency and dominant frequency showed the lowest within-male variation and the highest repeatability between two recording sessions, and both properties were highly correlated with the first canonical root from discriminant function analyses, which typically accounted for 70-80% of the variability between males.

Method: Using the TLFB method, 34 clients (26 men) who had attended at least one session of an outpatient alcohol treatment program reported on treatment contacts, including any supplemental services (e.g., psychiatric care). TLFB reports of help seeking at that agency were compared with agency records of treatment contacts. Results: Clients reported on their help-seeking behavior for a period of approximately 8 months after they had completed an initial assessment for the outpatient treatment. With regard to the number of outpatient sessions they attended, intraclass correlations and equivalence testing showed that the TLFB data were comparable to the agency records of treatment contacts. Analysis of week-to-week correspondence of the presence or absence of help-seeking episodes showed good agreement between TLFB and the agency records for most participants, although there was substantial variation. Degree of correspondence was not associated with the length of the recall period or individual differences (e.g., drinking pattern). Older participants, however, tended to have lower week-to-week concordance than did younger participants. Conclusions: These data provide preliminary support for the utility of a help-seeking TLFB instrument to assess addiction- and mental health-related contacts. This instrument may be especially useful in research in which collecting temporal patterns of help seeking is of interest (e.g., in studies examining factors influencing the delay in help seeking after relapse).",,"adult; alcoholism; article; drinking behavior; female; health behavior; health program; human; male; mental health care; outpatient","Breslin, F.C.; Institute for Work and Health, 250 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Ont.

In both samples, these 3 groups showed equivalent levels of reliability and validity as measured by: contingency coefficients for the 20 INC item responses across occasions; test - retest intraclass correlations of NEO - PI - R domain scores; convergent correlations with Goldberg's (1992) Bipolar Adjective Scale scores; and discriminant correlations between the 5 NEO - PI - R domain scores.

Since the original publication, one item was deleted and two items were merged, leaving 24 items. In an additional change, severity scales were added to the frequency scales. In this paper, psychometric properties and (relative) norms for the new SBS are presented. In the psychometric study, 45 adults with mental retardation from a residential facility participated. Of these, 15 were selected for high-rates or very severe forms of stereotyped behaviors, 15 for mild to moderate rates or less severe stereotypies, and 15 for the low rates or absence of stereotyped behaviors. Direct care staff familiar with the participants completed the SBS and the 'Stereotypy' subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Residential (ABC-R) (Aman, Singh, Stewart and Field, 1985). For 15 participants, two raters independently completed the SBS. In addition, 45-min direct behavior observations were conducted on 16 participants. After approximately four weeks, the instruments were completed a second time by the same raters. As for reliability, the SBS frequency and severity scale total scores yielded test-retest intraclass coefficients (ICC) of 0.93 and 0.71, ICC interrater agreement of 0.76 and 0.75, and each had an internal consistency α of 0.91. For criterion validity, the SBS frequency and severity scores correlated with the ABC-R 'Stereotypy' score at 0.80 and 0.84 (Pearson r), with systematic behavior observations at 0.50 and 0.65 (Pearson r), and with the a priori classification at 0.50 and 0.65 (Spearman ρ). From a previous data set of 550 individuals with stereotypic behavior, normative data (percentile ranks and T-scores) were derived.

Behavioural genetic studies of later life are strictly limited. We carried out a community-based pilot study of sibling resemblance with the primary aims of establishing the feasibility of such work in this population and estimating genetic influence on depression and its risk factors. Methodology. Data were collected on surviving siblings of individuals interviewed in previous phases of an epidemiological study of the elderly (the Gospel Oak survey); scales relevant to the investigation of late life depression and its risk factors were utilized. Since families tend to be geographically scattered, the interview was conducted by telephone. Comparisons were made between data relating to the siblings and those obtained on the probands. Variability in phenotypic traits and environmental measures was partitioned into between- and within-family variation, in order to distinguish familial and non-familial sources of variation. Intraclass correlations were used to estimate the strength of genetic influences on continuous measures, while pairwise concordances were calculated for dichotomous traits. Results. Thirty-two siblings from 20 families were ultimately identified and interviewed. Intraclass correlations for the Depression and Dementia Diagnostic Scales and the Handicap Scale were 0, 0.27 and 0.22, respectively. Those for number of life events, number of friends in contact and number of neighbours in contact were 0.08, 0.03 and 0, respectively. Concordance for both depression caseness and dementia caseness was 0. Discussion. There were difficulties carrying out this study, which are discussed. The study is the first of its kind to examine familial resemblance for the common disorders of old age. Establishing ways of engaging elderly families with research will be a challenge that future research will need to meet.

However, parent rating measures produce unusual patterns of results. Intraclass correlations for identical (MZ) twins are typically high, whereas fraternal (DZ) twin intraclass correlations are much lower than would be predicted from an additive genetic model. The 'too low' DZ correlations can be explained by parent-rating biases that either exaggerate the differences between DZ twins (contrast effects) or that inflate the similarity of MZ twins (assimilation effects), or by the presence of non-additive genetic variance. To evaluate the three possible explanations, we used model-fitting procedures applied to parent-rating data averaged across 14, 20, 24, and 36 months of age in a sample of 196 twin pairs participating in the MacArthur Longitudinal Twin Study. The data were best described by a model that included contrast effects.

But males attempt to attract females even when they have no carrion. We examined the factors that influence male behavior directed toward finding or attracting mates in both field-caught and laboratory-reared Nicrophorus orbicollis, a North American burying beetle. We investigated whether male behavior differed based on both intrinsic (size) and extrinsic (resources held) differences among males. Further, we examined repeatability of individual behaviors and the effect of holding or lacking resources on these repeatabilities. Field-caught and laboratory-reared individuals differed in overall activity but not in their behavioral repertoire, making studies of laboratory-reared males relevant. The behavior of individual males was very consistent within a condition, but plastic between resource conditions. The frequency of calling (adopting a posture that indicates pheromone release to attract females) depended on male size when males did not hold resources, but this relationship disappeared when males held resources. Without carrion, smaller males called more frequently than did larger males. When holding carrion, smaller males reduced their calling, whereas larger males significantly increased the frequency with which they attempted to attract females and reduced the amount of time they spent searching. Thus, calling behavior of males was conditional on not only intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but also an interaction between them. We suggest that the changes in calling represent alternative tactics based on the costs and benefits of attracting both potential mates and competitors, which differ for males of different sizes.","Body size; Burying beetles; Male-male competition; Nicrophorus orbicollis; Pheromone; Repeatabilities; Resource defense","beetle; calling behavior; carrion; male behavior; mate attraction; mating behavior; pheromone; resource availability; size effect; Coleoptera; Nicrophorus americanus; Nicrophorus orbicollis; Silphidae; Vertebrata","Rauter, C.M.; S-225 Agricultural Sci.

Behavioral and steady state evoked potential thresholds were established in each case. Where possible, otoacoustic emission and speech perception results (unaided and aided) also were obtained. Results: One in 433 (0.23%) of the children in our series had evidence of auditory neuropathy.

Approximately half of the subjects showed little understanding, or even awareness, of speech inputs in both the unaided and aided conditions. There were, however, a number of children who could score at significant levels on speech discrimination tasks and who benefited from the provision of amplification. Conclusion: The results suggest that auditory neuropathy is more common in the infant population than previously suspected.

Exercise capacity ultimately constrains behaviour, and therefore may influence social interactions. The hypothesis was tested that individual differences in maximal rates of oxygen consumption (V̇(o2max) - a primary determinant of sustainable exercise capacity - affect dominance hierarchies in experimental all-female flocks of the highly social Red Jungle FowL (Gallus gallus). It was also examined whether social rank could in turn influence V̇(o2max) (which is quite plastic in most vertebrates), and whether these relationships were influenced by a common and relative benign parasite, the intestinal nematode Ascaridia galli. 2. Substantial between-individual Variation was found in V̇(o2max) that was significantly repeatable over time, but there was no indication that V̇(o2max) was affected by A. galli infection. Stable social hierarchies were quickly established in 26 of 28 experimental flocks (each contained three females previously isolated from each other). Infection status affected social rank, but there was no consistent pattern between rank and infection. 3.

The extent and expression of these differences can limit the power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different environments or within a single environment; little is known about how repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To address this issue; we examined the consistency of antipredator behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field (15, 22.5, 30°C). Temperature had substantial effects on the average expression of each behaviour; snakes crawled more slowly, for shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures. Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this consistency of expression was not affected by temperature.",,"antipredator defense; temperature effect; Serpentes; Thamnophis; Thamnophis ordinoides; Thamnophis ordinoides","Brodie III, E.D.; Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405-6801, United States; email: edb3@bio.indiana.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

Snails displayed consistent, individually repeatable responses to the predation cues, including hiding (refuge use) and substratum avoidance (crawling to the water surface or out of the water). We assessed shell morphology using morphometric techniques that isolate geometrically independent components of size and shape variation corresponding to aperture width and apertural obstruction. Previous studies indicate that large size, narrow apertures and obstructed apertures reduce morphological vulnerability to the shell-entry predation tactics used by crayfish. In the present study, small, and thus more vulnerable, prey tended to show stronger antipredator behaviour than large prey (i.e. behavioural compensation for morphological vulnerability). In contrast, behavioural and shape-based defences were positively correlated; snails with narrow apertures showed strong antipredator responses. We refer to this 'double defence' against predators as cospecialization. With either compensation or cospecialization, suites of correlated behavioural or morphological traits must be studied in tandem to understand the adaptive value of prey responses to predators.",,"antipredator defense; compensation; freshwater; morphology; snail; Astacoidea; Basommatophora; Gastropoda; Mollusca; Orconectes rusticus; Orconectes rusticus; Physa gyrina; Physa gyrina","Dewitt, T.J.; Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries Sci., Texas A and M University, College Station, TX 77843-2258, United States; email: tdewitt@wfscgate.tamu.edu",,"Academic Press",00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We estimated the reliability and validity of a standardized method of cross-institutional assessment of the behavior of individual rhinoceros. In 1994 and 1995, we asked zookeepers at 19 zoos to rate their black rhinoceros (a total of 60 animals) on 52 behavior elements using a questionnaire. At 14 zoos, at least two keepers rated all the black rhinoceros at their zoo. We used average differences in their ratings of the 52 behavior elements to determine the most reliably rated behavior elements. Fourteen elements were retained for further analysis. Based on their inter-correlations, we grouped these 14 behaviors into six behavior traits: olfactory behaviors, chasing/stereotypy/mouthing, friendly to keeper, fearful, patrolling and dominant (to conspecifics). A behavior profile of each animal consisted of scores on these six traits that were the sum of the primary keeper's ratings for each element in the group. To test the validity of these profiles, we compared scores on the six traits to the behavior of each rhinoceros during a standardized test of reactivity to a novel object and a novel conspecific scent. Tests were videotaped and analyzed by one researcher. Frequencies and durations of behaviors observed during the tests were correlated with scores on all six rated behavior traits. Scores on friendly to keeper, dominant, and olfactory behaviors described differences between black rhinoceros of captive/wild caught origin, age,and sex, respectively. Among successfully breeding males, scores on dominant and olfactory behaviors were negatively correlated with reproductive success, as was chasing/stereotypy/mouthing for females. To test the repeatability of these results, during 1996-1997, we used a modified questionnaire to re-survey 70 black rhinoceros at 24 zoos. Results of the second survey were also similar to those of the first with respect to the behaviors that distinguish rhinoceros of different origin, age, sex, and reproductive success.

A new interview measure of life events and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been developed for children and adolescents aged 9 through 17, for use in both epidemiological and clinical studies. It includes 'high magnitude' events associated with PTSD as well as other 'low magnitude' events. Method. The interview is designed as a module of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, an interviewer-based interview conducted with parent and child separately by trained lay interviewers. The module includes: (1) questions about a wide range of events; (2) a screen for key PTSD symptoms (painful recall, avoidance, hypervigilance); and (3) a detailed interview on all PTSD symptoms, including onset, duration, severity and co-morbidity. A test-retest reliability study was conducted with 58 parents and children, who were interviewed twice by different interviewers. Results. Intraclass correlations were 0.72 (child) and 0.83 (parent) for high magnitude events, and 0.62 (child) and 0.58 (parent) for low magnitude events. Kappa coefficients ranged from high for violence and sexual abuse to low for child reports of serious accidents and natural disasters. The reliability of the PTSD screen symptoms was fair to excellent (κ = 0.40-0.79), and reliability of PTSD symptoms in those who passed the screen was excellent (ICC = 0.94-0.99). Compared with a general population sample (N = 1015), the clinic-referred subjects and their parents were twice as likely to report a traumatic event and, depending on the event, up to 25 times as likely to report symptoms of PTSD. Conclusions. The results support the reliability and discriminant validity of the measure.",,"accident; adolescent; article; avoidance behavior; child psychiatry; comorbidity; disaster; female; human; interview; life event; major clinical study; male; parent; posttraumatic stress disorder; recall; reliability; school child; sexual abuse; symptom; violence; Adolescent; Child; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Personality Assessment; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","Costello, E.J.; Developmental Epidemiology Program, Duke University Medical Center, Dept.

In contrast to previous studies, agreement was examined using statistical indices that corrected for chance agreement and discrepancies in scores (i.e., intraclass correlation [ICC], kappa) in addition to traditional indices (i.e., Pearson correlation and percentage agreement) typically used in the relatively sparse literature on teacher agreement for adolescent behavior ratings. Agreement was poor for dimensional subscale scores (Pearson correlations were in the .40-.50 range, and ICCs were in the .20-.50 range) as well as for categorization of youth as above or below clinical cutoffs (percentage agreement was between 52% and 96%, but ICCs and kappas ranged from .17 to .57).

Arena behaviour was measured in an approach/avoidance test wherein animals were placed alone in a narrow arena for 10 min. During this period, their attraction to a group of sheep in a pen at one end of the arena relative to their avoidance of a human being sitting in the arena in front of this pen was assessed by quantifying five behaviours; minimum, mean and maximum distance from the human, total distance moved in the arena and number of bleats. These behavioural measurements were made at 6, 12 and 20 months of age. Of the five behaviours measured, total distance travelled consistently differed between the two flocks, Fertility Flock animals travelling, on average, only 60% as far as the Random Flock animals. Number of bleats also differed between the two flocks, but only at 6 and 12 months of age. Importantly, these differences appeared in both ewes and rams. The study also showed that these behaviours were all moderately to highly repeatable. These results further support the possible usefulness of arena behaviour as a means of genetically improving the lamb-rearing ability of ewes and indicate that rapid genetic progress may be possible since these behaviours can be measured early in the life of animals and in animals of both sexes.","Maternal behavior; Open field test; Sheep; Vocalization and temperament",,"Kilgour, R.J.; NSW Agriculture, Agricultural Research Centre, Trangie, NSW 2823, Australia; email: bob.kilgour@smtpgwy.agric.nsw.gov.au",,"Elsevier",01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

Using an experimental stream channel, we found repeatable differences in downstream movement behaviour among newly emerged chinook fry. Fish that moved downstream were larger than those that held position in the channel. However, the incidence of downstream movement behaviours decreased over the first 2 weeks after emergence. We propose that the variation among individuals in downstream movement behaviour we observed leads to the dispersal of newly emerged fry throughout all available rearing habitats.

This study examined whether individual aggressiveness can be measured in a resident-intruder situation and whether it is a stable characteristic of individuals, which does not simply reflect the age or sex class of the animal. These latter requirements are of fundamental importance in establishing the existence of individual personality or temperament characteristics in animals. The research was carried out in three datasets, with a total of 218 pigs, females and entire males, at the age of 7 and 11 weeks. For the test, individual pigs were isolated in one half of their home pen, and an intruder pig was introduced. This pig was 2-3 weeks younger than the resident pig. The time from when the resident first made contact to when it attacked the intruder pig was used as a measure of aggressiveness. If the resident did not attack, the test was terminated after 3.5 min. The test was repeatable across two consecutive clays as well as across four weeks. Aggressiveness was found to be unrelated to characteristics of the test pigs, such as sex, age, body weight and body weight ranked within litter. Attack latency was not affected by the sex of the intruder pig. If the intruder was less than half the body weight of the test pig, it was less likely to be attacked. Considerable variation was found within as well as between litters. The importance of the nature of the test arena, and implications of the duration of the test are discussed. Using attack latency as a measure of aggressiveness and a relatively short time limit, the test provides a useful tool for measuring aggressiveness without compromising the welfare of the animals involved.","Aggression; Measuring; Pig-agonistic behaviour; Resident-intruder situation; Tests","age class; aggression; body weight; pig; resident intruder interaction; sex class; Sus scrofa","Erhard, H.W.; Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen AB 15 8QH, United Kingdom",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","APPL.

The questionnaire was designed to be routinely applied within a visit at an Occupational Medical Center. A new questionnaire was developed with this aim, consisting of 9 subscales presented in a Lickert form, with 4 modes of answer, scored from 0 to 3. The content of the 9 items covers the multiple facets of perceived stress and its consequences: <<feeling of being under pressure>>, <<impatience>>, <<irritability>>, <<intrusive thoughts about work>>, <<inability to entertain>>, <<discouragement>>, <<morning fatigue>>, <<food compensation>>, <<compensation by smoking>>. Stress global score is defined as the sum of the 9 elementary scores. The first 7 items are similar in their construct to the 7 factor solutions of the principal component factor analysis performed on Levenstein Perceived Stress Questionnaire (1993). On the other hand, in comparison with Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (1983), our instrument keeps an important place for affective, physiologic and behavioral impact of stressing situations. A study on the homogeneity of the scale, its factorial structure, and its time reproducibility after 6 weeks of interval, was carried out on a first population of 91 subjects seen during an occupational medical visit in several companies of Paris district (PCV-Metra group). The coefficient of internal consistency is very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0,82). Principal component analysis extracted two factors, which were unchanged after a Varimax rotation and respectively represented 42 % and 13 % of the total variance: they can be interpretate as a general perceived stress component (being overwhelmed, loss of control) and a behavioral bipolar component opposing food compensation to smoking, whilst facing stressing situations. Test-retest correlation coefficient is 0.88 (Pearson r as well as intraclass correlation coefficient), without any significant gap between the first and the second assessment. A second study was carried out on 761 working individuals seen in the same conditions during an occupational medical visit in the same companies (596 males and 65 females, aged 40. 1 ± 8.8 years). Socio-demographic data analysis showed higher stress scores in females (10.2 ± 4.0), than in males (8.5 ± 3. 7) (p < 0. 0001). Detailed analysis sh wed differences related to gender in the same direction for the items <<irritability>>, <<discouragement>>, <<morning fatigue>> and <<food compensation>>. Highest stress scores, for both males and females, were found for the items <<intrusive thoughts about work>> and <<morning fatigue>>. Stress global score was correlated with socioprofessional status (SPS) : unskilled and skilled workers (n = 39) as well as technicians (n = 346) exhibited lower scores than clerical workers (n = 108) or engineers (n = 162) (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). The comparison between mean scores performed separately by gender, given the different sex-ratio according to SPS (employees were mostly females) confirmed the association between stress score and SPS only in males, with blue collars and technicians looking less under stress than engineers. Metrological properties of this Perceived Stress Questionnaire incite to perform studies focused on the associations between such a stress index measured in an occupational setting, and several other clinical or biological variables, especially those supposed to constitute classical cardiovascular risk factors.","Occupational Medicine; Perceived stress; Questionnaire; Reliability; Validity","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental stress; occupational health; psychologic assessment; questionnaire; rating scale; reliability; scoring system; work capacity; Adult; Defense Mechanisms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Personality Inventory; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Psychological; Workload","Consoli, S.M.; Unite Medico-Psychologique, INSERM Unite 258, Hopital Broussais, 96 rue Didot, 75674 Paris Cedex 14, France",,,00137006,,ENCEA,"9333549","French","ENCEPHALE",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030854801

In D. anilis, a mating consists of a copulation followed by tapping sequences during which the male taps the external genitalia of the female. These tapping sequences increase last male sperm precedence. Each male in the experiment was repeatedly mated with a set of females. In the first treatment, mating was interrupted after the male had an intromission. In the second treatment, the male was allowed to perform five tapping sequences after an intromission. In the third treatment, the male was allowed to perform an unlimited number of tapping sequences after an intromission until interrupted by female resistance. There were large differences between males in all three treatments as shown by the 95% confidence limits of the mean fertilization success. Repeatabilities of mating time and the number of tapping movements per tapping sequence were high indicating clear differences between males in these components of mating behaviour. Within individual males, the more tappings per sequence, the higher the fertilization success. In matings with an unlimited number of tapping sequences, fertilization success depended on female resistance.

The assessment takes a 'diagnostic' approach; concentrating on factors that have been shown in research to be good predictors of parenting dysfunction. These include parental personality, current mental state and degree of current social stress and support (including quality of marital relationship). Additionally, information regarding the adult's representation of early attachment relationships is elicited using the Adult Attachment Interview.

Items were assigned to a genetic or environmental scale on the basis of significant MZ/DZ differences in proband-wise concordance rates. Weights were assigned to items based on factor analyses. For the genetic scale, significant differences were found between MZ and DZ intraclass correlations. No significant differences were found between MZ and DZ correlations on the environmental scale. When scores on the environmental scale were controlled, genetic scale scores were correlated with earlier age of onset of alcohol problems and a shorter interval between first intoxication and onset of alcohol problems. When scores on the genetic scale were controlled, environmental scale scores were correlated with later age of onset of alcohol problems and a longer interval between first intoxication and onset of alcohol problems.

Individuals within couples tended to be opposite in 'butch/femme' ratings [intraclass r(26) = -0.77, p < 0.001] but similar in testosterone levels [intraclass r(26) = 0.47, p < 0.01].

Repeated recordings of individual males on seven nights revealed significant differences among males in calling rate on all but one night and differences in number of pulses per call and number of pulses produced per hour (pulse effort) on four nights. Most males reduced calling activity late at night (after 2230 h), but some maintained a relatively steady rate of call production before dropping out of the chorus. Data collected for 26 individuals recorded on three or more nights throughout the breeding season revealed significant differences among males in calling rate, number of pulses per call, and pulse effort, but repeatabilities for all three variables were low (0.17, 0.35, and 0.12, respectively). The highest repeatability was for number of pulses per call, a variable strongly influenced by proximity to calling neighbors, probably because males often interacted with neighbors at similar distances on several successive nights. Males tended to reduce the number of pulses per call as the season progressed and the distance between neighbors decreased, but they showed no clear seasonal change in calling rate or pulse effort. There was a substantial seasonal decline in the number of hours of chorus activity, resulting in a median decrease of 43% in nightly energy expenditure by calling males. © 1994 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.","Amphibia; Anura; Energetics; Hyla versicolor; Hylidae; Individual variation; Seasonal variation; Vocal behavior",,"Wells, K.D.; Department of Zoology, University of Maryland, CollegePark, MD 20742, United States",,,10452249,,BEECE,,"English","Behav.

A focus on individual differences rather than group statistics has revealed that low doses of ethanol cause large and repeatable increases in aggressive behavior in subgroups of rodents and primates. The recent progress using in vivo neuropharmacological techniques makes it feasible to explore differences in brain mechanisms in animals that show enhanced aggression after ethanol vs those that do not. Effects of ethanol on three major neurotransmitter systems (i.e. GABA, serotonin, dopamine) are examined. Since these neurotransmitter substances are critically important in the neurobiology of various kinds of aggressive behavior in rodent and primate species, they are potential mechanisms by which ethanol alters aggressive behavior. Direct research on the relevance of the physiological interaction between ethanol and the GABA receptor suggests that at least some of the effects of alcohol on aggression involve the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The role of serotonin (5-HT) will have to be newly defined in light of the findings that ethanol increases 5-HT release in several forebrain areas, in a dose range that can stimulate aggressive behavior in a subgroup of individuals. Recent in vivo studies show that acute exposure to ethanol increases dopamine release in discrete dopamine terminal areas, and that the initiation and execution of aggressive and defensive behavior are also synchronized with increased dopamine activity in these brain regions.","aggressive behavior; benzodiazepine; dopamine; ethanol; GABA; serotonin","1 (3 trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine; 2 dipropylamino 8 hydroxytetralin; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor blocking agent; 8 azido 5,6 dihydro 5 methyl 6 oxo 4h imidazo[1,5 a][1,4]benzodiazepine 3 carboxylic acid ethyl ester; alcohol; benzodiazepine; benzodiazepine receptor blocking agent; benzodiazepine receptor inverse stimulating agent; bicuculline; buspirone; dopamine; dopamine receptor blocking agent; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; flesinoxan; flumazenil; gepirone; ipsapirone; n methyl beta carboline 3 carboxamide; neuroleptic agent; neurotransmitter; picrotoxin; serotonin; serotonin agonist; serotonin antagonist; tropisetron; aggression; alcohol intoxication; animal model; behavior; crime; dopaminergic system; GABAergic system; human; individuality; mouse; neuropharmacology; nonhuman; primate; rat; review; rodent; serotoninergic system","Miczek, K.A.; Department of Psychology, Tufts University, 490 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155, United States",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",09558810,,BPHAE,,"English","BEHAV.

The 40-g birds carry on average 1-2 kg of stones during periods of 2-22 days (average 7·8), and stone carrying is therefore costly in terms of time and energy. Five functional explanations for the maintenance of this behaviour are considered. (1) The nest support hypothesis, that stones form a solid base for the nest, is refuted because large horizontal nest cavities with no need for nest support contained as many stones as those in other sites, nests were frequently situated in sites without stones, and stones were carried to sites not subsequently used for nests. (2) The thermoregulation hypothesis, that stones may moderate large diel temperature fluctuations and thus reduce the cost of incubation and brooding, is refuted because nests were frequently situated in sites without stones, there were as many stones in caves where temperatures fluctuated little as in natural cavities where temperatures varied widely, hatching success was unrelated to the number of stones and the cooling rate of nest contents was not affected by the presence of stones. (3) The weather protection hypothesis, that a large number of stones may protect the nest from wind, rain, or dust, is refuted because nests were frequently situated in sites without stones, and no case of nest failure owing to inclement weather was recorded. (4) The anti-predation hypothesis, that stones may prevent predation of nest contents or incubating females, is also refuted because stone carrying prevented use of relatively safe nest sites above 3·5 m, and nests suffering from predation had as many stones as successful nests. (5) The sexual display hypothesis, that pair members use the stone-carrying display to assess the quality of the partner and adjust their relative parental investment accordingly, does account for the behaviour since clutch size was positively and laying date negatively correlated with the number of stones carried to cavities other than nest sites, and the seasonal production of young was positively associated with the seasonal number of stones carried to cavities other than nest sites. The number of stones carried to nest sites had less predictive capacity. Stone carrying was also associated with the extent of paternal care. The behaviour showed a relatively high repeatability within and between seasons, implying strong and consistent differences between individuals. Stone carrying in the black wheatear can therefore be considered a post-mating but prenesting sexual display which allows adjustment of reproductive effort by females to the parental and/or phenotypic quality of partners. © 1993 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,"black wheatear; display; parental investment; reproductive effort; stone carrying; Aves; Oenanthe leucura",,,,00033472,,,,"English","Anim.

Although week‐to‐week correlations were modest (intraclass correlations of .14–.36), aggregates of the 8 observations had high reliability for both observers and mothers. Mother reports were tied to our observation sessions by having mothers (a) rate their infants' behavior during the period when our observations were made and (b) use a questionnaire that mirrored the scoring system used for scoring the videotaped observation sessions. When direct observations were compared with mother reports (on the aggregated weekly reports and on 4 widely used questionnaires), little evidence of mother‐observer correspondence was found. The interpretation of the large literature that has used maternal report is discussed, as well as the importance of direct observation of infant behavior when temperament is assessed.

Method: The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for adult schizophrenia was modified through successive field trials on the basis of developmental characteristics of children and adolescents. The scale was then given to 34 inpatients (19 children, mean age=9.35 years, and 15 adolescents, mean age=14.33 years) with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizoaffective, affective, conduct, personality, and developmental disorders determined independently by child psychiatrists. All patients with schizophrenia were placed in the schizophrenic group, and all others were placed in a general inpatient group. The Kiddie-PANSS ratings were given by three trained child psychiatrists after a 30-35-minute structured interview. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms were also administered in order to determine criterion-related association. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed that all subscales and total psychopathology were reliably assessed among raters. The Kiddie-PANSS and Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms/Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms correlated with one another, indicating criterion-related association. Differences on measures of positive, negative, and general psychopathology, as measured by the Kiddie-PANSS, between the patients with schizophrenia and the general inpatient group were highly significant. Conclusions: The Kiddie-PANSS shows good interrater reliability and criterion-related validity. In a cohort of inpatient children and adolescents the scale successfully differentiated schizophrenic patients from nonschizophrenic patients.",,"adolescent; article; behavior disorder; child; child psychiatry; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease classification; female; human; male; personality disorder; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia","Fields, J.H.; Bronx Children's Psychiatric Center, 1000 Waters Place, Bronx, NY 10461, United States",,"American Psychiatric Association",0002953X,,AJPSA,"8296898","English","AM.

The present review highlights the large individual differences in the effects of acute low alcohol doses on aggressive behavior in rodent and primate species, paralleling the human condition. Subpopulations of both species show reliable and repeatable enhancement of aggressive behavior when administered low, acute alcohol doses. Statistical analysis of the temporal patterns of aggressive behavior indicate that alcohol prolongs aggressive bouts or 'bursts' and increases the number of aggressive behaviors within each burst. However, the latency to initiate attack and the time between aggressive bursts are relatively unaltered by alcohol. These alcohol-induced increases in aggression can be potentiated by benzodiazepine agonists and prevented by antagonists. In addition, highly aggressive animals can be differentiated from nonaggressive ones at the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. These data suggest an important link between alcohol, aggression and the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.",,"4 aminobutyric acid a receptor; alcohol; benzodiazepine receptor; benzodiazepine receptor blocking agent; benzodiazepine receptor stimulating agent; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; alcohol; benzodiazepine derivative; aggression; alcohol consumption; animal behavior; animal experiment; conference paper; drug alcohol interaction; nonhuman; primate; rodent; serotoninergic system; animal; drug effect; female; male; metabolism; primate; review; rodent; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Benzodiazepines; Ethanol; Female; Male; Primates; Receptors, GABA-A; Rodentia","Miczek, K.A.; Department of Psychology, Research Building, Tufts University, 490 Boston Avenue, Medford, MA 02155, United States",,,0096882X,,JSALD,"8410959","English","J.

Inconsistencies in approaches to measuring memories of early separation anxiety may have contributed to this lack of clarity. We report the development of a brief self-report instrument, the Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory (SASI), which was designed to overcome some of these deficiencies in measurement. The SASI was shown to have a coherent factorial structure, high internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha>.80) and test-retest reliability over an average of 24 months (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient =. 89), with serial scores not being affected by changes in contemporaneous anxiety levels. Some index of the validity of the measure was achieved by (a) comparing SASI scores of index twins with descriptors of their “insecure’ behaviours in early life provided by corresponding co-twins; (b) comparing SASI scores with retrospective DSM III-R diagnoses of early anxiety disorders obtained by structured interviews; and (c) examining SASI scores in subjects with histories of school refusal.

This study investigated several other measures of the push-up display, including display frequency, display perch height and number of legs flexed in displays as well as the head-bob pattern. It also examined the behaviour of both adult male and female lizards in the field. Repeatable individual differences occurred in all of the variables examined. These differences may be indicative of differences in home-range quality, motivational state, or may be used for individual recognition. Differences between the sexes occurred in display frequency, number of head-bobs per display and display duration, but not in display perch height, nor in number of legs flexed per display. Sex differences in the head-bob pattern suggest that the push-up displays of males and females may be qualitatively different, and possibly used for different purposes. © 1991.",,"display; sagebrush lizard","Martins, E.P.; Department of Zoology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States",,,00033472,,ANBEA,,"English","Anim.

We found that monkeys could be trained to make sufficiently reliable and stable fixations to enable us to plot and characterize the receptive fields of individual neurons. A qualitative examination of rasters and a statistical analysis of the data revealed that the responses of neurons were related to the stimuli. The data from 5 of the 13 'X-like' neurons in our sample indicated the presence of antagonistic center and surround mechanisms and linear summation of luminance within center and surround mechanisms. We attribute the lack of evidence for surround antagonism in the eight neurons that failed to exhibit center-surround antagonism either to a mismatch between the size of the pixels in the stimuli and the size of the receptive field or to the lack of a surround mechanism (i.e., the type II neurons of Wiesel and Hubel). The data from five other neurons confirm and extend previous reports indicating that the surround regions of X-like neurons can have nonlinearities. The responses of these neurons were not modulated when a contrast-reversing, bipartite stimulus was centered on the receptive field, which suggests a linear summation within the center and surround mechanisms. However, it was frequently the case for these neurons that stimuli of identical pattern but opposite contrast elicited responses of similar polarity, which indicates nonlinear behavior. We found a wide variety of temporal patterns in the responses of individual LGN neurons, which included differences in the magnitude, width, and number of peaks of the initial on-transient and in the magnitude of the later sustained component. These different temporal patterns were repeatable and clearly different for different visual patterns. These results suggest that visual information may be carried in the shape as well as in the amplitude of the response waveform.",,"animal experiment; article; controlled study; lateral geniculate nucleus; male; monkey; nonhuman; photosensitivity; priority journal; visual stimulation","McClurkin, J.W.; NEI/LSR Bldg. 10, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States",,,00223077,,JONEA,"1753287","English","J.

Subjects were 37 MZ and 7 DZ twins aged from 18 to 45 years. In males, blood uric acid level increased with age, while it decreased with age in females. Blood uric acid level was corrected and standardized using regression lines separately for males and females. The distribution of standardized uric acid level corresponded well with the theoretical curve of normal distribution. The intraclass correlation coefficient for standardized uric acid level was r = 0.370 (P < 0.05) for the 37 MZ twins, but not significant for the 7 DZ twins. These findings suggest that blood uric acid level is genetically controlled. By the analysis of 12 personality traits in YG (Yatabe-Guilford) character test, it was revealed that ''General activity'' was more controlled by genetically than environmentally. In the evaluation of the correlation between standardized uric acid level and the YG 12 personality traits, significant correlation was observed in ''Lack of agreeableness'' and ''Rhathymia''. Since these two personality traits include the factor of ''activity'', it is concluded that the plasma uric acid level and activity in a broader sense are under genetic control.

The possible influence of social factors on shade-use is examined in this paper. Two measures of dominance were made on 39 Merino wethers. These were based on the hierarchy determined by butting during feeding and on priority of access to limited feed. Leadership was also assessed while driving the sheep to a woolshed and as the sheep entered weighing scales. These behavioural traits were compared with leadership to shade and shade-use observed on 9 days during summer in a small pastureless enclosure containing natural shade. Maximum ambient temperature on these 9 days varied between 29.0 and 39.5°C. All behavioural traits examined were significantly repeatable. The two dominance ranks were negatively correlated (P<0.05). The butting hierarchy was correlated with shading behaviour; those sheep that butted the larger proportion of the flock were seen to shade for longer periods of time (P=0.05). This relationship became more significant as environmental temperature increased. Significant (P<0.05) differences in the amount of time each sheep spent shading were evident throughout the flock, but in particular seven individuals shaded much less than others. Shade-use increased in hot weather and was slightly more strongly correlated with radiation load than with air temperature. The non-shading leadership ranks were related neither to each other nor to the leadership to shade. However, the sheep that moved to shade first remained there longest (P<0.05). Reduced motivation to feed did not appear to explain early movement to shade. Few overtly aggressive or other interactions between animals were seen to be associated with movements to or within shade. Nonetheless, the results indicate that social forces do exert some influence on shade-use. © 1987.",,,"Sherwin, C.M.; Veterinary School, Murdoch University, Perth, W.A. 6150, Australia",,,01681591,,AABSE,,"English","Appl.

First, an index of empathic concern was created by combining relevant items from Gough's Adjective Check List (ACL). This index was validated by correlating scores of 88 undergraduates on the index with their scores on a self‐report measure of empathy, which has been related to prosocial behavior. Correlations were sufficiently high to accept the validity of the index. Next, previously collected ACL responses of 114 monozygotic (MZ) and 116 dizygotic (DZ) twins were reanalyzed in order to create an empathic concern score for each twin. The twins were middle‐aged males initially raised together but living apart at the time they completed the ACL. Comparison of intraclass correlations for MZ and DZ twins revealed, as predicted by the genetic hypothesis, significant (p < .005) heritability in empathic concern scores. This finding suggests that there may, indeed, be a genetic influence on individual differences in empathic concern for others. Some limitations of the present data are also considered. How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him.

Ninety-two middle-class children (members of 21 identical twin pairs and 25 same-sex fraternal twin pairs, with an average age of 22.2 months) were observed in their homes using time-sampled observations of specific behaviors in seven situations: (a) a 5-minute warm-up period, (b) approach by stranger, (c) play with stranger, (d) play with mother, (e) cuddling with mother, (f) cuddling with stranger, and (g) separation from mother. Comparisons between intraclass correlations for identical and fraternal twins yielded significant differences for social behavior directed toward the stranger but not toward the mother. In addition, a novel measure of attachment using the difference in social responding toward the mother and stranger suggested heritable influences only in the initial warm-up situation. We conclude that in infancy, heredity affects individual differences in social responding more to unfamiliar persons than to familiar persons. The behavioral-genetic analysis also suggests that the substantial influence of environment in the development of social behavior may occur primarily within families (making members of a family different from one another-including systematic as well as stochastic effects) rather than between families (making family members similar to one another and different from other families), as is widely assumed.

Ewes were made hypocupraemic by feeding a copper-deficient diet and the subsequent responses in plasma Cu obtained when Cu was added to the diet were used to assess the biological availability of the added Cu. 2. The uniformity of responses was investigated by repleting thirty-six ewes for 33 d on two occasions with a standard diet containing 5.0 mg Cu/kg dry matter (DM). The mean responses were 0.36 and 0.33 mg/l and the coefficient of variation was approximately 53% on each occasion. The marked individual differences were largely repeatable, the correlation coefficient (r) within individuals being 0.68 (P &lt; 0.001). 3. A dose: response relationship was investigated by giving five groups of seven ewes diets containing 2.7, 4.2, 5.7, 7.2 or 8.7 mg Cu/kg DM for 33 d. Each increment in dietary Cu above 4.2 mg/kg significantly increased the response in plasma Cu. The relationship between plasma Cu response (y, mg/l) and Cu intake (x, mg/d) after 21 d was y = 0.0871x−0.250 (r = 0.99; 3 df). 4. The source of individual variation was investigated by comparing the responses of three ‘slow’ and three ‘fast’ responding ewes from Expt 1 to Cu given as a continuous intravenous infusion at rates of 0.05–0.3 mg/d. The relationship between plasma Cu response (y) and infusion rate (x, mg/d) after 17 d, was y = 2.135x –0.156 (r = 0.86; P &lt; 0.001). The regression coefficients for ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ responding ewes were similar, as was their metabolism of intravenous 64Cu, suggesting that the individual differences were due to differences in absorption rather than in the metabolism of absorbed Cu. Faecal endogenous Cu excretion was estimated to be 0.127 ± 0.019 (mean ± SE) mg/d. 5. The relative responses to oral and intravenous Cu were used to estimate the true availability of dietary Cu; in one experiment it was 4.1% and for individual ewes in another experiment, availabilities ranged from 4.5 to 11.4%. The figures are compared with assessments by conventional techniques. 6. It is concluded that the repletion technique provides a sensitive means of assessing the availability of Cu in ruminant diets. © 1974, The Nutrition Society.
