# What happened so far:
# (1) WoS and Scopus search (see file 1_)
# (2) Rayyan abstract screening: 218 articles tagged with longer period / more than 2 measurements
# (3) exported to bibtex, changed "url" to "doi" in bibtex file, imported in zotero
# (4) downloaded pdfs in zotero and not exported csv file with standard utf encoding and "notes"
